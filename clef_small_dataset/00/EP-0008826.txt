<ABSTRACT>
a suspension of fiuorescence-stained bacteria is applied as a film, preferably of a thickness of 2 - 7  mu m, on the edge of a rotating disc, and the film is illuminated with u. v.  light.  through a microscope, light impulses from bacteria in the film passing a zone of preferably 2 - 4  mu m transverse to direction of movement of the disc edge are transferred to a transducer, and the electrical signals from the transducer are discriminated according to size and signals exceeding a predetermined size are counted.  disc preferably has a diameter of 8 - 12 cm and rotates at 10 - 40 rpm.  fluorochrome dye is preferably acridine orange or ethidium bromide.  method for staining comprises increasing contrast between bacteria and background by incubating with a proteolytic enzyme, or incubating in a nutrient medium containing an antibiotic preventing division of bacteria, or adding formaldehyde when staining with acridine orange.  separation of bacteria from a sample comprises centrifugation with a higher density liquid system comprising continuous or discontinuos density gradient, especially in a dish-like centrifuge in which sample passes over two-component liquid system to move bacteria to interface between components.
