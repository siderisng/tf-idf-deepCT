<ABSTRACT>
a pair of ceramic chips (56, 58), formed of similar  metal oxide ceramic materials which are semiconductors  at elevated temperature, are connected electrically in series  and are arranged for exposure to the hot gaseous combustion  by-products produced by an internal combustion  engine.  the chips are positioned in the exhaust gas conduit  by a ceramic insulator (48) having a plurality of longitudinal  passages extending therethrough.  a plurality of electrical  terminal members (60, 62, 64) are received within  the rear of the longitudinal passages.  electrical leads (66,  68, 70, 72) extend from the chips (56, 58) to the terminal  members (60, 62, 64) through the plurality of passages  and support the chips while providing electrical communication  between the chips and the electrical terminals.   the electrical terminals (60, 62, 64) are adapted for communication  to electronic and/or electrical utilization means.   one (58) of the pair of chips is processed to exhibit a  rapid change in an electrical property responsive to differences  in the exhaust gas chemistry and differences in  exhaust gas temperature.  the other (56) of the chips is  processed to exhibit a rapid change in an electrical property  responsive to differences in exhaust gas temperature only.   the preferred material is titania.  for temperatures in the  range of from about 700°f to about 1500°f, the application  of a reference voltage across the series connected  chips (56, 58) will produce a substantially temperature  independent voltage variation across either chip in response  to changes in exhaust gas chemistry and which is relatively  insensitive to changes in the exhaust gas temperature.
