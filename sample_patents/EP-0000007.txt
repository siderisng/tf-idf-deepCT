<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the polymerization of alphaolefins as well as the soli catalytic complexes of use for this polymerization and a method for their preparation. The solid catalytic complexes are prepared in fact react between: (1) at least one compound selected from organic oxygen compounds and the halogenated compounds of magnés SIUM; (2) at least one compound selected from organic oxygen compounds and the halogenated compounds of titanium; (3) At least one aluminum halide. The aluminum halide is selected from the organoaluminous chlorides of general formula A1RNC13-N wherein R is an alkyl radical comprising at least 4 carbon atoms and n is a number such as 1 ≦ N ≦ 2. The polymerization method allows To obtain, with very high catalytic activities, polyolefins whose percentage of fine particles is reduced and whose average particle size is higher.
