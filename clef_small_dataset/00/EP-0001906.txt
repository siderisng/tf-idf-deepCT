<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to foundary compositions  containing propylene glycol monoacetate, a silica base and a  silicate.  the use of propylene glycol monoacetate as ester  hardeners imparts greater compressive strength to foundry  cores and the strength is built up more rapidly than with  conventional ester hardeners.  this is believed to be due at  least in part to the total miscibility of this ester with water  and to the purity of the ester product.
