<ABSTRACT>
in the manufacture of explosive fusecord stranded reinforcing wrapping material is helically spun around an encased fusecord core by advancing the fusecord core axially through at least one supply reel of wrapping material and training at least one strand of wrapping material from the reel around the fusecord core by means of a driven flyer rotating around the fusecord core.  strands of wrapping material may be trained from two or more supply reels preferably mounted in line co-axially with the path of the fusecord core.  the method permits faster production than can be achieved by the conventional method wherein the wrapping material is applied from supply reels rotating orbitally around the path of the fusecord core.
