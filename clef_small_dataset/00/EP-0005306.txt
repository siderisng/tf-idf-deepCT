<ABSTRACT>
apparatus and a method disclosed for use in bending  heated sheets of glass (g) transported generally horizontally  on a conveyor (16) within a furnace heating chamber  incorporate a holder (20) located above the conveyor (16)  in a spaced relationship such that a heated sheet of glass  can be transported under the holder (20).  gas such as  air is blown upwardly through restricted opening (40)  below the conveyor (16) into impingement with the heated  sheet of glass (g) such that the sheet is moved upwardly  into engagement with the holder (20).  a mold ring is then  movable under the holder (20) to receive the glass sheet  (g) for bending.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus and method for bending glass technical field this invention relates to apparatus and a method for bending heated sheets of glass in a manner that is particularly adaptable for use prior to quenching of the bent sheet of glass so as to thereby provide tempering of the glass in order to increase its mechanical strength. background art bent and tempered glass is used extensively for vehicle side and rear windows to provide good resistance to breakage as well as an aesthetically appealing shape that complements the design of the vehicle. in order to perform the bending and tempering, sheet glass must be heated to its deformation point of about 12000 to 13000 f and then bent to the required shape before being rapidly cooled by an air spray in order to temper the glass. tempering greatly increases the mechanical strength of the glass and its resistance to breakage as well as causing the glass to break into small relatively dull pieces when broken instead of into large sharp slivers as is the case with untempered glass. one manner in which glass is bent and tempered is with press benders having shaped surfaces between which heated glass is clamped to shape it prior to being air cooled by a quench unit to provide tempering. united states patents 3,454,389; 3,476,542; 3,488,178; 3,600,150; and 3,951,634 disclose press bending and tempering apparatus for sheet glass. sheet glass is also bent and tempered by heating of planar glass sheets while supported on bending molds including movable sections. prior to softening of the glass during heating the sections of the mold are oriented to accommodate for the glass sheet planarity. upon softening of the glass sheet as it is heated, the mold sections move relative to each other under the force of gravity acting on the sheet and the mold sections in order to provide bending of the sheet prior to rapid cooling thereof which provides its tempering, thin glass, i.e. on the order of 1/8", cannot be bent by this apparatus since it does not become hot enough- to temper until the glass becomes so soft that it overbends. united states patents 3,269,822 3,278,287; 3,307,930; and 3,365,285 disclose this type of bending and tempering apparatus. heating of glass sheets prior to bending and tempering thereof has also been performed on fluid support beds as the glass is conveyed through a furnace. normally the support bed is inclined slightly with respect 'to the horizontal so that gravity engages an edge of the glass with a movable frame that provides the impetus for glass movement along the bed. there is no contact between the bed and the oppositely facing surfaces of the glass during the conveyance as the glass is heated. this lack'of contact prevents marring and scratching of the soft surfaces of the glass as the glass reaches its deformation temperature. united states patents 3,497,340; 3,607,187; and 3,607,200 disclose glass bending and tempering apparatus of this type with a fluid support bed. vacuum forming of
