<ABSTRACT>
the device according to the invention is used for determining the road distance covered by a motor vehicle.  it is independent of the normally installed roadometer, but is dependent on the presence of a tachometer or stepping motor in the tachometer.  the magnetic shielding factor of the signals generated in the tachometer is utilized.  a magnetic sensor which can be mounted on the tachometer disc, e. g.  a hall-generator, supplies an alternating or pulsed signal proportional to the rotation of the tachometer shaft or to the signals of the stepping motor in the tachometer after electronic conditioning by an electronic counter.  the number of signals is then used as a measure of the road distance covered.  the sensor is mounted on the tachometer disc, in a releasable manner, for example with the aid of a suction cup.  in this way, the device can be installed in the motor vehicle subsequently and can be removed again, as required.  <image>
