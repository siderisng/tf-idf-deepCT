<ABSTRACT>
to overcome various problems associated with moulding  of steel, the moulds (5) are shot peened in between casts  using an air-blast system which incorporates a compressor  (4), a shot recovery and supply system (2), a dust collector  and control section (3, 3â€²) and a peening/cleaning station (1)  which has a nozzle assembly (9) arranged to traverse the  length of a mould (5) whilst rotating and simultaneously  firing shot at the interior mould surfaces to achieve a  peening effect.
