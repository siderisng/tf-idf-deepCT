<ABSTRACT>
specific polypeptides are prepared by expression of a  heterologous gene coding for them in a recombinant  microbial cloning vehicle.  the gene is arraged to be in  reading phase with a dna sequence coding for another  polypeptide so that when the dna is expressed a precursor  protein is produced comprising both the desired polypeptide  and the additional polypeptide, there being a cleavage site  between them where the precursor protein may subsequently  be cleaved.  plasmids or cloning vehicles containing this type of dna  sequence may be used to transform bacterial cultures in  particular to enable the bacteria to produce an immunogenic  substance comprising a polyeptide hapten, the dna sequence  coding for the hapten and an additional protein  sufficient in size to confer immunogenicity on the product of  expression and enable antibodies to be raised to it.  alternatively,  the bacteria may be enabled to produce a desired  polypeptide product e. g.  somatostatin linked to additional  protein from which the desired product may be cleaved.
