<ABSTRACT>
a brake applying device for an internal shoe drum brake  and comprising a hydraulic wheel cylinder (11) having pis­ tons (12, 13) operated to apply the brakes by one or both of  hydraulic pressure or a wedge assembly (14) that move  transversely of the wheel cylinder (11).  the wedge assembly  has a wedge (16) and rollers (21) which act between the  wedge (16) and the pistons (12, 13) to facilitate movement of  the wedge.  the rollers (21) are housed in a cage (22) that can  move relative to the wedge (16), the unloaded datum posi­ tion of the cage (22) on the wedge is determined by two  opposed springs (27 and 29) that act on the cage.  in order to  prevent the cage (22) from becoming damaged during  exceptional service conditions it has been arranged for the  cage (22) to move relative to the wedge (16) during the initial  application of the brakes.  this is achieved by providing an  abutment (38) which is encountered by the cage (22) during  retraction of the wedge (16) so as to compress one of said  springs (27).
