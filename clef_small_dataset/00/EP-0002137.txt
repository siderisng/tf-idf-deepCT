<ABSTRACT>
a belt conveyor in which the belt travels around a  lateral curve or curves and comprises load-supporting belt  sections (2) pivoted between transverse rods (1), has guide  blocks (4) at the ends of the transverse rods (1) with bearing  parts (20) which co-operate substantially without friction  with runners (5) at the or each curve to guide the belt  in its travel with reduced wear and tension.  preferably the  bearing parts (20) and runners (5) are made of self-lubricating  material.  in one form the bearing parts are horizontally facing  channels (20) in the blocks (4) engaged by tongue portions  (25) of the runners (5).  the blocks each have two  adjacent transverse rods (1) retained to them.  the transverse  rods are also connected by links (3) alternately arranged  against external surfaces of the blocks (4) and in  grooves (18) in the blocks where they are connected to  the rods.
