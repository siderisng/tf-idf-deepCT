<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for producing mouldings by mixing unsaturated polyester resin, inorganic fillers and magnesium oxide, thickening the resultant mixture in the presence of glass fibres, and moulding portions of the thickened compound at elevated temperature, this process being characterized in that, by the side of the unsaturated polyester resin the mixture contains 80-95% wt.  - referred to the total mixture - of inorganic fillers with a particle size lying mainly between 0 and 500 microns, 1-5% wt.  - referred to the total mixture - of glass fibres at least three-quarters of which are shorter than 15 mm and are present mainly as randomly distributed monofilaments, and 0. 5-5% wt.  - referred to the unsaturated polyester resin - of magnesium oxide, which mixture is thickened until it is compact and practically free of air.
