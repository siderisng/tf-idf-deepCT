<DESCRIPTION>
title: tie layer wor co-extruded achysonitrile - copoli'mrs. this invention relates to a mixture of a halogenated polyolefin, a nitrile barrier resin, optionally a polyurethane, and a polyolefin, and to the use of this mixture as a tie layer to adhere together a co- extruded polyolefin and nitrile barrier resin. composite structures composed of at least one layer of a polyolefin and at least one layer of a nitrile barrier resin have been prepared and are found to be useful for many purposes, primarily for packaging. packages of such composites have excellent gas barrier properties, they are particularly good barriers to oxgen, carbon dioxide and water vapour, and they can be fabricated by heat sealing because of the excellent heat-sealing properties of polyolefins. the manufacture of such composites is not easy because of the lack of adhesion between the surfaces of the polyolefin and the nitrile barrier resin this lack of adhesion has in the past been improved b the use of an adhesive, corona-discharge treatment of the polyolefin surface, and other methods including the use of a tie layer composed of a blend of the polyolefin and the nitrilecontaining polymer as described in u.s. patent no. 4,125,576. it is an object of the present invention to provide improved composite structures of polyolefins and nitrile barrier resins, by employing a polymeric mixture as a tie layer for adhering the polymer surfaces together. this invention therefore provides a laminated structure comprising (i) a first outer layer composed of a nitrile barrier resin, (ii) a second intermediate layer comprising a tie layer and, (iii) a third outer layer composed of a polyolefin characterised in that the layer comprises a mixture of (1) a nitrile barrier resin (i), (2) a polyolefin, and (3) a halogenated polyolefin. the proportions of the materials in the tie layer and the temperature at which the mixture is extruded affect both adhesion and viscosity control in the co-extrusion process. a significant advantage of the present invention is the fact that scrap material can be reground and used in the tie layer with some adjustment of the three essential components mentioned above. the polyolefins useful in the present invention include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, and interpolymers of two or more of ethylene, propylene, and the butylenes. polyethylene includes both highand low- density polymer. the most preferred polyolefins are polyethylene and polypropylene. the halogenated polyolefins useful in this invention include halogenated polyethylene, halogenated polypropylene, halogenated polybutylene, and halogenated olefin copolymers. preferred are chlorinated and brominated polyolefins and most preferred are chlorinated polyethylenes and chlorinated polypropylenes. the nitrile barrier resins useful in the present invention include those prepared by the polymerization of (a) from 60 to 900/o by weight of at least one nitrile having the structure emi2.1 in which r represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a halogen, (b) from 10 to 40f0 by weight based on the combined weight of (a) and (b) of (1) an ester having the structure emi3.1 in
