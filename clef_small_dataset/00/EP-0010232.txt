<ABSTRACT>
a herbicidal composition comprises a phenoxypentenoic  acid derivative having the formula    wherein r represents    and x represents a halogen atom or trifluoromethyl group;  y represents hydrogen atom or chlorine atom; r′ represents  an alkoxyl gorup, an alkenyloxy group, hydroxyl group, or  o. cat (cat=inorganic or organic cation) or sr″(r″= an alkyl  group), and a carbamate derivative having the formula    wherein r″ represents methyl or ethyl group; x′ represents  hydrogen atom or methyl group as active ingredients.

<DESCRIPTION>
background or the invention: the present invention relates to a herbicidal composition in which two active ingredients impart synergistic effect. recently, many herbicides have been proposed and practicaily used to contribute to elimination of agricultural labour works. thus, various problems on herbicidal effects and safety of the herbicides have been found in the practical applications. it has been awaited to find improved herbicides which have no adverse effect to the object plants and effective to noxious weeds in a small dose of the active ingredient and significantly safe without any environmental pollution. summary of the invention: it is an object of the present invention to provide a herbicidal composition which has excellent herbicidal effect and safety and which is especially effective to control weeds without phytotoxicity to beet. the herbicidal composition of the present invention comprises a phenoxypentenoic acid derivative having the formula emi1.1 <tb> <sep> ro-oc1±1ch=chcoi? <sep> (i) <tb> <sep> 3 <sep> ,ct <sep> ty <tb> wherein <sep> r <sep> represents <sep> ce <sep> or <sep> x and x represents a halogen atom or trifluoromethyl group; y represents hydrogen atom or chlorine atom; r' represents an alkoxyl group, an alkenyloxyl group, hydroxyl group or o- cat. (cat=inorganic or organic cation) or sr" (r"=an alkyl group) and a carbamate derivative having the formula emi2.1 wherein r"' l zpresents methyl or ethyl group; x' represents hydrogen atom or methyl group as active ingredients with a carrier. detailed description of the preferred embodiments: the phenoxypentenoic acid derivatives (i) used in the present invention have no phytotoxicity to broad-leaf weeds and are safe to broad leaf crop plants such as radish, soy bean, peanut, cotton, flax, beet, pimento and sunflower but are remarkably effective as herbicides to gramineous weeds such as barnyard grass, large crab grass, johnson grass, maize, quack grass, dent foxtail, and paspalum grass though they are less effective to annual bluegrass. on the other hand, the carbamate derivatives used in the present invention are substantially not effective as herbicides to gramineous weeds but are remarkably effective as herbicides to broad-leaf weeds though they are less effective to green amaranth in amaranthaceae and grown broad-leaf weed in high leaf stage such as pale smartweed in polygonaceae and has no phytotoxicity to beet in chenopa diaceae. the herbicidal compositions of the prcsent invention have the advantageous characteristic to maintain longer herbicidal effect than those of the application of each single component. the herbicidal compositions of the present invention have surprisingly unexpected high synergistic effect to broad-leaf weeds and gramineous weeds and a dose of the herbicides can be remarkably decreased. an absorption of the carbamate derivative into plants is improved by combining the phenoxypentenoic acid derivative with the carbamate derivative. therefore, it is possible to completely control broad-leaf weed in high leaf stage such as pale smartweed in polygonaceae and also green amaranth in amaranthaceae and annual bluegrass in gramineae which have not been effectively controlled by the conventional herbicides. therefore, it is possible to completely control grown broad-leaf weeds in high
