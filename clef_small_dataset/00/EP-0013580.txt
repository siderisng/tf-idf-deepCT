<ABSTRACT>
a steam generating heat exchanger of modular design  for cooling a high pressure, hot combustible gas laden with  molten ash particles comprising a first convective cooler (18)  having a vertically orientated u-shaped gas pass housing a  superheater and an evaporator, a radiant cooler (6) disposed  upstream of the first convective cooler and a second convecÂ­ tive cooler (40) housing an economizer disposed downstream  of the first convective cooler.  in-line tube bundles form the  superheat, evaporator, and the economizer thereby  minimizing ash deposition upon the heat transfer surface.  the  gas velocity within the radiant cooler is maintained low  enough to permit molten ash particles entrained in the gas to  coalesce and precipitate out of the gas stream, while the gas  velocity within the convective coolers is maintained high  enough to discourage ash deposition upon the heat transfer  surface.
