<ABSTRACT>
a scroll type fluid compressor unit having an orbiting  scroll member and a fixed scroll member which form at least  one sealed off fluid pocket therebetween for fluid compres­ sion.  each spiral element (232 [242]) of each scroll member  (23 [24]) is provided with a sealing element which is loosely  fitted in a groove (35) formed in an axial end surface of the  spiral element.  during the operation, the compressed pres­ sure fluid flows into the groove to urge the sealing element  towards the end plate of the opposing scroll member and to  the side wall of the groove, so that an axial sealing between  the spiral element and the opposing end plate is obtained.  the groove may be constituted by an upper portion hav­ ing a relatively wide opening and a lower portion having a rela­ tively narrow opening, and the sealing element is loosely fit­ ted into the upper portion of the groove so that the hollow  portion in which tho compressed pressure fluid is introduced  is readily formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to scroll type fluid compressor units, a scroll type apparatus has been well known in the prior art as disclosed in, for example, u.s, patent no. 801,182, and others, which comprises two scroll members each having an end plate and a spiroidal or involute spiral element. these scroll members are so maintained angularly and radially offset that their spiral elements interfit to make a plurality of line contacts between their spiral curved surfaces, thereby to seal off and define at least one fluid pocket. the relative orbital motion of these scroll members shifts the line contacts along the spiral curved surfaces and, therefore, the volume of the fluid pocket increases or decreases in dependence on the direction of the orbital motion. therefore, a scroll type apparatus is suitable for handling fluids or for compressing, expanding or pumping them. in comparison with conventional compressors of the piston type, a scroll type compressor has some advantages such as less number of parts, continuous compression of fluid and others. but, there have been several problems; primarily sealing of the fluid pocket, and others. in order to resolve such sealing problem, u.s, patent no. 3,924,977 discloses to non-rotatably support a fixed scroll member within the compressor housing in the axially floating condition. a high pressure fluid is introduced to the back of the fixed scroll member and, thereby, urge the fixed scroll member to the orbiting scroll member to establish a sufficient axial sealing. in this arrangement, since the fixed scroll member is supported in the axial floating condition, the support of the fixed-scroll member is insufficient so that the orbiting scroll member- tends to deflect by the orbital motion of the orbiting scroll member. therefore, the fluid compression tends to be performed imperfectly. in order to avoid such disadvantage, the pressure of the introduced high pressure fluid must be increased and the clearance between radial supporting parts must be made as small as possible. but it requires high accuracy of working parts to minimize the clearance. while the increase of the pressure of the introduced fluid results to the increased contact pressure between both scroll members which injures scroll members. another method for strengthening the axial sealing of fluid pockets is to use sealing elements which are mounted in the axial end surfaces of spiral elements, as disclosed in u.s. patent no. 3,994,635. the sealing element is urged towards the opposing circular plate by the use of the elastic element such as spring. in this arrangement, since the construction for urging the sealing element is complex, it is difficult to obtain the desired sealing force. according to the present invention there is provided a scroll type fluid compressor unit including a compressor housing having a fluid inlet port and fluid outlet port, a first scroll member disposed within said compressor housing and having first end plate means to which first wrap means are affixed, a second scroll member disposed within said compressor housing and having second end plate means to

claims:    1. a scroll type fluid compressor unit including a compressor housing having a fluid inlet port and fluid outlet port, a first scroll member disposed within said compressor means are affixed, a second scroll member disposed within said compressor housing and having second end plate means to which second wrap means are affixed, said first and second scroll members being superposed with said first and second wrap means interfitting, at a predetermined angular relationship, and having a plurality of line contacts so as to define at least one sealed off fluid pocket which moves with a reduction in volume thereof upon relative orbital motion of said first and second scroll members, thereby to compress fluid in the pocket, and driving means for causing the relative orbital motion of said first and second scroll members,  wherein each of said first and second wrap means is provided with a groove which is formed in the axial end surface thereof to trace the spiral curve of said wrap means, and sealing element means are loosely fitted in said groove and short of the bottom surface of said groove, whereby the compressed fluid flows into said groove to urge said sealing element means to adjacent ones of said first and second end plate means and to the side wall of said groove to make a sealing contact therebetween.     2. a unit as claimed in claim 1, wherein said groove comprises a lower portion which is adjacent the bottom thereof  and is relatively narrow, and an upper portion having a wide opening so that each side wall is stepped, said sealing element means being fitted in said upper portion.    3. a unit as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein each groove is formed to open in the inner terminal end face of the associated wrap means.    4. a unit as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said sealing element is of polytetrafluoroethylene.
