<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an improved contact device  suitable especially for use with manual control devices of the  pushbutton and rotary types.  the contact devices comprises an insulating housing  containing a contact structure, and terminal connectors  extending from the contact structure outwardly of the  housing through openings in wall portions thereof, wherein  the terminal connectors (173) are substantially z-shaped, and  the housing has interior flanges (183) which, together with  wall portions (162) of the housing adjacent the respective  openings, define pockets in which intermediate portions  (179) of the respective terminal connectors are lodged and  retained, the flanges in addition serving as insulating  barriers between the said intermediate portions of the  terminal connectors and the contact structure (153, 155, 157).  the novel arrangement enables the component parts of  the contact device to be mounted easily and without  hardware, and it prevents electric flashovers or arcing from  occurring between current-carrying parts disposed closely  adjacent each other.
