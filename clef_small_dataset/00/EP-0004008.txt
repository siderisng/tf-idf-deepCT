<ABSTRACT>
1.  amplitude decision device for digital signals having n amplitude stages with at least one schmitt-trigger (strx), characterized in that there are provided n-1 signal converters (swx), where n => 2, which are connected to the signal input and which are each set to one of the n-1 decision element thresholds which lie between the n amplitude stages, and that the signal converters produce parallel n-1 binary signals, that a respective tuned line (lx) which is shortcircuited at the end and whose length results in each case in a pulse transit time corresponding to half of the step period is connected to each signal output of the signal converters, that the lines produce n-1 parallel pseudo-ternary signals and that n-1 identical schmitt triggers (strx) which are connected to the signal outputs of the signal converters and which produce amplitude determined binary signals from the supplied pseudo-ternary signals, which binary signals can be combined in a new multistage signal either directly or after a time decision.
