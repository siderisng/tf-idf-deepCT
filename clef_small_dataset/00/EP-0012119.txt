<ABSTRACT>
automatic radar emission extractor connected to an  interceptor which converts impulse parameters such as carrier  frequency, direction of incidence, duration and amplitude  of received radar emission into digital form.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
automatic radar emission extractor the invention herein refers to an automatic radar emission extractor. in particular, it refers to the structural realization of an automatic radar emission extractor connected to an interceptor which is able to convert the impulse parameters of received radar emissions to digital form. such parameters at the carrying frequency, the direction oi origin, the dur@tion of impulse and the amplitude. for automatic radar emission extractor is intended a system which accepts data in codified Ã²rm rclative to cach impulse of all the radar emissions present in the electromagnetic environment as input, re-ar ranges them according. to the different types of emission, extracts from them the characteristics parameters and presents them in concise forrr, on an appropriate display. in the existing tcchniques, such a function comes about by resorting to the following procedure: for a certain number of emissions, known apriori, a certain number of jigital filters are predisposed for the afore seid parameters (cxcludis g the amplitude and the direction of origin as much as the emission is not identified), together with a time sequence of apertures in time, with the aim of considcring in the filter the period o@ repetition of the emission itself. in such a way it is possible to over cona ,he sequence of interlaced impulses, knowtl apriori, from the other received impulses. for the emissions riot known apriori, means are 1;ukell to trisualize eadi parameter on separate screens or else on bi-dimens onal screcns(gener ally anglc-frequcncy or else duration of impulse-angle). at this point an operator is able to pres ose an appropriate filter template in the aimensions of the screen coordinates, that isolates the desired sequence from the others and therefore allows for the measurement of the repetition period and the other characteristics at longer time intervals from the emission itself (cadence of rctation at the antenna and type of scanning) and also time tracking of the isolated emission. the disadvantages oi this system of extraction are that the atmosphere emissions are still noteworthy. in more, there is need for a full time operator who would otherwise concentrate on more important tasks such as tactical evaluations and countermeasures, also the use of an operator can only assure slow reaction to the variation of the electromagnetic environment and greatly increase the possibility of loosing short term emissions that are not known apriori. in order to overcome this inconvenience it is necessary that the function of "filter" of the emissions not knout apriori be made automatically and in a way that the reaction times be adequate. to obtain this result, a possible structure to realize is one that memorizes for a certain time the impulses received, it examines them and it associates them and then it refers itself to a successive group of impulses. this can be realized by means of two types of structure: one that works on a full memory (calculates when the memory is full) and one that works at the completion of time, elaborates, after a certain time
