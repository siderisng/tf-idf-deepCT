<ABSTRACT>
an aqueous emulsion comprising an organic isocyanate  and a surfactant which is the reaction product of an organic di  or polyisocyanate with   (1) an alkoxy polyethylene glycol of formula ro(ch₂ch₂o)nh  wherein r is an alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and n is at  least 5 and, optionally,   (2) an isocyanate-reactve compound having one or more  hydroxy, amino or carboxylic acid groups,   wherein the proportions of the said isocyanate-reactive com­ pound (2) are from 0 to 50 parts by weight of isocyanate-­ reactive compound per 100 parts by weight of akoxy  polyethylene glycol (1), and wherein the isocyanate function  of the organic di- or polyisocyanate is completely reacted with  the alkoxy polyethylene glycol and the isocyanate-reactive  compound (if used).  the emulsions are useful as adhesives, surface coatings  and especially as binders in the manufacture of chipboard.

<DESCRIPTION>
organic isocyanates are well known as binders, adhesives and surface coatings, for example in the manufacture of chipboard. organic isocyanates used for such purposes are generally too viscous to be readily applied as such and it has been found to be very effective to apply the organic isocyanate in the form of an aqueous emulsion. aqueous emulsions of organic isocyanates have previously been prepared which are stable in the sense that they do not readily separate into discrete layers of their main components. such emulsions1 however, are difficult to use for some applications as a result of degradation, for example by gelling by reaction of the water and the isocyanate to form a polyurea. this leads to a reduction in the time during which the emulsions remain workable, such time being referred to as the "pot life". stable emulsions of adequate "pot life" are described for example :n uk patent specification no.1444933 which discloses alueous emulsions containing a surface active agent of formula ro(ch ch o) conex wherein r is an alkyl group of 22n flzm 1 to 4 carbon atoms, n is an integer such that the compound contains an average of at least 5 oxyethylene grout and x is the residue of a di- or poly-isocyanate and ontains at least one free isocyanate group. surface active agents having free isocyanate grou s cannot be incorporated in the aqueous phase prior to emulsification, and indeed it has hitherto proved difficult to prepare stable isocyanate emulsions of adequate "pot life" when the surfactant is incorporated into the aqueous phase. in particular there is a need for a surface active agent whic is capable of being added to either the aqueous or the rganic phase. this versatility is also desirably accoipanied by the ability to formulate a family of such surface active agents whose emulsion-forming properties may be varied to suit specific emulsion formulations. according to the present invention there is provided an aqueous emulsion comprising an organic isocyanate and a surfactant which is the reaction product of an organic di- or polyisocyanate with (1) an alkoxy polyethylene glycol of formula ro(ch ch o) h 22n therein r is an alkyl group of i to 20 carbon atoms, and n is at least 5 and, optionally, (2) an isocyanate-reactive compound having one or more hydroxy, amino or carboxylic acid groups, wherein the proportions of the said isocyanate-reactive compound (2) are from 0 to 50 parts by weight of isocyanate-reactive compound per 100 parts by weight of alkoxy -polyethylene glycol (1), and wherein-dne isocyanate function of the organic di- or polyisocyanate is completely reacted with the alkoxy polyethylene glycol and the isocyanate-reactive compound (if used). the organic isocyanate which constitutes the aqueous emulsion and the organic di- or polyisocyanate which is reacted with the alkoxy polyethylene glycol and the isocyanate-reactive compound (if used) to form the surface active agent may be the same or different. the alkyl group r of the alkoxy polyethylene glycol ro(cei,ch,o) b contains from 1 to 20 carbon
