<ABSTRACT>
a control circuit (10) for the variable displacement pump  (18) of a hydrostatic transmission (16) or the like comprises an  underspeed actuator (31) connected to the servo system (19)  of the pump (18), a venturi (15) interconnected between a  source of pressurized working fluid (11) and the pump (18)  and a pressure regulating valve (36) interconnected between  a downstream side of the venturi (15) and the pump (18).  a  throat (29) and upstream side of the venturi (15) are connected  to the underspeed actuator (31) for communicating a differenÂ­ tial fluid pressure signal thereto to automatically control the  displacement of the the pump (18) under certain operating  conditions of an engine of a vehicle.  this invention is directed  to a bypass arrangement (39) interconnected between a  downstream side of the pressure regulating valve (36) and the  upstream side of the venturi (15) to closely control the fluid  pressure drop across the venturi (15) and to compensate for  changes in the temperature of the pressurized working fluid  passing through the venturi (15).
