<ABSTRACT>
upstanding polysurfaced male and female lips are  provided along confronting edges of adjacent elements,  such as building panels.  the female lip is engaged over the  male lip and when rotated about the male lip is snap-fitted  into interlocked relation therewith.  the lips provide an  upstanding joint which secures the adjacent elements in  fixed angular relation to each other.  the lips are interengaged  along plural angularly spaced-apart regions and are  overlapped such that vertical and lateral disengagement of  either lip relative to the other is precluded along the entire  length of the joint.
