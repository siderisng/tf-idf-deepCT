<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to prefabricated, self-supporting platen of at least two outer layers and an inherent of a foamed mixture consisting of a foamed mixture, as well as a method for their preparation, which are characterized in that the inner layer of unsaturated polyester resins, made of hollow beads of phylloalumosilicate with An average diameter of 150 microns and a density of 0.7 kg / DM3 and a functional, organic silan derivative, substantially vinylsilane and Metha cryylsilane, as a binder and granular, foamed materials, for example, pretreated flowering tone, beige mixed. The outer layer consists of a mixture of an unsaturated polyester resin with granite splinters and radio tional, organic silane derivatives, wherein the unsaturated thermester resins can be fire-proof and resistant to thermal expansion at high temperatures. The outer layer also contains short glass fibers and is reinforced with fiberglass material. At least a portion of the outer circumference of the plate may be provided by a frame which may have connecting means for other plates.
