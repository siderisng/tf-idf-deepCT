<ABSTRACT>
an automatic sample supply apparatus has a delivery  tube (2) which aspirates liquid samples from sample contain­ ers mounted on a turntable (3) and delivers the sample to the  dosing aperture of a graphite tube (1) of an atomic absorption  spectrophotometer or to the sample input of other analytical  instruments.  the turntable (3) also carries a flushing dis­ charge container (9) which is of similar form to the sample  container but has an aperture in the side wall.  when the turntable (3) is indexed so that the delivery tube  (2) enters the flushing discharge container (9) a solenoid valve  (11) is opened to allow a flushing liquid from container (10) to  flow through the tube (2) and into the container (9).  the aper­ ture in the wall of container (9) is dimensioned so that the  flushing liquid will only flow through it when a given head of  liquid exists above the top of the aperture.
