<ABSTRACT>
isoureas and isothioureas which are hiatamine h₂-­ antagonists and also have histamine h₁-antagonist activity  and antiinflammatory activity having the structure    in which r¹ and r² are hydrogen, lower alkyl, or together with  the carbon and two nitrogen atoms shown form a dihyd­ roimidazolyl or tetrahydropyrimidyl group, y is sulphur or  oxygen, n is from 3 to 8, x is oxygen or sulphur, z is hydrogen  or lower alkyl, a is c₁-c₅ alkylene or -(ch₂)pw(ch₂)q- where w  is oxygen or sulphur and the sum of p and q is 1 to 4, and b is  methyl, cycloalkyl, heteroaryl, aryl or, when a is alkylene,  hydrogen, are prepared by a process in which a compound of  structure    where d is hy- or a leaving group is reacted with:   (a) when d is hy-, an isothiourea    where a is lower alkyl or aryl (lower alkyl), or a cyanamide  r¹hncn or a carbodiimide r¹n = c = nr² or   (b) when d is a leaving group, a urea or thiourea    or, when y is oxygen a compound of structure    where g is a lower alkylthio, chlorine, bromine or no₂nh-, is  reacted with an isothiourea of structure
