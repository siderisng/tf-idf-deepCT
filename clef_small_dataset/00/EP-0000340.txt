<ABSTRACT>
In a device for fixing folding (63 to 66) on curtains or curtains (62) with vertically extending, up and down engaged webs, a introduced fold (64, 65) is clamped in a slot formed between two webs (54) . In order to keep the pre-protruding wrinkles safely and in their form exactly fixed, without having to be completely rigid in the fixation area in itself, an elastically with a support plate (1) lockable folding clip (2) is provided, which on its front ( 51) At least two wrapping clamping devices (52) mounted with each other by webs (54) is carried. In this case, at least one fold clamping device (52) jumps approximately as it corresponds to the depth of the folds to be fixed (63 to 66). The other fold clamping device jumps around a significantly small amount. The folding clip (2) is locked at the distance from the support plate (1) with this by means of arranged locking devices and has elastically deformable on both sides of these locking devices, with their outer longitudinal sides to the vicinity of the support plate ranging wings (72, 73), so that The outer folds (63, 66) between the support plate (1) and the wings (72, 73) are kept clamping.
