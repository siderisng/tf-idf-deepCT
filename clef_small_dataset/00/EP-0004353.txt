<ABSTRACT>
a non-water gelling alkylenoxy substituted castor oil, having at least one alkyleneoxy moiety represented as -(ch2ch2o)x(c3 or c4 alkyleneoxy constituent)yh wherein x is an integer of from 0 to about 45 and the total -(ch2ch2o) constituent is not more than about 90, and y is an integer of from about 0. 3 to about 10 and the total -(c3 or c4 alkyleneoxy constituent) is at least 1 and not more than about 30 is useful as a lubricant for textile materials.  such is accomplished by contacting the textile material with an aqueous admixture containing an effective amount of the alkyleneoxy substituted castor oil so as to provide from about 0. 5 to about 5 weight percent of the castor oil constituent on the textile material.
