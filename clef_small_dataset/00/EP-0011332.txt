<ABSTRACT>
the cold, hard water solubility of a dried instant tea is  improved when the dried instant tea is made from an aqueÂ­ ous based frigid fluid-to-plastic tea extract wherein said tea  extract is fast frozen to a brittle solid as fast as possible but at  least within 15 minutes from start of freezing, ground and  appropriately dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of making instant tea the present invention relates to a method of making instant tea and particularly concerns improving the cold, hard water solubility of soluble tea powders particularly suitable for use in iced beverages made with very hard tap water. it has been customary to prepare cold soluble tea powders or sediment-free concentrates suitable for use in iced beverages by making hot water extracts made of tea or fermented tea leaves and cooling the same to a temperature of approximately 4-100c to precipitate the cream", which is then removed from the supernatant liquid. alternatively, insoluble protein or other polyphenol adsorbants are added to the extracts in order to remove part of the oxidized polyphenols responsible for cream formation. the residual liquor is then concentrated to a syrup of desired consistency or dried to a powder. such processes suffer from the disadvantage that the sediment-free concentrate or dry powder yields a brew which does not reproduce the taste and strength associated with conventional black tea brew, because the cream or oxidized polyphenols removed in these processes are precisely the constituents which provide tea with its characteristic taste. such teas are therefore described as "flat". u.s. patent 4,004,038, january 18, 1977, to wickremaslnglle, discloses cold soluble tea concentrates and powders prepared by extracting tea leaves with hot water and selectively removing nonpolyphenolic, high molecular weight compounds from the tea extract while retaining the phenolic compounds therein and concentrating the resultant extract, u.s. patent z.@@ @@@@ and karas, april 4, 1951, discloses tne use of @hort chain polyphosphates te prepare a soluble tea concen- trate wherein the tea leaves are extracted with not water and polyphosphate is added to the aqueous ea extract to combine with substantially all of the calcium ions that wil.' be present in the final tea beverage. but the tea beverage made hy melzard et al. does not taste good due to the large amounts of the polyphosphate additives required to combine with the calcium ions present in most tap waters. like polyphosphates, sodium bisulfite is known in instant tea processing art to have certain advantages and disadvantages. in a process described by i. i. herz, u.s. patent 2,831,772, april 22, 1958, assigned to afico sa, a corporation of switzerland, it is used to make "a highly concentrated tea essence that readily dissolves in cold water" for making iced tea. the "method comprises: preparing a hot clear liquid tea essence from tea leaves... and dissolving in said aqueous tea essence an amount of a systemically innocuous sulfite to render soluble in cold water the ordinarily cold water insoluble fraction of the tea essence and concentrating....". while this patent teaches the use of bisulfite in hot tea extraction processes, resulting in cold water soluble tea products, many valuable tea aroma and flavor compounds are lost or destroyed. like the melzard et al. patent, the levels of additive (bisulfite) taught in herz adversely affect delicate tea flavor and aroma balance.. such processes remove and/or alter natural tea components. in

 claims 1. a method of   making    instant tea having improved cold water solubility characterized by fast freezing a frigid fluid-to-plastic tea extract to a brittle solid state within 15 minutes of initiation of said freezing, said frigid fluid-to-plastic tea extract having a tea solids content of from 8% to 45% by weight of said extract; grinding said brittle solid to a desirable particle size distribution   while    keeping said particles frozen solid, and appropriately drying said ground particles to provide said improved cold hard water soluble instant tea.   2. a method according to claim 1 characterized in that the fluid-to-plastic tea extract is prepared by;  (1) passing steam through a columnar bed of ground  tea leaves in such a manner so as to pre-wet  and pre-swell only an upper portion of said  ground tea leaves in said bed, said bed being  held at a temperature of below   650 c    and an  absolute pressure of 13 mbar to 400 mbar;  (2) slowly passing water and wet steam through said  bed in such a manner which avoids flooding of said  bed and thereby providing a moving interface  between wet swollen tea leaves and substantially  dry tea leaves until an initial aqueous tea  extract having a draw-off weight ratio of extract  to dry tea leaves of from 0.5:1 to 3: :1, said bed  being held at said temperature and said pressure  until one-half of said water and wet steam have  been applied, and then maintaining a temperature  in said bed below 72 c;  (3) collecting said initial aqueous tea extract in a  cold trap to provide a frigid fluid-to-plastic  tea extract, said initial aqueous tea extract  having a tea solids content of from 8% to   20tt       said cold trap being held at   an    asolt pressure  of 1 to 613 mbar and a temperature of from -180 c  to 20 c.    3. a method according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in  that said fast freezing of said frigid fluid-to-plastic tea extract to a solid is completed within 10 minutes of  initiation of freezing.    4. a method according to any preceding claim   charactexized     in that said fast frozen and freeze dried instant tea provides a stable   "cold,      hard    water-soluble instant tea, which upon reconstitution provides a substantially clear  tea beverage that tastes like a fresh expertly brewed tea  drink, said reconstituted tea beverage remaining substantially  soluble at iced tea temperatures.    5. a method according to claim 4 characterized in that when said fast frozen and freeze dried instant tea is put  into solution with a minimum amount of warm water and  diluted to beverage strength it provides a crystal clear  and solution stable iced tea.    6. a method according to any preceding claim characterized  in.that said frigid fluid-to-plastic tea extract is fast  frozen in layer sheets having a thickness of from 1 to 2  centimetres.     7. a method according to any preceding claim characterized  in that said cold ground particles are freeze dried or dried  by microwaves.    8. a method according to any preceding claim characterized  in that said fluid-to-plastic tea extract is fast   frozqn    in  a drum freezing apparatus or on a rotating cryogenic belt.    9. a method according to any preceding claim characterized  in that said tea extract is substantially a whole tea  extract which upon reconstitution comprises a tea chemical  composition substantially the same as that of freshly brewed  tea.      10.    a method according to any preceding claim characterized  in that said frigid fluid-to-plastic tea extract is appro  priately foamed before fast freezing.
