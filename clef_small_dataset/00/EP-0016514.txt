<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a collapsible cellular article car­ rier of the basket type for carrying bottles.  the carrier includes  a series of cells on either side of a longitudinal medial partition  (8, 9, 17, 19) which are separated by transverse partition struc­ tures (39:51, 40:52, 41:53, 42:54) including anchoring tabs  (59, 62, 65, 68).  in carriers of this type the anchoring tabs  sometimes are improperly glued because proper compres­ sion on these elements is difficult to achieve.  this invention  provides for the overlapping of adjacent anchoring tabs (62,  65: 59, 68) when the carrier is collapsed to achieve the desired  compression during fabrication of the carrier.
