<ABSTRACT>
a non-pneumatic bicycle tire of rubber, elastomeric, or  plastic type material, said tire having a uniform and circum­ ferentially disposed internal cavity terminating with annular  bead portions having outer annular bead cavities to engage  the internal portion of bicycle wheel rim edges, the improve­ ment wherein said tire is extruded and has annular retainer  means (14) positioned in a circumferential and centrally  located tread slot (16) having a depth greater than that of  said tread, said retainer means being the sole means to  secure said tire to said wheel rim.

<DESCRIPTION>
non-pneumatic bicycle tire related patents u.s. patent 1,169,984 is directed to a nonpneumatic elastic wheel tire for bicycles and automobiles. the tire is made of rubber or a rubber-like material and has an internal hollow space between the tire and the wheel rim on which it is placed; this space may be air filled or filled with, for example, a compressible elastic material. u.s. patent 956,928-discloses a pneumatic tire with a ring member positioned in the outer central groove of a tread band, the latter being held to the intermediate tire portion ("cover") by compression; this tread band is interchangeable. u.s. patent 4,127,166 is directed to a molded non-pneumatic bicycle tire made from a urethane elastomer; this tire is one requiring the use of a bonding cement for bonding the tire to the wheel rim. u.s. patent 1,434,742 discloses solid tire retaining means for wheels; said tire is one which has a central wire core member (s5) as shown in fig. 3; it is identified in column 2 as the "usual wire 15 which extends entirely around the tire." u.s. patent 3,126,040, is directed to a pneumatic tire with anti-skid elements anchored to the center tread portion by means of a pair of inextensible tread rings. u.s. patent 2,996,040 is directed to a high speed pneumatic tire wherein undesirable movement of portions of the tire tread, sidewall and body is prevented by a constricting annular member extending, in a slot therefore, circumferentially about the center portion of the tire tread. an effective constricting member is disclosed to be one from plies produced by winding continuous twisted wire cord into generally parallel convolutions and surrounding the wire with a rubbery substance, followed by vulcanization to unit the wires, the rubbery substance and the tire into a unit. background of the invention heretofore, pneumatic bicycle tires have been made of several components, fabric plies, tread, sidewalls and rim beads. the components are assembled manually on a special tire building machine and subsequently vulcanized in a curing press. the completed tire is mounted on a bicycle wheel rim and inflated by an inner tube that secures the tire on the rim. a malfunction of any one component causes tire failure. this known tire construction method is relatively expensive, particularly in terms of labor and equipment; in addition, tire andlor tube repair requires a skilled pair of hands. adequate pressure must be maintained in the tire. description of the invention any appropriate, rubber, elastomer, plastic or blend thereof capable of being extruded through a conventional extruder and die can be utilized to produce my uniquely designed bicycle tire which is non-pneumatic. my tire can be cut to measurement from a roll thereof and its design eliminates the need for adhesive bonding and/or splicing of the ends. furthermore, adhesive bonding to the wheel rim is not needed as i achieve a friction fit there, and where the cut ends meet. the tread slot of controlled depth is the key feature of my unique tire design;
