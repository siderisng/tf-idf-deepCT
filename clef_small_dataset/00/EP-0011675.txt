<ABSTRACT>
a pulling guide (10) for blades consisting of two in cross-section U-shaped rails (18 and 26) at different heights of its pegs (20 and 24), which engage with successive U-legs (22 or 28) in one in one . between the outer sides of the U-leg (28) of the running rail (26) lower web height and the inside of the U-leg (22) of the running rail (18) greater web heights are arranged by a cage (32) supported balls (30) which in In the U-legs (28; 22) formed ball rollers. The cage (32) has a web portion (38) into the spaces between the U-legs (22; 28) of the run (18; 26) protruding legs (36) in which the balls (30) holding openings ( 34) are provided. The web portion (38) is at least a front end with an elastically deformable tongue portion (44) in the maximum pull-out position at least partially over the end of the fixed furniture part (14) fastened running rail (26) with at least one in the direction of the extendable furniture part ( 12) for attached running rail (18) protruding locking rate (58; 60), wherein in the locking force (58; 60) in the maximum pull-out position opposite the area of ​​the race rail (18) to be removed at the eliminated furniture part (12), a residual opening (62 ; 64) is provided in which the locking rate (58; 60) is latched by elastic forming of the tongue portion (44). In the elastically deformable region of the tongue portion (44), a cooperating counter stop (76) of the cage (32) is composed with the end stop (72) on the furniture fixed running rail (26), which is dimensioned that it is in deformation of the tongue portion (44) into the handle position of the locking set (58; 60) in the locking opening (62; 64) from its stop position to the extent that it can be overwhelfast from the end stop (72) of the furniture-resistant running rail (26).
