<ABSTRACT>
the processing of image-wise exposed radiation sensitive  devices such as radiation sensitive plates for lithographic  printing plate production is effected by contacting the  devices with developer liquid and optionally subjecting the  devices to an overall exposure to actinic radiation prior to  or during contact with the developer liquid.  in order to  compensate for the affects of temperature variation of the  developer liquid, a temperature sensitive member (5) is  immersed in the developer liquid.  the member produces  an output signal in dependence on the temperature of the  developer liquid.  this signal is used to control the degree  to which the device is processed in a manner dependent  on the temperature of the developer liquid for example by  controlling the duration of contact of the device and the  developer liquid, by controlling the degree to which the  developer liquid is agitated in contact with the device, or  by controlling the degree to which the device is subjected  to the overall exposure to radiation.
