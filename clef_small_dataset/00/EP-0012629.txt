<ABSTRACT>
an electrical reactor has a core (11), for example com­ posed of silicon steel plates, forming a closed magnetic cir­ cuit including a gap (14).  a by-pass member (20) across the  gap (14) forms a magnetic by-pass path around the gap (14).   the by-pass member (14) may be a silicon steel plate with its  plane parallel to the plane of the plates forming the core.  a  coil (15, 17, 18) is wound on the core (11).  the inductance of the reactor depends upon magnetic  saturation of the by-pass member (20).  when current in the  coil is small reactor inductance is large because the by-pass  member (20) does not saturate, but when current in the coil is  large the by-pass member (20) saturates and reactor induc­ tance is reduced.  the reactor can be employed for blocking leakage of  noise generated at the time of commutation in a thyristor  controlled converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
electrical reactors the present invention relates to electrical reactors. electrical reactors are employed for example for preventing leakage of noise generated during commutation in a thyristor-controlled converter. the speed of a dc motor can be varied by changing voltage applied thereto, and reversal of the polarity of the applied voltage can cause the motor to operate in a reverse direction. to decrease motor speed over a short period of time a braking current is caused to flow into the motor armature by allowing the armature voltage to exceed the applied voltage. to provide appropriate applied voltages for motor speed and direction control, a thyristor-controlled three-phase full-wave reversible bridge is ordinarily employed for driving a dc motor which is required to rotate at a variety of speeds and in both forward and reverse directions. such a thyristor-controlled threephase full-wave reversible bridge is constructed by connecting two oppositely poled thyristor-controlled converters in parallel with one another, one of which converters is a forward or "positive" converter for supplying the armature of the dc motor with a forward current, and the other of which converters is a reverse or "negative" converter for passing a reverse current through the armature. each of the positive and negative converters is connected in parallel with the armature of the motor and comprises six thyristors. the dc motor can be made to rotate in the forward direction at a prescribed speed by firing each thyristor in the positive converter at a suitable timing to allow this converter to supply the armature with a forward current, whereas the motor can be made to rotate in the reverse direction at a prescribed speed by firing each thyristor in the negative converter at a suitable timing to allow this converter to supply the armature with a reverse current a rapid reduction in the speed of the motor can be achieved when a braking current is passed through the armature by changing the operating mode of the converters from a power rectification mode to a power inversion mode. in a thyristor-controlled three-phase full-wave reversible bridge as described above a commutation overlap phenomenon occurring at the time of thyristor commutation can give rise to a large overshoot in phase current when a phase current begins to flow into a fired thyristor or when a phase current is narrowed or reduced to zero in a thyristor which is to be turned off. this overlap phenomenon can also cause excessive overshoot pulses to be superimposed on phase voltage on the input side of the thyristor-controlled threephase full-wave reversible bridge. these pulses superimposed on the phase current and phase voltage have a steep rate of change and can therefore be a source of a great quantity of noise which can be transmitted from the thyristor-controlled three-phase full-wave reversible bridge to an external point via an input line and which can then "leak" into associated circuitry such as a phase control circuit for controlling the firing of the thyristors. ordinarily, a phase control circuit is designed such
