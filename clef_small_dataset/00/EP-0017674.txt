<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for forming a twist knot in the ends (7) of  wire (2) passing around a bundle (1) of rods or a large  bundle of smaller bundles of rods has a head (3) which is  rotatable about an axis (9) and carries a pair of arms (4)  which are pivotable towards and away from the axis (9).   the arms (4) have slots (6) to receive and hold the wire  ends (7) so that when the head is rotated the ends are  twisted together into a knot.  to provide a simple mechanism avoiding the need for  control of the movement of the arms and to render the ap­ paratus versatile, the arms (4) are substantially freely mov­ able about their pivots (5), so that they are pulled inwardly  by the wire ends themselves, during the initial period of  rotation of the head.

<DESCRIPTION>
1?apparatus for twisting together the end portions of wire around a bundle" this invention relates to apparatus for twisting together the end portions of wire around a bundle, so as to form a twist knot securing the wire, comprising a rotatable head, means for rotating the head about an axis, and a pair of arms each having a first end pivotally mounted on said head so that the second end is movable towards and away from said axis, there being a slot in said second end of each arm to receive the wire, wherein said slots respectively receive the ends of the wire in the open position of said arms and said arms are closed together as the head is rotated so as to twist the ends of the wire together. bundling machinery is used in rod and wire mills. there is small bundling equipment for bamdlin-, a number of rods, toeer with a countin device for rocs and so called large bundling equipment for bundling a number of small bundles of rods, together with a counting device for the small bundles. to secure the bundles, wire lengths are passed circumferentially around them, and are knotted at the free ends. this knotting operation is at the present time usually performed manually; it is strenuous work and, with for instance wire or 5nm diameter, means that the wire must previously be annealed in order to render it soft enough to be manipulated. the annealing of the wire increases its cost. proposals for knotting machines have been made. see french patent specification 1 32ci 164 where two åaaws grip the wire ends in the manner of pincers and twist them together. see also german patent specification no. 310 265 which discloses apparatus as described in the first paragraph above. in this apparatus, the pivoted arms are moved, in their open position, so as to embrace the bundle with their ends projection beyond the bundle whereupon a straight and already cut length of wire is passed through the specially shaped slots in the ends of the arms. the arms are then withdrawn past the bundle so that the wire is bent and lies alongside three sides of the bundle, then the arms are pivoted so that their ends move together to bring the wire ends together, this being a positive action effected by moving guide slots acting on pins on the arms, and the head carrying the arms is rotated to through 100 to twist the wire ends round each other. this previously proposed apparatus has two particular disadvantages. firstly, it is complicated, since complex means for controlling the movement of the arms is necessary. secondly, automatic adaptation to different bundle sizes is not possible, because the wire is cut to length before being wrapped around the bundle. the present invention has as its object the simplification of the apparatus, and also to provide means for forming a knot which is independent of the means for wrapping the wire around the bundle. the

claims    1. apparatus for twisting together the end portions (7) of   wire    (2) around a bundle (1) so as to form a twist knot securing the wire, comprising a rotatable head (3) means for rotating the head about an axis   (9)    and a pair of arms (4) each having a first end pivotally mounted (5) on said head (4) so that the second end is movable towards and away from said axis, there being a slot (6) in said second end of each arm to receive the wire, wherein said slots respectively receive the ends of the wire in the open position of said arms and said arms are closed together as the head is rotated so as to twist the ends of the   ire    together,  characterised in that said arms are pivotally mounted so as to be capable of free uncontrolled movement inwardly towards the axis (9) whereby the arms are pulled inwardly by the wire when the head rotates to form the knot.     2. apparatus accordin to claim 1 characterised in that the arms (4) are freely pivoted on horizontal axes and are biassed outwardly by gravity.    apparatus according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in that there are provided means for drawing the wire around the bundle from a continuous   stock    of wire and means for cutting off the length of wire extendin around the bundle after the wire has been drawn.      4. apparatus according to claims 1 to 3 characterised in that in their closed position the arms (100,101) provide a central space (112) which is preferably cylindrical and in which the knot is formed.    5. apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that an axially extending spigot (111) is located in said central space (112) the knot being formed by winding the end positions of the wire around the spigot (111).
