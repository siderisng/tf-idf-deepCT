<ABSTRACT>
a method of manufacturing structural honeycomb  with superior insulation effectiveness, by the incorporation  of integral heat radiation shields into the current process  of manufacturing honeycomb hexagonal cells as formed  by expanding a block of flat laminations.  the heat radiation  shields are initially in the form of flat ribbons (4) of thin  low emissivity metal coated plastic film, which are bonded  between each lamination, in a direction normal to either  the adhesive lines, strips on stripes (2), or unmasked  stripes, strips, or lines, used to bond the honeycomb nodes.   the ribbons (4) are formed of compressed pleats, which  open up when the flat laminated block is expanded, closing  off each hexagonal cell with spaced heat radiation shields  (6).
