<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to herbicidal means characterized by a content of ethyl-n-ethyl-n bicyclo- [2. 2. 1] Hep-2-yl thiolcarbamate of the formula as herbicine active ingredient and at least one halogenacy lamide of formula I in the R is an unbranched or branched haloalkyl radical of up to 3 carbon atoms and R¹ and R² are the same or different and a branches or branched alkyl radical with up to 6 kOH of pfalstoff atoms, which may be by an alkoxy group with up to 4 carbon atoms or a cyano group substitui, a cycloalkyl radical having 3 to 6 carbon atoms or unbranched or branched alkenyl or alkinyl radicals with up to 4 carbon tons or R¹ and R² together with the nitrogen atom whose sub stutures they are a 4- to 9-membered, saturated mono- or bicyclic ring, which can be simply or multiplically substituted by unbranched or branched alkyl radicals with up to 4 carbon sato men, or form a tetrahydro-1,3-oxazine ring of the formula, in the R³, R⁴, R⁵, R⁶ and R⁷ are equal or different or a unbranched or branched alkyl radical with up to 3 carbon atoms, R⁸ hydrogen or unbranched or branched alkyl radical with up to 8 carbon atoms, R⁹ hydrogen, an unbranched or branched alkyl radical having up to 8 carbon atoms an alkoxy alkyl radical With up to 6 carbon atoms or a dialkoxyalkyl radical of up to 8 carbon atoms, and R⁸ and R⁹ together can form a methylene chain with 4 or 5 KOH of lenr substance atoms, as an antagonistic agent. The proportion ratio ethyl-n-ethyl-n-bicyclo [2. 2. 1] HETT-2-YL-thiolcarbamate: Antagonistic agent is 1: 1 to 1: 0.01 parts by weight in common or separate outrage.
