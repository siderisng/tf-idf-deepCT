<ABSTRACT>
In a hairdryer, the hollow column-shaped electrical radiator (7.22) is arranged out around the electric motor (4, 19) for the fan wheel (20). In order to achieve a uniform temperature distribution in the air from the air from the lowest manufacturing cost, the lateral surface of the support body (8, 25; 41, 42, 43) for the hot zwendelel (10, 44) with groups of slots (9) is provided, which are arranged over the circumference distributed on a helical line, wherein the heat coil (10, 44) wound around the hollow column-shaped support body extends tendonally through the inner contour of the radiator. In order to enable a good overflow of the radiator, the radiator is held in the device housing (1) between lattices (11, 12; 23, 24), wherein the carrying grids simultaneously serve the holder of the engine. The hollow column-shaped slitting support bodies (8, 25; 41, 42, 43) may have both a cylindrical and a prismatic shape. The support body is bent out of a planes of the slots (9) having Mekanitstreifen to a hollow ou-shaped body, the ends of the mecanite stripes are riveted together. The wiping of the support body with the heating coil can be done both before, as well as after bending.
