<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to novel mercapto substi tuted-2, 3,4, 5-tetrahydro-lh-3-benzazepines having pharmacodynamic activity. more specifically the compounds of this invention have dopamine receptor blocking activity and therefore are useful as antipsychotic and antiemetic agents. the antipsychotic activity is similar to that of chlorpromazine. the compounds of this invention are represented by the following general structural formula: emi1.1 formula i wherein: r represents methyl, allyl, dimethylallyl, phenethyl, cyclopropylmethyl or b-hydroxyethyl; r1 represents phenyl, m- or p-substituted phenyl with the substituent being trifluqroadthyl, chloro, methoxy, methyl, fluoro, nitro or hydroxy, cyclohexyl, thienyl, thienylmethyl, furyl or furylmethyl; r2 represents hydrogen, methoxy, alkanoyloxy with the alkanoyl moiety having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or hydroxy, each r2 being the same or different except that when one of r2 is alkanoyloxy the other is hydrogen, methoxy or alkanoyloxy; and r3 represents hydrogen, chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl, fluoro or methyl. particular compounds of this invention represented by formula i above are when r is methyl, r1 is phenyl, p-trifluoromethylphenyl, p-chlorophenyl, p-tolyl, p-fluorophenyl, cyclohexyl or 2-thienyl, both r2 are hydrogen, acetoxy or hydroxy, or- one r2 is hydroxy and the other is methoxy, and r3 is hydrogen, chloro or bromo. the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts having the utility of the free bases of formula i, prepared by methods well known to the art, are formed with both inorganic or organic acids, for example: maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, bismethylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, oxalic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itdconic, glycolic, p'aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, cyclohexylsulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids. u. s. patents 3,671,519 and 3,483,185 name "2,3,4 ,5-tetrahydro-8-methylmercapto-lh-3-benzazepine" as a starting material, however neither of these or equivalent prior art discloses the mercapto substituents of formula i above in a 3-benzazepine series. the compounds of formula i wherein both r2 are hydroxy are conveniently prepared from dihydroxy substituted benzazepines as shown in the following scheme: emi2.1 in which r1 is as described above (except for hydroxy substituted phenyl). thus, a 7,8-dihydroxy substituted benzazepine is oxidized, preferably with 2,3-dichloro-5,6dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (ddq) in an inert organic solvent in which the reactants are soluble such as methanol or ethanol, with chilling at about 0-50c. or at ambient temperature until the oxidation is complete. a number of other mild oxidizing agents known to convert catechols to o-quinones may be employed such as, for example, silver oxide, ceric ammonium nitrate, chloranil or silver carbonate. the 7,8-dione intermediate is then reacted with the desired mercaptan (r1sh) in a suitable inert organic solvent such as an alcoholic solvent, methanol or ethanol, at about ambient temperature to give the mercapto substituted product. the hydroxy substituted phenyl products are conveniently obtained from the corresponding methoxy substituted phenyl compounds by treatment with, for example, boron tribromide. alternatively the above dihydroxy substituted benzazepine starting material, or its dimethyl ether derivative, is brominated to give the 6-bromo compound which is reacted with n-butyl lithium and then an appropriate disulfide to give the 6-thio substituted product. the ether groups can be cleaved to hydroxy
