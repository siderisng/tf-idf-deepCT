<ABSTRACT>
a track rod end having a head portion (12) an a stem por­ tion (14) is initially produced as a drop forged blank such that  the length of the stem portion is less than the desired length in  the finished article and the diameter of the stem portion (14) is  greater than the desired finished diameter.  the drop forge  blank is then subjected to a hydraulic forming operation which  causes elongation of the stem portion (14) to the desired  length and reduction of its diameter to the desired diameter.   thereafter, the head (12) may be machined to the desired con­ figuration and the stem portion (14) may be provided with a  screwthread by means of the thread rolling technique.  this  method reduces the amount of material required for the pro­ duction of a track rod end, the extrusion step and hence the  mechanical working of the stem portion (14) increases its ten­ sile strength and the cylindrically formed stem portion (14) cre­ ated by extrusion facilitates mounting of the track rod end for  subsequent machining of the head (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
description manufacture of truck rod funds this invention relates to the manufacture of track rod ends for motor vehicle steering systems. track rod ends are conventionally manufactured by initially producing a drop forged blank comprising a head portion and a stem portion, the head portion is machined to forn a generally cylindrical section recess for receiption of a ball joint coupling and thereafter the stem is machined to a cylindrical form in which a screw thread is then machined. the head portion is machined before the stem portion so that the machined recess can be used to mount the rod end for subsequent machining of the stern. the object of the present invention are to enable track rod ends to be manufacture ore efficiently and economically. according to the present invention we provide a method of manufacturing a track rod end having a head portion and a stem portion, the stem portion having a predetermined length and a generally cylindrical portion of predetermined dimension, said method including the steps of producing a blank having a head portion and a ster portion whose length is shorter than said predetermined length and whose cross-sectional dimension is larger than said predetermined dimension, and subjecting the stem portion to a mechanical working operation which reduces the cross section of the stem to generally cylindrical form of said predeterr,lined dimension while elongating the same to said predeterr; ;lined length. thus instead of removing the material from the stein portion in order to reduce it to the required size, in accordance with the present invention the stern portion can be mechanically reduced to the required size without removal of material by machining and at the same time it is elongated to the required size as a result of the reducing operation. a considerable saviny in the quantity of material used for the manufacture of the track rod end is therefore possible. moreover, by mechanically working the stem portion to reduce its cross-section without removing material, the tensile strength of the material is increased. preferably the mechanical reducing stroke elongation step is carried out prior to machining of the head. thus, the track rod ends may be mounted and properly located by means of their cylindrical stem portions during this machining step and this can be accomplished more easily than is the case when the head portion is used to mount and locate the track rod end. using the stem portion to mount and locate the rod end is not practical with the conventional method because the screw thread forming step is carried out imllediatelv after the stem portion has been machined to cylindrical form and the screw thread could be damaged if the stem portion is subsequently used to ount the rod end during machining of the head portion. in acccrdance with the preferred feature of the invention, the screw thread is forged on the cylindrical stem portion by the thread rolling technique. the reducing elongation step is preferably carried out by forcing the sten portion
