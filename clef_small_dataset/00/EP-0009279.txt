<ABSTRACT>
a system for conveying and storing newly pressed  cheeses (6), comprising a plurality of shelves made as  conveyor units each comprising a row of crosswise dispo­ sed carrier bars (24, 28), of which some are cyclically mo­ vable so as to cause the cheeses (6) to be displaceable  along the shelf structure.  the cheeses (6) may thus be fed  to and moved away from respective storing positions on  the shelves by the conveyor action of the shelves themsel­ ves, and during the storing whether in air or in a liquid the  cheeses (6) may be slowly reciprocated to avoid surface  deformation thereof and allow free access to all surface  portions thereof.  when used in combination with a brine  vat (2) the conveyor shelves will support the underlying  cheeses (6) because of their buoyancy in the brine, but the  cyclically movable bars (28) act as a conveying means on  both the top side and the underside of the shelf, to enable  reciprocation even of cheeses (6) submerged in brine.
