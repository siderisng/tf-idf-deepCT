<ABSTRACT>
in a method for maintaining the concentration of at least one liquid development-active substance in a liquid developer solution in particular for a developing process using the semi-wet method for diazo type sheet material, the concentration of the substance is determined simply but accurately by measuring the viscosity of the developer solution and if necessary a further quantity of the substance is metered into the developer solution as a function of the measured value.  an apparatus operating by this method contains as viscosity sensor a rotation body (2) which is driven by an electric motor (6) and which is arranged in a liquid-permeable housing (3) close to the inner surface thereof.  a measuring resistor (11) arranged in a current supply line (7) leading to the electric motor communicates via a discriminator (14) with a metering means (16-18) for the development- active substance.  <image>
