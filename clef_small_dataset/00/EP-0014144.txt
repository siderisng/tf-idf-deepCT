<ABSTRACT>
the arched supporting structure or skeleton is constructed by juxtaposing at least two polygonal rows consisting of successive identical elements (10), the polygons of two adjacent rows being offset angularly in order to form an outer profile substantially in the shape of a regular star.  fixing means (11) are provided in order to interlink the adjacent ends of two successive elements of the same row (b, c) and for fastening to an associated element (a) of the adjacent row subtending these two jointed elements.  the connector (11) additionally comprises a receptacle (15, 15') for mounting secondary boom elements (5').  in another embodiment, the successive elements of two adjacent rows are alternately interlaced.  <image>
