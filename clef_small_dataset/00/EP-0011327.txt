<ABSTRACT>
aerosolization of wastewater such as occurs in the flushing  of toilets and in sewage treatment, is minimized by addition  of from about 1 to about 30 ppm of high molecular  weight poly(ethylene) oxide polymers into said wastewater.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of reducing aerosolization of liastewater technical field the present invention relates to the treatment of wastewater which contains human waste, so as to reduce the aerosolization which can occur when said wastewater is subjected to turbulence, as for example, in the flushing of toilets or in secondary sewage treatment facilities. this is accomplished by incorporating into the wastewater from about 1 ppm to about 30 ppm of a water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) polymer having a molecular weight of about 100,000 to about 7,000,000. background art the agitation of aqueous systems which contain mios produces aerosol particles which contain the ti- crobes. aerosol particles, as commonly designated, include the true aerosol particles of from a few millimicrons to about 1 micron in diameter, and larger particles which can have diameters of more than 100 microns. (see encyclopaedia britainnica, micropaedia, vol. i, page 114, 15th ed., 1975) these aerosol particles, are forcefully ejected from the aqueous system by agitation and can be subsequently carried by air currents, whereupon they can enter the human body through respiration or through hand-to-mouth contact with surfaces upon which the particles eventually settle. baylor et al., science, 198, pp. 575-580, november 1977 report that virus is transferred from sea water into the surrounding air by aerosolization from the surf, and that the concentration of virus in the aerosol is greater than in the main body of sea water. they indicate that this has public health implications in regions where sewage is dumped into coastal waters. gerba et al. in applied microbiology 30,2:pp. 229-237 (1975) describe a study in which it was found that bacteria and virus seeded into toilet bowls appeared in aerosol droplets produced by the toilet during flus()#}i#,i 3w? that these droplets remained airborne long enough to settle on surfaces throughout the bathroom. from the foregoing it is apparent that a reduction in aerosolization from wastewater containing human waste is desirable as a means of reducing the potential for disease transmission from said wastewater. it is an object of the present invention to reduce the potential for disease transmission from wastewater by incorporating into said wastewater a material which reduces the tendency of the wastewater to form aerosol particles when subjected to turbulence. it is a further object of the invention to reduce the potential for disease transmission from flushing toilets by dispensing into the flush water an agent which reduces aerosolization it is a further object of the invention to reduce the potential for disease transmission from aerated or agitated sewage treatment processes by incorporating an agent which reduces aerosolization into the wastewater which is treated by such processes. the attainment of these and other objects will be apparent from the following description. disclosure of invention in accordance with the present invention, the incorporation of levels of from about 1 ppm to about 30 ppm (preferably from about 3 to about 15 ppm) of high molecular weight, water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) resins into wastewater significantly reduces the tendency of the wastewater to aerosolize when subjected
