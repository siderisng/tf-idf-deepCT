<ABSTRACT>
a cardiac pacemaker including implantable housing  means (8), electrical signal generating means enclosed  within said housing, an electrode conductor (6) for conveying  pacing signals to the heart, and apparatus for maintaining  sealable electrical interconnection between said generating  means and said electrode.  said apparatus comprises a  pair of terminal means (2,4) which cooperate through  engageable camming surfaces (16,32) to clamp the lead between  lead clamping jaws on a collet (20).  the pacemaker  housing may be bifurcated, with one portion containing the  interconnection apparatus, and the other containing the  pacemaker electronics and batteries.  the two portions are  assembled separately and subsequently combined structurally  and electrically.  one of the terminal means (4) is provided  with appropriate slots (40) to engage protuberances  from a spanner, thereby facilitating quick and accurate insertion  or removal of the electrode conductor.
