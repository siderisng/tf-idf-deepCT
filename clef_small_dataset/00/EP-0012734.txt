<ABSTRACT>
a device for taking from a flowing suspension a sam­ ple-flow representative of said suspension comprises a first  chamber (18) arranged to reveive the flowing suspension,  said first chamber communicating via a weir (23) with the  upper part of a second chamber (22) having first and second  openings (25, 26) arranged at the bottom thereof for remov­ ing the sample-flow and the remaining part of said suspen­ sion respectively.  the openings (25, 26) are separated from  each other by partition walls (27) which extend transverseiy  of the weir over the whole lenght of the second chamber  and communicate with a respective outlet (15, 20; 21).  the  openings (26) for receiving the said remaining part of the  suspension communicate with the associated outlet (21) via  a substantially u-shaped passage and a second weir (29)  which is located substantially on the same level as the weir  (23) of the first chamber.  in order to prevent blockage of the  u-shaped passage while maintaining requisite precision of  the device, at least one of said partition walls (27) exhibits  means for maintaining communication between said u-­ shaped passage and the sample-flow outlet (15, 20) in a  region located beneath the uppermost level (33) of the  connection (30) between the two legs of the u-shaped  passage.
