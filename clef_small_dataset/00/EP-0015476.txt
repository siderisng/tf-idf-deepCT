<ABSTRACT>
a method of oxidizing organic compounds, such as 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene,  in an aqueous system of ph not more than  about 4, by contacting the compound with an oxidizing agent,  such as air, in the presence of a catalyst, said catalyst comprising  a combination of (a) nitrate ions, (b) at least one of either  bromide ions or iodide ions, and (c) transition metal ions of at  least one transition metal having two or more oxidation states,  such as vanadium ions.  this catalyst enhances the rate of oxidation  of the organic compounds.
