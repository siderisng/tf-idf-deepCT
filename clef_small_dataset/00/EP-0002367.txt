<ABSTRACT>
in a terminated flat flexible electrical cable assembly  including a cable (1) comprising a plurality of spaced parallel  conductors (2) embedded in a sheet of electrically insulating  material, and an electrical connector comprising a housing  (19, 20) of electrically insulating material carrying a plurality  of signal conductor terminals (7a, 17) connected to individual  signal conductors (2a) of the cable, and carrying a commoning  conductive strip (8) to which a plurality of ground  conductors (2b) of the cable are connected, the commoning  strip (8) being formed with a plurality of apertures (9) each  constituting a means of connection to an individual ground  conductor (2b) of the cable, the ground conductors (2b) to be  connected to the commoning strip (8) are formed with loop  portions (4) pushed out of the plane of the cable (1) which  loop portions (4) are received in the apertures (9) in the  commoning strip (8) thereby to establish electrical connections  between the ground conductors (2b) and the commoning  strip (8).
