<ABSTRACT>
Chuck for lathes with clamping jaws (2) made of an axially front baking portion (2a) and an axially rear baking portion (2b), each guided radially adjustable in the feed body (1). The rear baking portion (2b) is on the one hand with a drive member (4, 5) for the jaw adjustment, on the other hand with the front baking portion (2a) by an outwardly actuated coupling piece (16) engaged in the rear baking portion (2b). Therefore, for a change in the clamping diameter, the front baking portion (2a) can be adjusted relative to the rear baking portion (2b) without having its connection to the drive member (4, 5) must be released. If the coupling pieces (16) are not in the fully engaged coupling state, the clamping movement is locked automatically. For this purpose, each coupling piece (16) is rotatable about an axis (14) vertical axis (14) perpendicular to the feed axis (9) with clutch protrusions (13), depending on the rotational position of the coupling piece (16) with the front baking portion (2a) radially in the Avoltage or release it for radial displacement. For each clamping jaw (2), a locking member (17) adjustable by the associated coupling piece (16) is provided, the not or not completely engaged clutch state of the coupling piece (16) either this against radial adjustments or the drive member (4, 5) against axial adjustments in Feed body (1) locks.
