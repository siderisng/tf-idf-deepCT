<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for removing of a tube  bundle from an opened-top vertical cylindrical shell of  a steam generator, on which a cask (37) is placed with a  tube-bundle-lifting crane (48) at its upper end.  the tube  bundle (23) is lifted into the cask (37) after such bundle  (23) has been separated from the generator's tubesheet,  the cask (37) which consists of multiple longitudinal sections  (39) interconnected by removable means is then lifted  from the shell (3) to a nearby site, a lower portion of  said tube bundle (23) is cut off for disposition within the  lowermost longitudinal section of said cask (37), the  remaining tube-bundle-containing cask sections (39) are  lifted free of the lowermost cask section which is closed  by a respective new bottom cover.  the cutoff and lifting  steps are repeated until the entire tube bundle is disposed  in respective longitudinal sections of said cask, which are  removed from the reactor containment with the cut tube  bundle portions enclosed therein.
