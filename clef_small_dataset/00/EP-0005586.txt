<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a novel 2,4,6-tris-(substituted-amino)-s-triazines  which are useful in medicine, more  especially as anti-inflammatory agents and as inhibitors of  the progressive joint deterioration characteristic of arthritic  disease.  the compounds of the invention may be represented  by the formula:    or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition or quaternary  ammonium salt thereof; wherein r₁ is alkylamino having  from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, l-adamantyl-amino,  2-adamantylamino, exo [2. 2. 1] norbornylamino, endo-[2. 2. 1]  norbornylamino, 3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 1. ] octyl, 1,8,8-trimethyl-3-azabicyclo  [3. 2. 1] octyl, 3-azabicyclo [3. 3. 1] -nonyl, 9-azabicyclo  [3. 3. 1] nonyl, 2-azabicyclo [3. 2. 2] -nonyl, 3-azabicyclo  [3. 2. 2] -nonyl or endo-3-hydroxy-8-azabicyclo  [3. 2. 1] oct-8-yl; r₂ is l-adamantylamino, 2-adamantylamino,  exo [2. 2. 1] norbornylamino, endo- [2. 2. 1] norbornylamino,  3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 1] octyl, 1,8,8-trimenthyl-3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 1]  octyl, 3-azabicyclo [3. 3. 1] -nonyl, 9-azabicyclo [3. 3. 1] nonyl,  2-azabicyclo [3. 2. 2] -nonyl, 3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 2] nonyl or  endo-3-hydroxy-8-azabicyclo [3. 2. 1] oct-8-yl; r₃ is hydrogen  or alkyl having up to 4 carbon atoms; r₄ is 2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl,  alkyl having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, phenyl,  monohalo(f, cl, br)phenyl, 1-adamantyl, 2-adamantyl, exo[2. 2. 1]norbornyl,  endo[2. 2. 1]norbornyl or a monovalent  moiety of the formula:    wherein q is a divalent moiety of the formulae:    r₅ is alkyl having up to 4 carbon atoms, r₆ is alkyl having up  to 4 carbon atoms or r₅ and r₆ taken together with their  associated n(itrogen) is piperidino, morpholino, pyrrolidino  or thiomorpholino; with the proviso that when r₄ is alkyl,  adamantyl or norbornyl then r₃ must be hydrogen; or r₃ and  r₄ taken together with their associated n(itrogen) is 3-azabicyclo  [3. 2. 1] -octyl, 1,8,8-trimethyl-3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 1]  cotyl, 3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 1] nonyl, 9-azabicyclo [3. 3. 1] nonyl,  2-azabicyclo [3. 2. 2] nonyl, 3-azabicyclo [3. 2. 2] nonyl, endo-3-hydroxy-8-azabicyclo  [3. 2. 1] oct-8-yl, pyrrolidino, piperidino,  hexamethyleneimino, heptamethyleneimino or a monovalent  moiety of the formula:    wherein r is hydrogen, alkyl having up to 4 carbon atoms,  phenyl, p-methoxyphenyl or carboalkoxy having up to 4  carbon atoms.
