<ABSTRACT>
a control unit braking apparatus has a housing (6) in  which a shaft (4) is rotatably supported and is capable of  axial movement, has one end of the shaft (4) projecting  from the housing (6) and connected to a control member  (40).  the braking apparatus incorporates a friction member  (24) mounted on the end of the shaft (4) and urged by a  spring (20) positioned between the housing (6) and the  friction member (24) against the control member to effect  a braking action.  the braking apparatus prevents throttle creep when  the unit is applied to the control of a gear selection and  throttle operating mechanism operated by a single lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
control unit braking apparatus this invention relates to control unit braking apparatus in which the control unit comprises a housing rotatably supporting a shaft projecting at one end from the housing and connected to a control member externally of the housing. the control unit can further include in the housing a driven member engageable with the shaft so as to be driven therewith, the shaft being axially movable to disengage it from the driven member. the present invention finds its principal application to single lever control units which sequentially operate a transmission and throttle and also permit independent operation of the throttle when the transmission is not engaged. such control units find particular use in marine applications. examples of-previous pertinent patents are united states patents 2,254,144; 3,127,785; 3,511,117; 3,581,603; 3,842,695 and 3,929,039. in us patent 3,842,695, the lever and shaft are not capable of axial movement, but a slider shaft in the lever assembly can be retracted. when the transmission is in the neutral position, retraction of the slider shaft disengages key 96 having projection 100 from the driving gear 56 and pulls pin 108 into hole 110. us patent 3,581,603 discloses a similar mechanism. us patent 3,842,695 differs from the present invention in several ways: first, the lock is on the slider shaft, not the lever; second, the slider shaft is nonrotatable; and third, the lock is not spring biased. in patent 3,581,603, the slider shaft is rotatable. us patents 3,511,117 and 3,127,785 disclose control levers which can be pulled outward when in neutral position, to open the throttle independently of the shift function. the control lever is spring biased. in us patent 3,511,117, a blocking flange 134 locks curved portion 133 of interlocking plate 131 against reverse to prevent accidental shift while in the neutral throttle mode. lateral wings 135 or 136 are interposed between the blocking flange 134 and gear 38 to prevent axial translation of the control lever 18 except in the neutral position. us patent 3,127,785 has a similarly functioning plate 70 and flange 37. the lever in us patent 3,929,039 contains a springloaded coupling shaft which can be disengaged while the lever is in a neutral position. the coupling shaft has radially extending pins 25 which couple the main shaft to the throttle gear. pressing in the coupling shaft against the spring disengages the pins from the gear, and the gear from the shaft. in operation, this mechanism functions in the reverse manner from the present invention. it is useful to be able to operate control units so that a braking effect is put on the control member operating the throttle opening to ensure that once set to a specific opening it remains at its setting and that no throttle creep occurs which may cause the throttle either to open or close from the set position. this risk of throttle creep particularly manifests itself where vibration occurs and where this vibration is transmitted to the control unit. it is an aim of the invention
