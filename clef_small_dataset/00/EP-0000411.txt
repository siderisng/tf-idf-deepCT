<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for producing blocks, books or calendars made of large bows with printed, mostly different pages that must be brought into an orderly order before binding.The previously conventional folding of the sheets can be omitted when the sheets (1) of a conveying device (4) are supplied and conveyed toward a cutting device (7, 8), the individual bends being stacked together manually.The cutting of the sheets takes place whenever a predetermined width of the individual sheets through the cutting device (7, 8) has been conveyed.
