<ABSTRACT>
a deodorant detergent product comprises a non-soap  detergent active compound, and a deodorant composition.   the product can be used for personal washing of the skin  and will as a result reduce human body malodour.  the  product can also be employed for washing fabrics which  when subsequently worn in contact with the skin aid in the  reduction of human body malodour.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to deodorant detergent products for use in suppressing human body malodour. background to the inventionit has long been recognised that the development of body malodour is largely due to bacterial action on the products of the sweat glands. washing the skin with a detergent, for instance in the form of a personal washing detergent bar, removes malodorous products and reduces the concentration of bacteria on the skin. likewise, washing soiled clothing with a fabric washing detergent product, for instance in the form of a powder or liquid detergent product, removes malodorous products and bacteria derived from the skin. it has been customary to incorporate germicides into detergent products, particularly those designed for personal washing, in the belief that growth of those skin microflora that contribute to body malodour can be inhibited and the production of malodorous substances suppressed. germicides are at least partly effective in reducing or retarding the development of body malodour, but they do not completely solve the problem, possibly because there are other causes of malodour development on the skin which are unrelated to the proliferation of bacteria. summary of the inventionit has now been discovered that certain combinations of substances other than germicides, hereinafter referred to as "deordorant compositions", when incorporated into a fabric washing detergent product, can be deposited onto the fabric of a garment washed with the product, so that the fabric of the garment then has the property of reducing body malodour when the garment is subsequently worn or otherwise applied in contact with the skin. in the course of attempts to characterise this new principle, many hundreds of substances and blends of substances have been screened for evidence of their deodorant activity. definition of the inventionin its widest aspect, the invention provides for the use of a deodorant detergent product for washing fabric to impart to said fabric the ability to suppress human body malodour when the fabric is worn as a garment, the detergent product comprising: (i) from 5 to 95% by weight if the product is solid, from 5 to 80% by weight if the product is a liquid, of non-soap detergent active compound chosen from anionic, nonionic, cationic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds; (ii) from 0.05 to 3% by weight of a deodorant composition comprising a combination of perfume materials that depress the partial vapour pressure of morpholine by at least 10% more than that required by raoult's law, the deodorant composition having a deodorant value, (as measured by the whitehouse and carter test modified by the use of a 0 to 5 grading scale, and assessment after 5 hours instead of 24 hours), when incorporated into a personal washing bar at a concentration of 1.5% by weight, of from 0.50 to 3.5; and (iii) other detergent adjuncts which include a builder and form the balance of the product; the detergent product having an odour reduction value of at least 0.50, the odour reduction value being defined by the odour reduction value test, which in

the use of a deodorant detergent product for washing  fabric to impart to said fabric the ability to suppress human  body malodour when the fabric is worn as a garment, the  detergent product comprising:  (i) from 5 to 95% by weight if the product is solid, from 5  to 80% by weight if the product is a liquid, of non-soap  detergent active compound chosen from anionic, nonionic,  cationic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active  compounds; (ii) from 0.05 to 3% by weight of a deodorant composition  comprising a combination of perfume materials that depress  the partial vapour pressure of morpholine by at least 10%  more than that required by raoult's law, the deodorant  composition having a deodorant value, (as measured by the  whitehouse and carter test modified by the use of a 0 to 5  grading scale, and assessment after 5 hours instead of 24  hours), when incorporated into a personal washing bar at a  concentration of 1.5% by weight, of from 0.50 to 3.5; and (iii) other detergent adjuncts which include a builder and form  the balance of the product;      the detergent product having an odour reduction value of at least 0.50, the odour reduction value being  defined by the odour reduction value test, which in turn is based on the whitehouse and carter test with  the following modification, namely that assessment of body malodour is performed 5 hours after treatment  instead of 24 hours, using a 0 to 5 instead of a 0 to 10 odour grading scale, the test being carried out  following application to shirt fabric during the wash cycle of a laundry process, the body malodour  remaining on the shirt fabric being assessed, rather than the malodour of the axilla itself, the fabric  washing and odour assessment being conducted as follows:  (a) polyester coat style button through shirts are prewashed in an automatic washing machine using a  nonionic detergent fabric washing powder to ensure that the shirts to be used in the odour reduction  value test are all equally clean and free from dressing prior to washing in the detergent product; (b) the prewashed shirts are line dried and washed again in the automatic washing machine in which  the wash liquor contains 0.4% by weight of the fabric washing powder or liquid product under test  containing 0.2% by weight of the deodorant composition, the ratio of shirt fabric (dry weight basis) to wash  liquor being 40g fabric per litre wash liquor; (c) the shirts are agitated in the wash liquor for 10 minutes at a temperature of 50°c, then rinsed and  spun to a moisture content of about 50% by weight water and finally line dried to a moisture content of not  greater than 10% to provide test shirts; (d) a further batch of the prewashed shirts to serve as control shirts are washed again and then dried  under similar conditions, except that the deodorant composition is omitted from the fabric washing  powder or liquid product added to the wash liquor; (e) the shirts are folded and stored overnight in polyethylene bags until required for testing by a panel  of male subjects, half the subjects then wearing test shirts treated with the deodorant composition-containing  fabric washing powder or liquid product and half wearing control shirts without deodorant  composition treatment; and (f) after 5 hours, the odour of the shirt fabric in the region of the axilla is scored in each case by female  assessors, the odour reduction value of the fabric washing powder or liquid product being finally     calculated as the difference between the average score for the shirts washed with the test product and the  average score for the shirts washed with the control product. the use of a detergent product according to claim 1, in which the non-soap detergent active  compound comprises an anionic detergent-active compound chosen from:  (a) sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates obtained by sulphating the c8―c18 alcohols produced by  reducing the glycerides of tallow or coconut oil; (b) sodium and potassium alkyl benzene sulphonates in which the alkyl group contains from 9 to 15  carbon atoms in straight chain or branched chain configuration; (c) sodium alkyl glycerol ether sulphonates; (d) sodium coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulphonates and sulphates; (e) sodium or potassium salts of alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulphate containing from 1 to 10  units of ethylene oxide per molecule and wherein the alkyl groups contain from 8 to 12 carbon atoms;
