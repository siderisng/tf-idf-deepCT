<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a motor vehicle speed control  system including an engine throttle actuator device (30)  comprising a bellows (23) in which the pressure is adjusted,  while the system is engaged, by an electromagnetic valve (c)  pulsed by signals from an electronic speed detector to  control orifices (17,16) connected to atmosphere and  vacuum respectively.  a second electromagnetic valve (b) is  biassed by spring (9) when de-energized to open orifice (10)  to atmosphere rapidly to vent the bellows when the system  is disengaged.  an additional safety means is provided by a  valve (32) which is operated by brake pedal (31) and, when  opened, will rapidly vent the bellows (23) through pipe (38)  and orifice (39) if valve (b) malfunctions.  resonator (r)  produces an audible warning signal when air flows thereÂ­ through.  the audible warning system may be used for other  applications.
