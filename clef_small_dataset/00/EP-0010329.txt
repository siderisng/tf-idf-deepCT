<ABSTRACT>
a torque converter comprises a plurality of friction ele­ ments (28 and 50) which are mounted rotatably on arms (25  and 45) which are pivotable on holders (20 and 40).  the hol­ ders (20 and 40) are interconnected by tie members (62).   rotation of an input shaft (1) rotates the holder (20) and, via  the tie members (62), the holder (40).  the friction elements (28  and 50) are thus flung outwardly into contact with control  members (64 and 65), on which they roll.  the friction elements  also abut and roll on one another, so that at least a major  proportion of axial forces on the friction element in operation,  are held in equilibrium by the elements themselves.  the rota­ tion of the friction elements (28 and 50) is transferred to an  output shaft (2) by planetary gearing.  the transmission ratio is  varied by moving the control member (64) towards and away  from the control member (65) which changes the circumfer­ ence of the path over which the element (28) rolls.  the holder  (40) is displaceable axially to accomodate this adjustment to  keep the friction elements (28 and 50) in contact.  the geometrical configuration and disposition of the fric­ tion elements (28 and 50) are important and are discussed in  the description.
