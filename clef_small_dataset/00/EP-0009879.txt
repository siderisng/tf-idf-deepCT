<ABSTRACT>
a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a  pharmaceutically acceptable carrier together with an in vivo  fibrinolytic enzyme as defined herein wherein the catalytic  site essential for fibrinolytic activity is blocked by a group  which is removable by hydrolysis at a rate such that the  pseudo-first order rate constant for hydrolysis is in the range  10⁻⁶ sec⁻¹ to 10⁻³ sec⁻¹ in isotonic aqueous media at ph 7. 4 at  37°c; is useful in the treatment of venous thrombosis.
