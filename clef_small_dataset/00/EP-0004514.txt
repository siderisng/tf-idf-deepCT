<ABSTRACT>
The molding, such as the mask (1), is composed of a powder capable of taking with water, such as a dental plaster and a salt, such as calcium chloride, dissolved in the outlet water.Metal contacts (3.3 ') are coated in the molding for the coupling to the generator (7) of processing current.A conventional counter-electrode (5) is provided for the return of the current to the generator.The mixture of powder and socket water which can contain, in addition to salt, adjuvants such as polyols, protein and vitamin surfactants is put in place before the start of the jack, and the processing current applied after the start.taking.After the plug is complete and the treatment is complete, the molding is detached and discarded.
