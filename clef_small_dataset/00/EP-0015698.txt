<ABSTRACT>
a striper (10) has a spring-loaded striping head (30)  which connects with a reservoir (16) only when the head (10) is  depressed by contact with a workpiece, and which does not  feed paint or other striping material at any other time.  a long,  closely fitted tube (31) minimizes leakage and has a side open­ ing (32) to valve stripe material.  the parts are readily disas­ sembled but are firmly held when assembled, for ready clean­ ing and replacement of worn parts.  the reservoir (16) is prefer­ ably separate for each head (30), and separately fed for any  striper head (30) or group of striper heads (30) to produce the  desired pattern of stripes.  the striper heads 30 may be of inter­ changeable widths.  a stop 13 is the only part retaining all  heads.
