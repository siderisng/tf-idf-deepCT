<ABSTRACT>
certain fluoropolymers, when chemically modified by  reacting them with sulfur or phosphorus containing com­ pounds, become hydrophilic materials useful for making  ion-exchange membranes, especially diaphragms for elec­ trolytic cells, particularly chlor-alkali cells used in the produc­ tion of chlorine, hydrogen and sodium hydroxide from brine.

<DESCRIPTION>
composition, preparation thereof, diaphragm or membrane made of that composition and use of the diaphragm or mei'ib ran background of the invention in commercial chlor-alkali cells used for the production of chlorine, hydrogen and sodium hydroxide from brine, asbestos diaphragms are ordinarily used as anion exchange membranes between the anolyte and catholyte compartments. diaphragms of this sort are generally satisfactory, but their electrical resistance is high and chlor-alkali cells which use such diaphragms therefore require more electric current for operation than is desirable. summary of the invention it has now been found that by chemically modifying certain fluoropolymers with sulfur or phosphorus containing compounds, the fluoropolymers are made hydrophilic. this makes them especially suited for use in making diaphragms for electrolytic cells. such diaphragms have less electrical resistance than those made solely of asbestos. there is, accordingly, less power loss in a chlor-alkali cell which uses this new diaphragm and the cell is therefore more efficient. indeed, it has been observed that the chlorine, hydrogen and caustic production.of a cell using this diaphragm can generally be held at the same level as one using an asbestos diaphragm while operating at 10-15% lower voltage. the hydrophilic fluoropolymers also have the inertness of fluoropolymers generally, and this makes them resistant to attack by the contents of conventional electrolytic cells. "hydrophilic", as used in this context, means that the modified fluoropolymers do not repel water as conventional fluoropolymers do, but instead absorb it. the term more specifically means that the modified fluoropolymers have water contact angles of 0 to about 500, as measured by the method and apparatus described on page 137 of "contact angle, wettability and adhesion", american chemical society, 1964. specifically, the hydrophilic fluoropolymers of the invention are chemically modified homopolymers, or copolymers (meaning they contain two or more different monomer units), derived at least in part from olefinic monomers completely substituted with fluorine atoms or completely substituted with a combination of fluorine atoms and no more than one chlorine, bromine or iodine atom per monomer. these fluoropolymers can also contain up to about 75 mol percent of units derived from other ethylenically unsaturated monomers. these hydrophilic fluoropolymers contain non-terminal units represented by the structure emi3.1 where g is -s02br -scl -socl -s02c1 -sxm -sxbr -sxc1 emi3.2 where m is hydrogen, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium or magnesium; r is an alkyl radical of 1-12 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl radical of 3-12 carbon atoms; and x is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. hydrophilic fluoropolymers containing nonterminal units of structure (1) where g is emi4.1 are preferred for use as diaphragm materials in electrolytic cells because of their low electrical resistance. the hydrophilic fluoropolymers can contain more than one type of unit of structure (1). the hydrophilic fluoropolymer will contain enough units of structure (1) to give it a sulfur or phosphorus content of about 0.1-10, by weight, but not so many that more than about 1%, by weight, of the polymer will dissolve in water at 200c. sulfur and phosphorus
