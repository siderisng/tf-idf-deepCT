<ABSTRACT>
In practical operation at the carousel for children's games, at the fixed center axis, a solid grip, from which the axis rotatable with the hands is rotated around the axis of seat cross. Seat direction, co-compatibility and mutual influence are unused. Carousel with mechanical drive inspections are complicated and transnational under construction. The new carousel provides a drive that corresponds to a sporty test and one of the rowing or similar rhythmic. Movements equivalent body movement requires. The rowing in front of the seat rudder bar is mounted horizontally on the central axis horizontally and has a pawl against a permanently arranged ring gear. After reaching the potential from the body from the coeper, the clinking includes the sprocket, which forms the rotary motion of the seat cross-resistor when engaging the holms. A uniformly oscillating movement of the body can be transferred to the pawl by a back and forth movable fit or rocker onto the hollow trajectory, so that in the vibration movement the turnstile is also rotated.
