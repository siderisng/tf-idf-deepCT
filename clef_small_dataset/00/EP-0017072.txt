<ABSTRACT>
synthetic lubricants containing (a) 15 to 45 weight  percent of an ester of a hindered polyhydric alcohol having 3  to 6 hydroxy groups and 5 to 10 carbon atoms with one or  more alkanoic acids having 4 to 18 carbon atoms blended  with (b) 85 to 55 weight percent of one or more polyoxyalÂ­ kylene glycols or their mono- or dialkyl ethers having a  400-5000 number average molecular weight.  the blends are  compounded with antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, and  metal deactivators to produce a superior lubricant for rotary  screw compressors that has a long life.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
water-resistant lubricant for compressors and marine engines this invention relates to water-resistant lubricants for compressors and marine engines, especially for use in rotary screw compressors. rotary screw air compressors are well-known in the art as can be seen from u.s. patent 3,073,513, issued to bailey, january 15, 1963. it is well-known to use hydrocarbon lubricating oils to seal the rotors of the foregoing rotary screw air compressors, lubricate the bearing and cool the compressed gases. due to the high temperature and pressure of the air, it has been found that these hydrocarbon oils break down and create a sludge in a relatively short time, i.e., about 1000 hours or less. in attempts to increase the intervals between changes of the lubricants, silicone fluids have been used. however, these fluids are very expensive and represent a considerable capital investment because a new compressor unit with different bearings and seals is required. it is known that synthetic esters made from dicarboxylic acids have been used in an attempt to develop a relatively inexpensive and long-lasting lubricant. however, it has been found that these synthetic esters are not hydrolytically stable, and therefore do not have the long life required for use in air compressors. synthetic lubricants comprising a major amount of a polyester and a minor amount of a monocapped polyglycol are known from british patent 1,162,818, i.c.i., august, 1969. however, these compositions are disclosed to be only useful in aircraft gas turbines where gross contamination with water is not a problem. it now has been found that a suitably inhibited blend of hindered alkanoic esters of aliphatic polyhydric alcohols having 3 to 6 hydroxyl groups and 5 to 10 carbon atoms with polyoxyalkylene glycols and their mono or dialkyl ethers has the required high temperature viscosity and stability to oxygen and water the present invention is a lubricant composition characterized in that it contains (a) 15 to 45 weight percent of an ester of a hindered polyhydric alcohol having 3. to 6 hydroxyl groups and from 5 to 10 carbon atoms with one or more alkanoic acids having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, and (b) 85 to 55 weight percent of one or more compositions having a flash point greater than 1910c and having the formula emi2.1 where r is hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1-6 carbon atoms, r' is hydrogen or methyl, and n is a number having an average value which will give a molecular weight range from 400 to 5000. an additional aspect of the present invention comprises the above base lubricant with the addition of effective amounts of oxidation inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, and metal or copper deactivators. while the lubricants of this invention are useful in rotary screw, sliding vane, and reciprocation pis -ton compressors, they are also useful in other mechanical devices where hydrolytic stability is desired or necessary, such as outboard motors or marine engines in general. the combination of the foregoing polyoxyalkylene glycols and esters with and without additives can also find utility in
