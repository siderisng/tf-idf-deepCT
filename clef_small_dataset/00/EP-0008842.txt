<ABSTRACT>
a multi-fuel gas burner using preheated forced draft air,  comprising a cylindrical inner burner tube (12), supported by  the wall of a furnace (34) and inserted into an opening in the  wall, means (94, 95, 96 and 97) being provided to inject  through the upstream end combustion air preheated to a  selected temperature and compressed to a selected pressure.   the downstream end of the inner burner tube is closed and a  plurality of longitudinal slots (72) are circumferentially spaced  in the wall of the tube at the closed end.  means (18) are  provided to inject rich fuel gas up to 3,500 btu/cu feet under  selected pressure into the inner burner tube along its axis.  an  outer burner tube (22) axially surrounds the inner burner tube  and forms an annular passage (49) therebetween.  means (28)  are also provided to pass low pressure, lean, combustible gas  of as low as 50 btu/cu feet down the annular passage (49) and  outwardly through a circumferential slot (56) at the end of the  outer burner tube inside the furnace.  the hot combustion air  and rich gas flowing through the inner tube and radially  outwardly and rearwardly through the plurality of slots, flow  against the mix with the lean gas flowing outwardly through  the circumferential slot, and burn against the surface (38) of a  tile (36), having a central opening, through which the burner is  inserted into the furnace.
