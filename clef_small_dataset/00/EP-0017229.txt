<ABSTRACT>
compositionally uniform but nonrandom copolymers of  ethylene and α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids  having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms are provided having an acid  content of from about 6 to about 35 weight percent, a melt  index of from about 0. 1 to about 800, and a ratio of weight  percent adjacent acid to weight percent total acid in the  copolymer of from about 0. 44 to about 1. 0.  these copolym­ ers have improved physical properties such as hardness,  stiffness, heat resistance and creep resistance.  further  provided, is a process for preparing these copolymers in a  constant environment stirred autoclave in a continuous  manner wherein the reaction zone is maintained in a steady  state at a pressure of from 0 to about 500 psi above, and at a  temperature of from 0 to about 15°c above that needed to  maintain a single phase reaction mixture at a given concen­ tration of copolymer and at the given acid comonomer  content of the copolymer.
