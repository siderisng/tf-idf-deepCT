<ABSTRACT>
A highly concentrated in aqueous media containing high-concentrated, fine dispersion, dispersant arms or free preparation contains: a) 40 to 90 wt. -% at least one in water-soluble to insoluble active substance with a mean particle size below 5 μm, b) 10 to 60 wt. -% of at least one water-soluble sal zes of an acid resin and C) O to 50 wt. -% Other additives, such as dispersants, wetting agents or coup agents or a mixture thereof. It is fine dispersers and is in solid form as a powder or granules. The preparation can be prepared as follows: a) a mixture of active substance (s) and water unresolved chem acid resin is treated with a solution of alkalis or amines in water or solvents and the flux is then removed. b) A mixture of active substance (s) and water unresolved chem acid resin is exposed to the steaming of ammonia or volatile amines. (c) a mixture of water-contaminated active substance and an aqueous solution of the acid resin salt is subjected to atomization drying. The preparation can be used as aqueous or aqueous organi shegal dispersion.
