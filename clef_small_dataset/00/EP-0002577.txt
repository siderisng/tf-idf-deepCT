<ABSTRACT>
a sample-viewing cabinet in which four mirrors (13, 14,  15, 16) define, when viewed in plan, a square area into which  e. g.  a carpet sample (23) can be inserted, is characterised in  that the particular mirror which, in use, forms the front  mirror (13) of the cabinet is constructed so as to be  effectively a one-way mirror which will reflect the image of  the viewed sample into the remaining mirrors (14, 15, 16) but  which will allow the sample and its reflected images to be  viewed directly through the front mirror rather than having  to be viewed from above it.  the one-way mirror effect may be achieved by covering  the inwardly facing surface of the front sheet of glass (13a)  with an aluminium coated polyester film and illuminating the  interior of the viewing enclosure with light (17) of sufficient  intensity to cause the film covered sheet to reflect into the  back mirror of the cabinet whilst allowing the back mirror to  be viewed directly through the front sheet if all the mirrors are surface-silvered, rather than backsilvered,  the image of the viewed sample is reflected  infinitely in all directions without interruption.  the ability to view the sample straight through the front  mirror enables the entire enclosure defined by the mirrors to  be angled towards the floor.  the overall height of the cabinet  can thus be reduced, so that people of widely varying heights  can obtain an ample view of the images reflected inside the  cabinet.
