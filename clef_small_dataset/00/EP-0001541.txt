<ABSTRACT>
a sinker weight for sea conduits, said weight being  made from concrete or another material of high density in  order to retain the conduit below the water surface against  the sea bottom.  the sinker weight (1), which is preferably  cylindrical in shape, is made in one piece and provided with  a through aperture (2) excentric in relation to the centre  of gravity (5) of the weight (1) for receiving the aperture  (2), and an entry passage (3) connecting the aperture (2)  with the periphery of the weight (1) in order to introduce  the conduit to the aperture (2).  the passage (3) opens  towards the aperture (2) laterally in relation to a plane  including the centre axis of the aperture and the centre of  gravity of the weight.  the passage (3) may comprise a restriction (4) immediately  before the aperture (2).  the aperture (2) may  comprise a liner (6) of a resilient material.  after the mounting  operation the passage (3) may be filled with a filling  material, such as a plastic.
