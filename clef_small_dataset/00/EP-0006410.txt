<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for weighing and grading fowl  hanging from shackles of a continuously moving overhead  conveyor, having a plurality of balance arms extending ra­ dially outwards from the vertical central axis of the appa­ ratus and being pivotably supported by slide blocks moun­ ted on vertical guide bars rotating about the central axis  and driven by the overhead conveyor.  the outer ends of  the balance arms are adapted, while moving along with the  conveyor at the same speed, to catch and lift the shackles  so that they are no longer supported by the conveyor by  moving the slide blocks upwards, and the inner ends of the  balance arms are adapted to come to bear on a load cell  located in the central axis when given free by a locking  pin.
