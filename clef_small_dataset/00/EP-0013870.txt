<ABSTRACT>
a machine for manufacture of spiral tubing with folded  seam, including a number of preshaping roller pairs (19, 19′)  for a strip material and a folding roller pair (27, 28), arranged  to form a folded seam in connection with a coiling and tube  shaping tool (32), each roller pair (19, 19′, 27, 28) being  arranged with a separate hydraulic motor (17), arranged to  drive one of the rollers (19′, 27), the second roller (19, 28)  being connected and driven by means of a cog wheel  transmission, a chain transmission or similar, the transmis­ sion driven rollers (19,28) being arranged movable in rela­ tion to the adjacent rollers (19′, 27) in the same roller pair  and being spring loaded in direction towards same, the  hydraulic motors (17) being connected to each other in  series, thus driving the individual roller pairs (19, 19′, 27, 28)  with a successively reduced speed, each roller (19, 19′, 27,  28) including at least one surrounding circumferential  groove (20), into which semi-circular ring members (21, 21′),  having an outwardly extending portion, or a groove, at the  outer peripheral surface, are insertable and attachable.
