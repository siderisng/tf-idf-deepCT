<ABSTRACT>
a thermostatic electrical switch for providing an electri­ cally conductive path when the temperature of the switch is  below a threshold temperature and for opening the path when  the temperature of the switch is above the threshold tempera­ ture, includes a bimetallic thermostatic element (14) which is  riveted to a support post (20).  the latter is welded to a base  plate (10) which forms a portion of the switch casing.  an  indentation (44) is formed in the casing such that a portion (42)  of the mounting (36) for an electrically conductive terminal  (30) is urged downwardly, thus positioning the terminal (30)  for proper switch operation.
