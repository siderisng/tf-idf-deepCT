<ABSTRACT>
the inner surface of an x-ray tube envelope is constructed  to prevent the build-up of an electrically conductive  layer of metal deposits on the tube envelope in the regions  adjacent to and between the cathode focusing element and  the anode.  in the disclosed embodiment this area is textured  so that metal deposits can only collect in certain places and  not in others.  the places of metal collection are spaced so that  the development of a conductive metal layer is inhibited.  by  properly texturing the inner surface of the envelope, this  spaced collection of metal is so effective that the spaced  regions of metal build-up are electrically insulated from one  another.  a method is disclosed comprising first mechanically  abrading the inner surface of the envelope to create small  fracture regions.  thereafter, the abraded surface is acidetched.   the acid attacks the areas of the envelope which  exhibit these fracture regions creating relatively deep and  narrow "canyons" (32) surrounding "islands" (30).  the  canyons are of such steepness and depth that the trajectory of  particles of metal released from the tube elements do not  form conductive layers in the canyons.
