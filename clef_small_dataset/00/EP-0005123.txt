<ABSTRACT>
pre-treatment for improving the adhesion of paint  systems to metal sheets such as the steel sheets used in the  automotive industry.  the pre-treatment is applied to the  metal sheets before the latter are submitted to the surface  conversion cycle (e. g.  phosphating) and to the subsequent  painting process.  according to the invention the pre-treatment consists in  inserting the steel sheet alternately as cathode and anode of  an electrolytic cell containing essentially a 0. 5 m - 2. 0 m  sodium sulphate aqueous solution.  the operating temperature  is selected between 20°c and 100°c.  the current density  flowing through the cell ranges from 1 to 50 a/dm².   treatment time is selected between 0. 1 and 30 seconds.  the invention permits the removal of both organic residues  and inorganic inclusions with one comprehensive  treatment only.
