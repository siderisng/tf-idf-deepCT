<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for reforming fuel oil wherein ultrasonic  waves are utilized.  the apparatus comprises a closed vessel  (15), a rotary collector (25) formed in a cylindrical shape, an  inlet conduit (22) for supplying fuel oil to be reformed into  the vessel, an outlet conduit (33) for delivering reformed oil  from the vessel, and a ultrasonic irradiating device (3).  the  rotary collector has a layered mesh structure (23) of a fine  mesh, preferably of mesh size between 2 µm and 20 µm,  mounted thereon so that sludge contained in the fuel oil to  be reformed (21) is collected on the layered mesh structure  (23).  one end of a horn (4) connected to the ultrasonic wave  irradiating device (3) faces the layered mesh structure (23)  forming a small gap therebetween so that the sludge col­ lected on the layered mesh structure is dispersed by the  ultrasonic waves.

<DESCRIPTION>
an a-rparatus for re;ops jg fuel oil wherein ultrasonic waves are utilized technical field to ich the invention relates the present invention relates to an apparatus ror reforming fuel oil, more specifically an apparatus for ref drying fuel oil wherein ultrasonic waves are utilized so that the combustibility of the fuel oil is increased. due to the recent shortage of petroleum, the quality of fuel oil which is available for internal combustion engines, especially diesel engines of a large size, such as a marine engine, may be degraded in the near future. to overcome the degradation of fuel oil, some internal combustion engine maneracturers are trying to improve the availability of fuel oil by using lower grade fuel oil for their engines. however, it is very difficult to overcome the degradation of ruel oil by only such an improvement. on the other hand, there are some possubilities of overcoming the degradation of fuel oil if fuel oil is reformed by a specially designed treatment systems, so that a diesel engine can burn such degraded fuel oil without combustion trouble. background art of the invention to increase the combustibility and the ignition ability of an internal combustion engine, it is necessary to remove from the fuel oil heavy, oxidized deteriorating oily products deposits comprised of high molecular hydrocarbons which contain impurities, such as asphaltene; such deteriorating products will be referred to hereinafter as sludge. conventionally the fuel oil for use, for example, in a marine engine is subjected to one or more of the following methods on the ship so that the sludge is removed. (a) a method wherein a sedimentation tank is used. (b) a method wherein a centrifugal separator is used. (c) a method wherein a filter having a mesh size of between 45 m and 75 m is used. it is ell known that, as the grade of the fuel oil is lowered, the sludge content in the fuel oil is considerably increased and its specific gravity is also increased, and accordingly, there is not an obvious difference in specific gravity between the sludge and the degraded fuel oil, because the sludge is essentially comprised of hydrocarbons and comparatively small amounts of ash con3nt, so that it is difficult to remove the sludge contained in the degraded fuel oil in accordance with the above-mentioned method (a) or (b) wherein the difference in the specific gravity is utilized. when the method (c) is carried out for removing sludge contained in the degraded fuel oil, the mesh size applied in a conventional filter. is too large. morn specifically, the mesh size of a filter utilized in the above-mentioned conventional method (c) is larger than 45 m, and, as a result, only particles laxer than 45 n in diameter are strained out by means of the filter. it has been said, however, that it is preferable for increasing the combustibility of an internal combustion engine to strain out sludge contained in fuel oil, the particle size of which sludge is between
