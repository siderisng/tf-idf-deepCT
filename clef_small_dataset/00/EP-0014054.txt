<ABSTRACT>
a process for the preparation of a composite reverse  osmosis membrane characterised in that the process com­ prises the steps of:   (a) coating a porous support with a layer comprising  an aqueous solution containing, dissolved therein, an es­ sentially water-soluble monomeric polyfunctional secondary  amino or polyamide prepolymer terminated with secondary  amino functional groups, the secondary amine functionality  of the prepolymer being greater than 2. 0;   (b) contacting the layer with a polyfunctional acid ha­ lide for a time sufficient to effect in-situ chain extension  and crosslinking reactions between the secondary amino  and the acid halide; and   (c) drying the product of step (b) to form the compo­ site reverse osmosis membranes.  membranes produced by this process are useful in  separating components of fluid mixtures or solutions, such  as the removal of salts from aqueous solutions, in particu­ lar the desalination of saline water, by reverse osmosis.
