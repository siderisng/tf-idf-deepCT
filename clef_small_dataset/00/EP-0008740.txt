<ABSTRACT>
in apparatus and method for record reorientation follow­ ing error detection in a data storage system (10), each data  track (30) is subdivided into equal time-length recording cells  which are sequentially numbered past an index point with the  beginning of each field of each record coinciding with an  initial cell for the field.  upon detection of a retriable error  within a given field, the initial cell for the field is determined  and stored, the system is disconnected from channel interface  (20), and reorientation is attempted by advancing a trans­ ducer (26) addressing the track (30) past the index point to a  location which is a selected distance upstream of the stored  cell number.  if a selected channel command is then received  within a given time interval, the system is reconnected to the  channel and reorientation is effected as the transducer (26)  enters the field the initial cell of which was stored.  if the  selected channel command is received late, the subsystem  waits one revolution of the track and then reorients without  looking for further channel commands.
