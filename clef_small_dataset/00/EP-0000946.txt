<ABSTRACT>
two servoing functions, both operating from the data reading and recording transducer, are performed in a high performance movinghead disc drive.  one servo rapidly moves the head from its current track to any other track utilizing absolute track identifying addresses recorded in the inter-sector gap between data sectors.  once located on a track, the other servo maintains head location precisely over the center of that track while data is being read or recorded employing track following information also recorded in the inter-sector gap.  the resolution of transducer location is enhanced by secondary use of the track following information.
