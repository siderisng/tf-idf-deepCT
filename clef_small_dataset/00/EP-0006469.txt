<ABSTRACT>
a random access bubble memory directs a plurality of  continuous streams of bubbles toward a plurality of storage  loops (42a, 42b, 42c).  a write decoder (16a, 16b, 16x)  selects one continuous stream of bubbles.  an annihilator  (30a, 30b, 30x) then transforms this one continuous stream  of bubbles into the desired data pattern which is then stor­ ed in a selected loop.  while the data pattern is being form­ ed, a read decoder (44a, 44b, 44x) directs the data which  had been stored in the selected loop to a bubble detector  (52).  this memory has a unified read/write cycle which  permits intermixed read and write, read/modify/write, and  swap operations.  this bubble memory allows a user to re­ move power abruptly during a read/write cycle without  returning a partially processed block to its storage loop and  without saving the identity of the block.  in a preferred em­ bodiment, the read and write decoders are operated simul­ taneously by identical control currents.
