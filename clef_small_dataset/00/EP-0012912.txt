<ABSTRACT>
a thin film magnetic transducer for reading and writing a  track on a magnetic recording medium consists of layers  deposited on a deposition surface of a non-magnetic subs­ trate (20) which has an air bearing surface (abs) at right  angles to the deposition surface.  two of the layers (14, 15) are  of magnetic material to form a yoke (13) with a pole tip region  having a transducing gap (18) at the air bearing surface(abs),  and with a back region.  a read/write coil (10a to 10h) is  coupled to the back region.  the pole tip region has a width approximating to track  width and a length (d) of approximately 5/d where d is the  recording density on the recording medium in order to minim­ ise signals from adjacent tracks and maximise read resolu­ tion.  the thickness and width of the layers (14, 15) in the back  region are greater than those dimensions in the pole tip reg­ ion, the increase in width being provided by a taper.  the width  of the back region is greater than the width of the pole tip  region, the wider back region tapering to join the pole tip  region.  also the thickness of the back region magnetic layers  (14,15) is at least 60% greater than the thickness of the pole tip  region.  the back region is designed taking into account sat­ uration to provide an efficient write operation.
