<ABSTRACT>
the device for preparing crowns, bridges, dentures or the like has a support for the model produced by filling the impression taken from the jaw.  in order to be able to produce master models from which individual parts can be removed simply and free from damage and into which they can be re-inserted positionally accurately, the support consists of a model support plate (10) which is provided on its rear side with locking projections (12) which are arranged close together and can be pressed into recesses of a baseplate (1), which recesses are flush with them, for the purpose of releasable fixation.  the model support plate (10) and the baseplate (1) can be separated from one another in a tilt-free manner using a separating device (fig.  9).    <image>
