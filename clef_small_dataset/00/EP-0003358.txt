<ABSTRACT>
The chlorination of ethylene to 1,2-dichloroethane in the presence of chlorination catalyst is generally carried out in a solution of the reactants in the product under continuous feeding of the reactants depending on the product discharge, with constant pumping of the reaction mixture by a heated reaction zone and at chlorine excess. The chlorine excess prevents the formation of resinous products and ensures good ethylene conversion, but also increases the content of chlorine substitution products in the reaction product. The latter disadvantage is largely eliminated by continuous measurement and constant holdings of chlorine surplus at 50 to 500 wt. PPM, based on Ethylene. For this purpose, the chlorine content of the liquid reaction medium is continuously detected by means of an electrode arrangement consisting of a platinum and a calimental electrode with a lithium chloride solution as inner electrolyte, and the thus generated, the chlorine content of the reaction medium proportional electrical signal is used for fine regulation of the ethylene industry depending on the chlorine introduction .
