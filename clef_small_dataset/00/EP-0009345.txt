<ABSTRACT>
a method and system for whole picture image pro­ cessing achieves automatic texture and color analysis in a  rapid and economical manner.  the method involves the  generation of texture parameters as a result of processing  image data for a whole picture at a time.  the system com­ prises a plurality of image memoires for storing digital  image data, and a high speed video processor which ob­ tains whole picture image data and processes same so as  to analyze such whole picture image data at high speeds.   the system also includes a video crossbar switch, master  and slave timing control units, and a transformation unit  associated with each image memory.
