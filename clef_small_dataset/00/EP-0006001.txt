<ABSTRACT>
a method of fabricating a field effect transistor comprising  the steps of forming an active layer of semiconductor  material eg gaas, over a surface of a first substrate (1) of  semiconductor material, eg also gaas forming a gate  electrode (7) on the surface of the active layer (4), applying a  second substrate (11) of insulating material to the surface of  this structure, removing the first substrate, and forming  source and drain electrodes (16, 17) on the opposite surface  of the active layer to the gate electrode.  to facilitate removal  of the gaas first substrate by selective etching, a buffer layer  (2) of the gaa1as resistant to the gaas etchant, may be formed  between the active layer and the first substrate, which buffer  layer is removed, following removal of the first substrate,  using a selective etchant to which the gaas active layer is  resistant.  a second gate electrode may be formed on the  opposite surface of the active layer to that on which the first  gate electrode is formed.  the technique is particularly  applicable to high frequency fet devices.
