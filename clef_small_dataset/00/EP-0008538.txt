<ABSTRACT>
a profiled wheel tread for the self-steering wheelsets of  railway vehicles has a running surface (10) including a run­ ning zone (12), a wheel flange (16), and a taping line passing  through the running zone (12).  the invention provides that the  effective conicity across at least part (24) of the running zone  (12) on the gauge side of the taping line decreases in a direc­ tion towards the wheel flange (16).  in the example of figure 1  the part (24) of the running zone (12) on the gauge side of the  taping line is formed by a series of smoothly merging arcs of  which the radii (40, 42, 44, 46) increase from the taping line to  the fillet portion (14) which merges the running zone (12) into  the wheel flange (16), so that the effective conicity of the tread  decreases across the whole of the running zone (12) on the  gauge side of the taping line.  in another example.  however,  the effective conicity of the running zone (12) on the gauge  side of the taping line initially increases from the taping line  reaches a maximum at a lateral deflection of between 1,5 and  4 mm from the taping line, and then decreases towards the  wheel flange (16).  the wheel flange (16) is made thinner than  normal to increase the gauge clearance.  improvements are  thereby obtained firstly in wheel tread wear and rail wear by  minimising the creep forces; secondly in hunting stability,  because the effective conicity at maximum lateral deflection is  low; and thirdly in steering ability, because of a high average  conicity and increased gauge clearance.
