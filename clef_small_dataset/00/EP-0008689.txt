<ABSTRACT>
the manufacture of material webs of foamed plastics  generally takes place by extrusion of the material in tubu­ lar form, whereupon the material whilst it is still in soft  condition is calibrated, that is to say expanded by means  of a mandrel, so that the desired tube diameter and thus  the desired material thickness is obtained.  the material  tube is then cooled and cut up axially and laid flat to a  web.  this manufacturing procedure gives a final product  with uneven surface, since the pores and craters which the  material surface presents will be enlarged when the tube is  expanded.  moreover, the cooling as well as the contact  pressure of the material against the mandrel will be vary­ ing, which further increases the uneveness of the surface  and gives the material an uneven quality.  a more uniform  material surface and a more homogeneous material tube is  obtained in accordance with the invention, in that the mat­ erial tube (3) after extrusion is pressed, by means of com­ pressed air introduced into the tube, against an outer calib­ ration element (5) and is cooled at the same time, so that  its temperature drops below the softening temperature of  the material.  in this way the cooling as well as the contact  pressure can be controlled, and by imparting moreover a  profiled surface to the outer calibrating element, a rational  manufacture of a material web of foamed thermoplastics  of good quality and uniform surface is made possible.
