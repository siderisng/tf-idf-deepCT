<ABSTRACT>
a tension wrap packaging machine has a supporting  frame (11) and a driving assembly mounted in the supporting  frame, a man drive shaft is mounted in the supporting  frame and at one end has a supporting member fixedly  connected thereto to be rotated by the drive shaft when  the driving assembly is in operation.  mounted and rotatable  with the supporting member are a package supporting  assembly (50) for supporting a package to be  wrapped thereon and in spaced relation thereto a wrapping  material supporting assembly (70) for the material  (wm) to wrap the package.  package supporting assembly  and wrapping material supporting assembly in addition  to rotating with the closure disc are independently rotatable,  the package supporting assembly being rotated  preferably by a planetary driving means, and the wrapping  material supporting assembly being rotated by an  auxiliary driving means operatively connected between  the driving assembly and wrapping material supporting  assembly.  the auxiliary driving means includes, an adjustable  means to regulate the force or tension required  to be exerted on the wrapping material to remove it from  the dispensing roll supporting assembly when the  wrapping material is wrapped around the package on the  package supporting assembly.
