<ABSTRACT>
this specification discloses certain improvements in  resealable pressure releasing closures of the type disclosed  in u. s.  patents 4,105,134 and 4,155,480 debenham et al.  in  the several improvements disclosed in the specification,  the resealing properties of the closure are improved by  reducing the concentration of the flexure of the closure at  the connection between the closure and the can end to  thereby reduce the extent to which the material defining  the connection permanently deforms during the opening  operation.  in one embodiment the pressure releasing clos­ ure or tab 20 has a connection 23 to the can end which is  at substantially the same level as the adjacent portion of  the closure by the provision of an area 26 immediately  behind the connection which is downwardly depressed so  as to be co-planar with the tab 20.  in another embodiment  the upwardly raised bead 31 extends from the connection  32 into the closure 30 to substantially stiffen the connec­ tion 32 and discourage bending of the sheet metal at the  connection 32.  other embodiments involve the cold reduc­ tion of the pressure releasing closure and the shape of the  closure to make the bending thereof more uniform during  the opening operation.
