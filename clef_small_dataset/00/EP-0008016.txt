<ABSTRACT>
In a time-multiplexing system with multiple access (TDMA system), the format of the transmitted data can be changed in dependence from the trouble influences to the transmission links. From each station (A, B, C), a bundle of channels is sent out in the time-division multiplexing in the time-related time period. In normal mode, the destination address and 480 data bits are sanded in a channel at the beginning. In the case of troublership mode, two channels are provided for the same da tenbit amount. In this case, a display information is transmitted to be started, which allows a distinction of the fault protection mode on the EMP fishing site. This is transferred to the destination address and the data bits, the number of data bits be extended by adding another 480 redundant test bits to 960 bits (double redundancy code). The same double redundancy code also encodes the destination address and the format display error encoded.
