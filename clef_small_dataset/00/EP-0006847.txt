<ABSTRACT>
a foamable polymer composition comprising a resinous  polymer and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic polycarboxylic  acids carrying nuclear nitro groups that is substantially soluÂ­ ble in acetone but substantially insoluble in water obtained as  a result of the nitric acid oxidation of a carbonaceous material,  such as coal.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
foamable polymer compositions this invention relates to a foamable polymer composition comprising a resinous polymer and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic polycarboxylic acids derived from a carbonaceous material, such as coal. foamed resinous polymers, such as thermoplastic or thermosetting polymers, are of significant commercial interest, because they are lightweight and relatively inexpensive, have excellent chemical stability and are easily iabricated into a wide variety of useful articles, such as insulated containers for cold foods, buoyant fillers for life preservers, toys, disposable coffee cups, etc. in a typical foaming process a foaming agent is admixed intimately with the resinous polymer and the mixture is heated in a mould to a temperature above the decomposition temperature of the foaming agent, whereupon the foaming agent decomposes to yield gaseous products which cause the polymer to foam. thereafter the polymer is cooled and retains its foamed configuration. desirably, the foaming agent should be inexpensive, mix well with the resinous polymer, provide sufficient and controllable foaming power and should have no residual adverse effect upon the equipment used during the foaming step or on the resulting foamed polymer. the materials conventionally used as foaming agents are, commercially, comparatively expensive and technically they do not mix well with the resinous polymers, during foaming they produce undesirable or toxic gases and they may leave undesirable residues in the foam produced. we have found a foaming agent that overcomes these problems and which is suitable for incorporation into a resinous polymer to form a foamable polymer composition. the foaming agent is a mixture of polycyclic aromatic polycarboxylic acids carrying nuclear nitro groups that is substantially soluble in acetone but substantially insoluble in water and may be obtained by the oxidation of a carbonaceous material, such as coal with nitric acid. the foaming agent used in this invention herein can be prepared in accordance with the procedure described and claimed in our u.s. application serial no. 696,752 entitled "organic acids and process for preparing same". as noted, the foaming agent used in this invention is a mixture of polycyclic aromatic polycarboxylic acids carrying nuclear nitro groups which is substantially soluble in acetone but substantially insoluble in water. the individual components of said mixtures are believed to be composed of condensed and/or non-condensed benzene rings, with an average number of benzene rings in the individual molecules ranging from two to about ten, but generally from three to about eight. on the average, the number of carboxyl groups carried by the individual molecules will range from about four to about ten, generally from about six to about eight, and the average number of nitro groups from about one to about four, generally from about two to about three. the average molecular weight of the mixture will range from about 600 to about 1500, generally from about 700 to about 1000, and the average neutral equivalent will range from about 80 to about 200, generally from about 100 to about 150. a typical analysis of the mixture is defined below in table
