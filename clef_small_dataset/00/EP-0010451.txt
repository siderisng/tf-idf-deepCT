<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a process for the delignification of  lignocellulosic material by treatment with an alkaline liquor in  the presence of a cyclic keto compound such as anthra­ quinone.  the lignocellulosic material in subdivided form is  first impregnated with the alkaline liquor containing a suitable  amount of the cyclic keto compound whereafter any excess  liquor is drained.  the impregnated material is then cooked by  heating.  the delignified products are suitable for the man­ ufacture of paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "process for the delignification of lignocellulosic material and products thereof". this invention relates to a process for the delignification of lignocellulosic material such as wood, straw, bagasse, etc. and in particular relates to an improved vapour phase alkaline pulping process for the production of a chemical cellulosic pulp. the processing of lignocellulosic material to produce cellulose suitable for the manufacture of paper products involves the removal of lignin and other noncellulosic components such as gums. reagents that attack lignin without appreciably affecting the cellulose component are preferred for this purpose. it is still a general practice today to use these reagents in the form of aqueous solutions and to effect the cooking of lignocellulosic material in such solutions under conditions of temperature and pressure chosen to provide an acceptable lignin to cellulose ratio. depending upon the nature of the reagents used, this licuid phase process is known as the soda process wherein the reagent is sodium hydroxide alone, the kraft process wherein the reagents are sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide, the polysulphide process wherein the reagents are sodium hydroxide, sodium sulphide and polysulphides, or the neutral sulphite semichemical process in which the reagents are an alkali metal base such as sodium hydroxide and an alkali metal sulphite such as sodium sulphite. all these reagents have in common that they give alkaline aqueous solutions and thus constitute alkaline cooking liquors. in attempts to improve on the above liquid phase process, certain modifications have been proposed. one such modification, known as the vapour phase process, consists in impregnating lignocellulosic material in a suitably divided form with an alkaline cooking liquor, withdrawing any excess of cooking liquor and then cooking the impregnated material under the same time and temperature conditions as in conventional liquid phase pulping. an example of this process wherein kraft liquor is used as the impregnating liquor is described by kleinert in united states patent no. 3,215,588 issued on 2nd november, 1965. as compared with the liquid phase process, the vapour phase process affords an increased pulping rate and lower chemical requirements. another recently proposed modification is described in british application no, 5374/77 filed on 9th february, 1977 (united states patent no. 4,012,280, issued on 15th march, 1977) as well as in united states application serial no. 750,441, filed on 14th december, 1976, and united states patent nos. 4,036,680 and 4,036,681, issued on 19th july, 1977. in these applications, it is taught to effect the cooking of lignocellulosic material in a liquid phase process with an alkaline pulping liquor, there being present in said liquor from 0.001% to 10.0% by weight based on the lignocellulosic material of a cyclic keto compound selected from the group consisting of naphthoquinone, anthraquinone, anthrone, phenanthrenequinone, the alkyl, alkoxy and amino derivatives of these compounds, 6,l1-dioxo-1h-anthral,2-c pyrazole, anthraquinone-1,2-naphthacridone, 7,12-dioxo-7,12 dihydroanthrarl,2-g pyrazine, 1, 2-benzanthraquinone, 10methylene anthrone and the unsubstituted and lower alkyl substituted diels alder adducts of naphthoquinone and benzoquinone. as compared with the conventional liquid phase process, this modification which consists in the addition
