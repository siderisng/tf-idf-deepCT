<ABSTRACT>
a two-piece sheet metal nail (10) comprises a one-piece  shank portion (12) and a one-piece head portion (14) which  may be quickly and manually assembled without specialized  tools.  the shank portion (12) includes a pair of oppositely ex­ tending wing members (32 and 34) at its end remote from its  point which cooperate with a pair of tabs (46 and 48) provided  on the head portion (14) to assemble the shank portion (12) to  the head portion (14).  projections (not shown) on the wing  members self-lockingly engage in apertures formed by  pressed out portions (36, 38) of the tabs.  the shank portion  (12) is inserted through an aperture (44) in the head portion  (14) and rotated relative to the head portion in order to assem­ ble the nail.
