<ABSTRACT>
The guide device made of contaminated hollowpro fila portions (10) made of thin-walled steel sheet, whose hot-dip galvanized interior is foamed with plastic (20) is a symmetrical, at least on three sides of sheet metal chain cross-section with substantially downwardly decreasing width, whose possibly possibly facing the ground. Open page touches this. The partly in the soil and partly in the recesses practiced in the hollow section sections (21) protruding support are thus not exposed. The cross-sectional shape of the hollow profile whose largest width is above the height of the average wheel is approximately those of an upright fungus or even a trapezoid whose small base touches the ground and whose pages are inclined at most 30 ° for vertical. Each hollow section section is shaped from a sheet metal web; To make a closed hollow profile section, the longitudinal edges (11, 12) of the sheet metal web are rigid and conjured and covered by means of the opposing sheet metal tab (13). The side walls of the hollow profiles can be corrugated, with the wave mountains parallel to the trunk.
