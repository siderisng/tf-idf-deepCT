<DESCRIPTION>
piezoelectric ceramic production this invention is concerned with a method of preparing piezoelectric ceramics, particularly such ceramics having high piezoelectric response for use in, for example, ultrasonic transducers and ceramic filters. lead titanate-lead zirconate ceramics, ternary system pb (mg1/3nb2/3) o3 - pbtio3 - pbtio3 - pbzro3 ceramics and quaterary system pb ( zn1/3nb2/3) o3 1/3 2/3 3 pb (sn1/3nb2/3) o3 - pbtio3 - pbzro3 ceramics have been used as piezoelectric ceramics. these piezoelectric ceramics are commonly made by sintering of the appropriate ceramic composition and then. polarizing the material by applying a d.c. voltage so as to impart electromechanical transducing properties thereto. it would be desirable to provide piezoelectric ceramics of improved electromechanical coupling factor to obtain higher piezoelectric response, but it is difficult to make much imprevement by refining the composition. we have no developed a method of preparing a piezoelectric ceramic material having a high electro- mechanical coupling factor, which comprises heat treating at a temperature of from 500 c to 1050 c for 0.5 to 60 hours, a sintered ceramic material of the composltion: i. ( 1 - w) (pbti1-zzrzo3 ) + wmno2, wherein 0.004 # w # 0.06, 0.48 < z # 0.64, and up to 10 atomic 0a of pb may be replaced by one or more of sr, ca and ba, or ii. pb ([b1]a nb1-a) o3-pbtio3 pb (b2]b nb1-b) o3 - pb ([b3]cnb1-c) o3 - pbtio3 pbzro with mno21 3 pb ( mnl/3nb2/3 ) 03 - pbtio3 - pbzro3, or pb ( [ 8 d nbl,d) o3 - pb (mn1/3nb2/3 ) 03 - pbtio3 pbzro3, wherein b2 + b3, each of b1, b, b3 and b4 is one or more of mg, zn, cd, sn, fe, co and ni when a, b, c and d = 1/3 , and li and/or cu when a, b, c and d = x , and up to 20 atomic ,' of pb may be replaced by one or more of sr, ca and ba. the resulting piezoelectric ceramics have much higher electromechanical coupling factors than one which have not been heat treated. the sintered ceramic material used in the method according to the invention is preferably made by mixing the ingredients in appropriate (weighed) proportions, calcining the mixture, pulverizing the calcined material, shaping the powder thus obtained, and then sintering the shaped body. before calcining, the ingredients may be mixed in the wet in a ball mill and then filtored and dried. the calcined material may be pulverized by wet-grinding, followed by filtering and drying. the sintering may be effected without pressing cr with hot-pressing, for example, at a temperatnre of 1050 to 1300 c and a pressure of 100 to 503 kg/cm2 for 0.5 to 24 hours. such hot-press sintering conditions are suitable for obtaining ceramics of high mechanical strength. in order that the present invention may be more fully understood, the following examples are given by way of illustration only. in the examples, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings, in which: figures
