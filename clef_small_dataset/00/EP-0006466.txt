<ABSTRACT>
In a charge shifting device, two registers (S1, S2) are provided, which are filled serially with DA tenbits and are connected to the parallel channels of a charge-shifting memory (P) ver.The output stage of each of the two registers is each connected to a regenerator, which is both a bidirectional manifold (B1, B3) with an input / output data device (I / O; R / D), as well as the input stage of each otherRegister is connected.A method of operating the charge shift device is that each of the two registers (S1, S2) is used both as input and from gangs register and that the shift of the charge packets in the parallel part (P) of the device in adjacentChannels (C) at the same time in different directions.
