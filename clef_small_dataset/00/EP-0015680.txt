<ABSTRACT>
a process for separating gas bubbles from an aqueous  medium in which they are entrained and to an apparatus  therefor.  in the process the aqueous medium is continu足 ously circulated round a system comprising a riser and a  downcomer, connected at their lower ends, and a vessel  connecting the upper ends of the riser and the downcomer  and in which gas is disengaged from the aqueous medium  using a separator (1) which comprises a plurality of spac足 ed plates (4a, 4b, 4c) stacked one above another.  the in足 vention has particular utility in fermenters for the produc足 tion of single cell protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
separation process and apparatus this invention relates to a separation process, particularly for separating gas bubbles from an aqueous medium in which they are entrained, and also to apparatus therefor. in some industrial processes, in particular continuous fermentation and water treatment processes, it is desirable to inject a gas, eg air or oxygen, into an aqueous medium at one or more points and to remove the gas bubbles entrained in the aqueous medium at one or more points displaced from the injection points. the gas may be injected for a variety of reasons, including, in particular in an aerobic fermentation process or biological water treatment process, where the gas is air or oxygen, the provision of the oxygen level required for the biological process involved in the fermentation or water treatment, and/or the means whereby circulation or transport of the aqueous medium is effected. thus processes such as continuous fermentation or water treatment may be conducted in an elongated vertical apparatus in which the aqueous medium is circulated: the apparatus may have one or more chambers down which the aqueous medium is caused to flow from the top of the apparatus to the bottom thereof (such a chamber or chambers is herein referred to as the downcomer) and one or more chambers herein the aqueous medium is caused to flow from the bottom of the apparatus to the top (such a chamber or chambers is herein referred to as the riser). the apparatus may be in the form of two coaxial tubes wherein one tube forms the riser and the other forms the downcomer. instead of coaxial tubes a similar effect may be achieved by means of appropriately designed baffles, or by separate vessels interconnected at the top and bottom. in such apparatus the gas is injected into the downcomer and/or riser. the injection of the gas into the downcomer and/or riser may be employed to effect circulation of the aqueous medium. such a process is described in our british patent specification 1473665. on reaching the top of the riser, the aqueous medium is transferred to the top of the downcomer whence it travels down the downcomer to the bottom of the riser. if the injection of the gas is to effect circulation it is necessary that the entrained gas is removed from the aqueous medium between the top of the riser and the top of the downcomer. also, where the gas is utilised during the passage of the aqueous medium as it circulates, eg as in an aerobic fermentation or water treatment process, it is desirable to remove the spent gas bubbles, also any bubbles of gas, eg carbon dioxide, produced, from the aqueous medium before it passes to the downcomer. separation of the gas bubbles from the aqueous medium at the top of the riser may be effected by providing a pond or reservoir connecting the top of the riser to the top of the downcomer. during passage of the aqueous medium laterally through the pond from the

1. a process for liquid circulation and gas separation   wherein an aqueous medium is continuously circulated round apparatus comprising a downcomer connected at its base to a riser and bubbles of gas are injected into the aqueous medium in the downcomer and/or riser and bubbles of gas are removed from said aqueous medium between the top of the riser and the top of the downcomer characterised in that said gas bubbles are removed by passing the aqueous medium laterally through a pond connecting the top of the riser to the top of the downcomer and having submerged therein a separator comprising a plurality of spaced plates stacked one above another so that the aqueous medium passes through the spaces between the plates whereby the gas bubbles accumulate on the undersides of the plates, and venting said gas bubbles from beneath each plate to the surface of the pond.   2. a process according to claim 1 wherein the aqueous medium is a culture containing micro-organisms.   3. an apparatus for liquid circulation and gas separation which comprises a downcomer connected at its bottom to a riser, means for injecting gas into the downcomer and/or riser, a vessel connecting the top of the riser to the top of the downcomer, the inlet to said vessel from the top of the riser being laterally displaced from the outlet to the top of the downcomer, a separator disposed within said vessel, said separator comprising a plurality of spaced plates stacked one abdve anther so that an aqueous medium flowing in said vessel from said inlet to said outlet flows through the spaces between the plates, and means for venting gas bubbles accumulating on the undersides of each of said plates to the surface of the aqueous medium in said vessel.   4. an apparatus according to claim 3 wherein the separator comprises at least three plates.      an    anapparatus according to claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the plates are inclined to the vertical, in the direction of flow of the aqueous medium, by an angle between 300 and 1500.    6. an apparatus according to any one of claims 3 to 5 wherein  the plates are inclined to the horizontal in the direction transverse to the direction of flow of the aqueous medium by an angle between 100 and 600.   7. an apparatus according to claim 6 wherein the plates are bent or curved to have two or more angles of inclination to the transverse horizontal.   8. an apparatus according to claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the plates are of inverted - v configuration.   9. a process for liquid circulation and gas separation substantially as described herein and as shown in the accompanying drawings.   10. an apparatus for liquid circulation and gas separation substantially as described herein and as shown in the accompanying drawings.
