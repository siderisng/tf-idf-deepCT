<ABSTRACT>
1.  qrs detector for rectified qrs input signals (59), including automatic threshold value determination for devices for monitoring heart activity, in which detector the threshold value of the detector turn-on point can be automatically displaced as a function of the input signal (59) by an adjustment circuit which precedes the detector (56) which is constructed as a comparator or as an operational amplifier having at least two inputs (60, 61), which adjustments circuit comprises a low-pass filter (65, 62) which is connected to the one input (61) of the detector (56) is fed directly with the qrs signal which the same input signal is applied as the low-pass filter (62, 65 ; 62', 65), the intermediate tap of which divider in connected to the other input (60) of the detector (56), characterized in that - the input of the adjustment circuit (62, 65, 72, 73 ; 62', 65, 72, 73) preceding the detector (56) is fed directly with the qrs signal as a useful signal, which is a quantity signal obtained by two-way rectification, and with the noise component which is possibly super-imposed on this useful signal as a joint input signal (59), - on the one hand, the low-pass filter (62, 65 ; 62', 65) is dimensioned in such a manner that at its output connected to the one input (61) of the detector (56) the threshold value (63) occurs as the arithmetic means of the input signal (59), and that - on the other hand, the voltage divider (72, 73) is dimensioned in such a manner that a second signal (74) formed from the input signal (59) and having a relationship to the latter of 1/k=<2:pi occurs at the intermediate tap connected to the second input (60) of the detector (56), the peak amplitude of which second signal is less, in the case of periodic disturbances, as a result of the voltage dividing ratio of 1/k=<2:pi selected, than the associated threshold value occurring via the low-pass filter (62, 65 ; 62', 65) at the first input (61) of the detector (56).
