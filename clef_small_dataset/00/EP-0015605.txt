<ABSTRACT>
n-(2-methoxy-3-propylphenyl)-n-methylurea.  it is pre­ pared by reacting a compound of the formula ch₃x with  a compound of the formula    in which one of x und y represents an isocyanate group  and the other represents an amino group.  this compound has herbicidal properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
"novel urea derivative, a process for its preparation, herbicidal composition containing it, a method of combating undesired plant growth using it" the invention relates to a novel urea derivative, a process for its preparation, herbicidal composition containing it, a method of combating undesired plant growth using it. us patent specification no. 2655447 discloses an extremely large class of urea derivatives which can be used as herbicides. said specification, however, contains no suggestion that such ureas have any selective action between weeds and crops. surprisingly, it has now been found that a specific urea derivative within the scope of said specification but not specifically disclosed therein, has useful selective herbicidal properties. the invention provides the compound n-(2-methoxy-3-propylphenyl)-n'-methylurea. the invention also provides a process for thespreparation of said compound, characterised in that a compound of the general formula ch3x is reacted with a compound of the general formula emi1.1 in which one of x and y represents an isocyanate group and the other represents an amino group. suitably the reaction is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent, for example an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 1000c, especially 15 to 0 t5 c. room temperature is generally convenient. the reaction is suitably performed in the presence of a base. this may be an excess of one of the reactants, especially when using methylamine as a reactant, or an additional base, for example an amine, may be added. it has been found that n-( 2-methoxy-3-propylphenyl )-n'- methylurea possesses useful herbicidal properties, controlling both broad-leaved and grassy weeds. in particular, it has been found that when it is applied pre-emergence (applied to the soil before the plants sprout) it kills such weeds at dosages at which it is only slightly toxic to wheat. it thus is of interest for controlling weeds in plantings of wheat. the invention therefore also provides a herbicidal composition which comprises the compound according to the invention together with a suitable carrier, and also provides a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus, which comprises applying to the locus the compound or a composition according to the invention. in particular, the compound or composition may be applied to a crop area sown with wheat, before the emergence of the wheat. the amount of the compound according to the invention, to be used in combating undesirable vegetation will naturally depend on the condition of the vegetation, the degree of activity desired, the formulation used, the mode of application, the climate, the season of the year, and other variables. recommendations as to precise amounts are, therefore, not possible. in general, however, application to the locus to be protected of from 0.1 to 10.0 kilograms per hectare of said compound will be satisfactory. a carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated,
