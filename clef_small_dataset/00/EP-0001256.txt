<ABSTRACT>
The continuous elastic network bandage consists of a knitted knife with elastic threads (11) as a chain and transversely to this extending unulastic threads (12) made of shot.To create a particularly lightweight and large-meshed network bonding without width shrinkage, it is provided that the chains of each other are independent fringe chains of inelastic threads (10), which are associated with an elastic plastic store, and the unulastic weft threads are always at the same location of the fringe chain, at whichAlso attacks the adjacent shot, and between the jumps of fringed chain to fringe chain several times stored on this arcuate.The fringe chain and the elastic plastic beads run parallel to each other and the weft threads at right angles to these.
