<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for receiving digital communication signals in a digi-valley switching point of a PCM time division multiplexer reporting network, which in the form of at least one subsequent signal word, optionally a signaling word and a predetermined synchronization word include the message signal blocks of digital subscribers are transmitted on subscriber connection lines . In order to meet the fluctuating phase position upon receipt of such message blocks, the first bit of such a block is determined by means of a signal evaluation device (2), then a phase-appropriate bit clock is selected and a synchronous counter (6) to zero by means of a clock selection circuit (5) posed. The counter generates enable signals for registers (8, 9, 10) for each parts of a block. A comparison (8a) checks for presence of a correct synchronizer word. Depending on the comparison result, the one settings with the occurrence of the next block will be brought back or further worked with the present setting. Application in PCM time division multiplexing systems with digital subscriber connections.
