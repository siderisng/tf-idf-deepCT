<ABSTRACT>
an hydraulic clutch (10) is provided, which is positively  engaged by hydraulic means (37, 39) and is disengaged by  mechanical means (49).  as shown in fig.  2, the clutch  includes a male cone member (52) carried for rotation on  an input shaft (16), and for limited axial sliding movement  therealong.  interconnection between the male cone  member and the input shaft is provided by a series of  elongated pins (60) carried in recesses (61, 62) formed in  the male cone member (52) and in the input shaft (16).  a  female cone member (50), formed integrally with an output  shaft (26), receives the male cone member (52) for driving  engagement.  when engagement is desired, a fluid pres­ sure piston (39) and a thrust plate (44) urge the male cone  member (52) axially along the input shaft (16) into driving  engagement with the female cone member (50).  a stop pin  (46) carried by the thrust plate (44) engages an abutment  for limiting the axial motion of the hydraulic piston (39)  and male cone member (52).  when disengagement is  desired, fluid pressure is released, and a resilient mechani­ cal device such as a set of springs (70) urges the male  cone member (52) out of engagment with the female cone  member (50).  a second mechanical device such as an addi­ tional set of springs (49) returns the thrust plate (44) and  piston (39) to their deactivated positions.
