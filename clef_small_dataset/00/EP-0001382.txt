<ABSTRACT>
procedure and installations for winning useful work and/or useful cold from heat by means of thermodynamic cyclic processes, in which the working gases are subjected to above all adiabatic but also isothermic and polytropic changes of state, above all in the temperature range between outside temperature and absolute zero.  the cooled, relieved working gases are, by means of outside heat, continuously heated to the starting temperature at starting pressure again.  the cold arising during the expansion can also be used as useful cold, for example in seawater desalination.  beyond the earth region, solar radiation energy is transformed into useful work in similar thermodynamic processes.  <image>
