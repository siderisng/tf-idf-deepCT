<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises, around a mixture distribution mouth (29, 30, 16, 15), a waterproof rotating enclosure 1 wherein an annular partition 20 separates two chambers 23, 24 communicating with each other by a peripheral passage 22, mainly containing the heavy phase and the separate light phase and having thresholds 32, 33 spill thereof. According to the invention, the two chambers are equipped with separate centrifuge devices 17 and 49, connected to rotational crossing devices 14 and 11 the animating at different angular speeds. The invention is applicable in particular to the extraction of animal and plant fatty bodies, to the extraction of essential oils, to the production of distracting animal protein, to the recovery of polymers in mixed water solvent, to the extraction of the Antibiotics, metallurgical refinctions by selective solvents, seawater desalting by solvent process, wastewater treatment, etc.
