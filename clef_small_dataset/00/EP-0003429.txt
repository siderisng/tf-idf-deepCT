<ABSTRACT>
when alkali metal aluminosilicates are heated with  calcium and/or magnesium chloride to a temperature at  which the latter is liquid reaction occurs with formation of a  liquid phase which is a glass.  when this glass is cooled and  leached with water the alkali metal can be recovered as the  corresponding chloride from the aqueous eluate.  since the  aluminosilicates occur naturally this provides a ready means  of recovering potassium and lithium from their aluminosilicates.   the reaction is also applicable to various kinds of  waste products such as fly ash.
