<ABSTRACT>
an electrical jack suitable for direct connection to a  printed circuit board which has an elongated nonconductive  housing (10) with a cylindrical opening (18) for insertion of a  plug and at least two wrap-around contact assemblies  extending generally transverse to the cylindrical opening  (18).  each contact assembly includes a first cantilevered  contact member (21, 22) having a free end (45, 60) movable  between a first and second position in response to insertion  and removal of the plug.  each contact assembly further  includes a second cantilevered contact member (23, 24)  having a free end adapted for electrical engagement with the  free end (45, 60) of the first contact member (21, 22).  the  respective contact portions (49) of the free ends of the first  and second contact members (21. . . 24) are disposed at an  angle with respect to the direction of movement of the  contact portions (21. . . 24) into and out of electrical engagement  with each other to increase the wiping action therebetween.
