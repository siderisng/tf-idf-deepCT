<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing extremely smaller, with impurities provided zones within other zones of doped zones, without requiring particularly critical masks. Within on the surface of a substrate mask layers (9, 10), a sub-cutting (15) is prepared for defining a first zone doped zone (24), such as the base zone of a bipolar transistor. After this zone is formed by insertion of interference elements, the distinction is filled by chemical precipitate from the vapor phase. Subsequently, for the formation of a second zone (36) doped with a fault element, in this case, the emitter zone, within the first zone, a barrier mask can be used. The opening of the second zone is defined by the filled edge strip, whereby a predetermined distance between the edges of the first and second doped zone is ensured. The same mask can also be used to form further, located within the first zone and thus automatically oriented zones.
