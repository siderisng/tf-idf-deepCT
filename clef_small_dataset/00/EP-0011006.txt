<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for coiling discharged sheared sheetmetal articles in the form of elongate strips, according to which the end of the strip (3) is engaged on a mandrel (7) provided with a hooking member (71) and driven to rotate about its axis for the formation of a coil (9) on the mandrel (7) and between two walls (56, 57) located at the ends of the latter perpendicularly to its axis, the coil (9) thus formed being removed as a result of the sliding of the mandrel (7) along its axis towards one of the walls (56) up to a retracted position for release of the coil (9), characterized in that, the mandrel (7) being stopped and placed in an intermediate starting position between the ejection position and the winding position, a certain quantity of strip (3) is first allowed to accumulate until an entangled bundle (31) forms in the vicinity of the mandrel, the said bundle (31) is then applied against the mandrel (7), and the latter is made to slide into the winding position in such a way that the hooking member (71) engages on the entangled bundle (31), the mandrel (7) being driven to rotate for the winding of the coil (9).
