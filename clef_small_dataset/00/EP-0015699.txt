<ABSTRACT>
in a method of manufacturing fire-lighters using a hot fire-­ lighter composition which sets when cool and which has an ad­ ditive in the form of combustible filler material, the filler material  is not added until after the hot fire-lighter composition has  been cooled or allowed to cool to a temperature which is  above its setting temperature.  this enables cooling time to be  reduced by an amount which makes it possible to manufacture  by a continuous process.

<DESCRIPTION>
fire hters and methods of manufacturing them: the invention relates to fire-lizhters and to methods of manufacturing them. the type of fire-lighter which has been in most general use up to the present time is the so-called white type which utilises an oil in water emulsion which is caused to set by the use of a catalyst. the setting time can be fairly rapid and the fire-lighters can hence be readily manufactured in quantity. however the quantity of paraffin utilised makes these white fire-lihters relatively expensive. more use is now therefore being made of the so-called brown type, which utilise a soap in oil emulsion or gel, the soap being made by the reaction of caustic soda and stearic acid. the emulsion or gel is used to bind together various additives including combustible filler material. the reaction between the caustic soda and the stearic acid takes place at a fairly high temperature, usually in excess of 160 0f. this means that when the mixture is poured into moulds it has a fairly long setting time, since it has to cool down, so the manufacturing rate is significantly lower than that of white fire-lighters. we have been carrying out research with a--view to reducing the time taken to manufacture brown fire-lighters, and have discovered that one reason why the hot mixture cools gradually is that the combustible filler materials, for example wood flour, are poor conductors of heat. accordingly the invention provides a method of manufacturing fire-lighters, comprising the steps of forming a hot fire-lighter composition which cools when set, cooling or allowing the composition to cool to a temperature which is above its setting temperature, and then adding combustible filler material to the composition. by keeping the combustible filler material separate from the hot composition while the composition cools, there is no retardant effect on the cooling of the composition, and so the composition cools more quickly than in known processes. furthermore, the combustible filler material, or other additives, may be chilled before they are mixed with the composition, thereby further accelerating cooling to the setting temperature. the method according to the invention has been developed for use with hot compositions comprising soap in paraffin emulsions or gels, but the method is also effective to increase production rates with any fire-lighter composition which must go through a hot stage followed by a cooling stage. other hot compositions may include tars, waxes, and other wax-like materials, stearine and other chemical residues, atactic polypropylene and other plastics wastes the combustible filler material may be a carbonaceous material such as wood flour. other materials may be used as an alternative or in addition, for example sawdust, sander dust, cork, peat, paper, bark, nut shells, husks, straw, lignite, coal, coke, solid smokeless fuels, carbonaceous residues. the filler may be in the form of particles, or pellets, or granules deriving therefrom. in addition to combustible additives, one or more inorganic materials may be added, to reduce cost, modify weight or performance and/or to assist further
