<ABSTRACT>
a convenient hard copy output for a cathod ray tube  (crt) display device is provided by a thermal printer which  prints a line of dots equal in number to the number of dots in  one raster scan or line on the crt screen.  the information is  printed during one such raster scan, in each refresh cycle of  the screen, until the entire screen content has been repro­ duced.  use of one line during each refresh cycle enables the  reproduction of the screen content by gating the serial data  from the display control circuitry without the need for a sepa­ rate character generator or related circuitry and also accom­ modates the use of an interlaced raster.

<DESCRIPTION>
display and recording apparatus this invention relates to display and recording apparatus previously when it has been desired to print the content of a display screen to provide a permanent hard copy it has been necessary to transfer the data content of the display to a memory and thereafter use the stored data as the basis for actuating a printer to generate a hard copy. this involved discrimination between displayable characters and other data, character generation and data manipulation for display or print in both devices thereby duplicating numerous functions. the printer display of the present invention provides a low cost, quiet, compact, single hard copy output of crt displayed information. using a line-of-dots thermal printer with a solid state print head, screen information is printed on-the-fly on thermally sensitive roll paper fed past the print head by a motor driven platen. the printer uses the same serial data that the display control circuitry transmits to the cathode ray tube for visual display. one line of data is gated to the print buffer and printed during each refresh cycle by a line of thermal print dots equal in number to the number of dots in each raster scan line of data. the printer thereby prints the content of the display screen without the necessity of duplicating the character generator circuit and other circuitry for preparation of data in serial-bit form. the printer is also insensitive to whether the scan data is from a device that scans raster lines sequentially or utilizes an interlaced raster. in addition the all points addressable characteristic of the printer affords versatile printing capability as the device is able to reproduce graphics with the same ease as characters or symbols, allowing for ease in interface and attachment. accordingly the invention provides apparatus for displaying an image represented by a serial sequence of data, said apparatus comprising a crt display device including control circuitry for deriving from said serial data control signals for controlling the crt to cause the display device to display the image; dot printing means operable to print dots at selected positions in a matrix of dot positions covering an image receiving area of a record medium; and connecting circuitry connecting the printer to the display device and operative to supply the crt control signals as control signals to the printer to cause the printer to print the image displayed by the crt display device. preferably the printing means is a thermal printer or an electro-erosion printer. the invention also provides in combination with a crt display device of the type wherein serial raster data is provided on a line basis to a crt screen, a thermal printer for printing the screen display information on a thermo graphic medium comprising thermal print means including a row of thermal print elements having a print element for each dot position of a raster scan row on said crt screen, print control circuit means for actuating said thermal print elements of said thermal print means, and gating
