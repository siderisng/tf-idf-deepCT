<ABSTRACT>
a photoelectric smoke detector of the light scattering  type uses for synchronizing the pulse-wise operated light  source (4) and the light receiving element (6) a flip-flop circuit  (r. s-ff) which is set when scattered light is received at the  same time when the light source is lit, but is reset when no  light scattering is occuring at this time.  an alarm signal is  produced through a quick-reset integration circuit (i) only  when a number of scattered light pulses are received subseÂ­ quently originating from a fire.  no false alarm is given by  electric or light noise or cigarette smoke clouds.  this smoke  detector is preferably used as fire alarm.

<DESCRIPTION>
smoke detector this invention relates to a photoelectric smoke detector comprising a light source operating at predetermined intervals and a light receiving element actuating an alarm circuit when light scattered by smoke is received synchronously with the operation of the light source at said predetermined intervals. photoelectric smoke detectors with these characteris=ics may especially be used as fire alarms. in a detector of this type which produces a fire ala=m signal by detecting light scattered by smoke particles generated by a fire, in order to reduce current consump- tion and non-genuine alarms, a light source is emitting visible light, infrared or ultraviolett radiation periodically and a light receiving element is synchronized with the light source. a fire alarm signal is generated when the output of the light receiving element exceeds a predetermined threshold value. a circuit of this kind is already known by the japanese patent no. 519 362 (publication no. sho 43-51). though the above-mentioned detector has the merit to remarkably reduce non-genuine alarms, there is still a fair possibility of producing a false alarm by single electric noise or a flash light etc. synchronized with the light source. furthermore an alarm may be caused by clouds of cigarette smoke etc. even if no fire is existing. it is an object of the invention to avoid the abovementioned defects of prior art and to obtain a detector which does not operate on electric noise or noise light s'-rc'rronized with the light source, and which is not in ; fenced by cigarette smoke. the invention is characterized by the fact that the alarm circuit is actuated through a flip-flop circuit which is set when the light source and the light receiving element are delivering an output signal at the same time and which is reset when the light source is delivering an output signal and at the same time the light receiving element is delivering an output signal an embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings. fig. 1 shows a circuit diagram of a smoke detector according to this invention. fig. 2 shows time diagrams at various points of this circuit. in the embodiment of the invention shown in fig. 1, a light source ld, e.g. consisting of a light emission diode, is arranged in a dark chamber to which smoke may enter freely and is lit periodically with a period t and a pulse width t controlled by an oscillation circuit os, e.g. consisting of a put or an equivalent circuit. a light receiving element sb, e.g. consisting of a solar battery, is so arranged in the dark chamber that in normal condition no light can reach the light receiving element directly and it receives only the light scattered by smoke particles in the dark chamber. an amplifiercircuit am, e.g. consisting of an operational amplifier1 amplifies the output of the light receiving element sb, and its output terminal is connected with a wave form shaping circuit a which, as occasion demands, shapes the output
