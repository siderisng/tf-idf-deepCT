<ABSTRACT>
In a spray head (29) on a metallic support (3, 4), a plastic top (1) is extruded as a printing carrier. The plastic top (1) is particularly polyurethane or thermoplastic poly ester; The metallic support (3,4) is formed in particular of braided or coiled wire layers. This metallic support (3, 4) has a closed inside soul (2) made of plastic. These inner souls (2) consists in particular from a polymer or thermoplastic art fabric. The metallic carrier (3, 4) is biased and heated approximately to the temperature of the extrudate or the spray head. As a result, a radially directed bias voltage is generated in the inner soul (2). The material of the inner soul (2) presses under softening at least partially through the openings of the carrier outward. Around the carrier, a vacuum is applied between the quill (26) and hose (19), so that the bias voltage directed radially outwardly directed in the inner soul is tested. The upper ceiling is applied simultaneously or UNITBAR after applying the vacuum to the carrier. In this case, the material of the upper ceiling connects intimately with the material of the inner souls penetrating by the openings of the carrier.
