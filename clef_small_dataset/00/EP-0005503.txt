<ABSTRACT>
a nodal switching network is disclosed wherein each  node is connected to distant nodes by groups of links whose  lengths are ordered to span distances definable by powers of  a finite (preferably binary) integer.  starting at the calling  node, a single idle link in a preferred coordinate direction is  attempted to be seized to extend the connection as far as  possible by a direct path.  if a direct path link spanning the  most of the distance in the preferred coordinate direction  cannot be seized, a direct path link is attempted to be seized  in another coordinate direction.  if no link which would  extend the connection most efficiently in either coordinate  direction can be seized, links of less direct length in the  coordinate directions are tested.  if the call is still blocked, the  procedure is repeated in the direction from the called node  toward the calling node.
