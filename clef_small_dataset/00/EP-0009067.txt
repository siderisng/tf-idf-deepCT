<ABSTRACT>
1.  a tubular tyre for automobile vehicles, of the type comprising an inflatable tubular air chamber (1), a belt (2), a winding (3) of the radial tyre, a rim band (4), rubber wall elements (23, 28), a tread (6) and two semi-rigid circular wires (7) disposed at the edges of the belt (2), characterized in that the rim band (4) has a width / of between 0. 25 l and 0. 35 l, wherein l represents the total width of the tread (6), in that the cross-section of the tyre has in a known manner a ratio h/l of between 0. 5 and 0. 6, wherein h represents the total height between the rim band (4) and the tread (6) and in that, seen in cross-section, each side wall (5) of the tyre has, in the area of the winding (3) or of the inner rubber wall element (23), a profile which corresponds to the upper portion of the curve (e) representing the meridian profile of a conventional radial tyre and defined by the equilibrium equation :  see diagramm : ep0009067,p11,f1  wherein a is the ordinate of the crown point of the meridian profile, measured from the axis of rotation of the tyre, and b is the ordinate of the point of maximum width of the said meridian profile, the said upper portion being comprised substantially between the points (c) and (d) of this curve (e) where the tangents are vertical and horizontal respectively, the assembly being such that the tyre, seen in cross-section, substantially forms an isostable triangular system.
