<ABSTRACT>
indicator apparatus for determining the miss distance or  shortest distance of a projectile (3) in relation to a fixed or  moving target (2), comprising pressure-sensing transducers  (5), intended to sense the pressure wave generated by the  projectile in at least four points, and means for generating  corresponding electrical signals therefrom.  the apparatus  further comprises computer circuits, calculating the distance  to the point of origin of the wave, i. e.  the so-called "bang  generation point", in response to the characteristics of the  pressure wave.  one object is to indicate the shortest distance  between the projectile and target and the exact position of  the projectile when it is at this shortest distance from the  target.  in the indicator apparatus, the direction of the  trajectory is calculated by means of said at least four  pressure transducers arranged at the corners of a polyhedron.   by measuring the time differences for the passage of the  pressure wave past the pressure transducers in the transducer  system, the exact position of the bang generation point  can be given in relation to the pressure transducer system  from these time differences and the measured distance to  the point.  the indicator apparatus also comprises a second  transducer system which can sense either the height of the  first pressure transducer system above a horizontal plane, or  the passage of the pressure wave at a further instant.  from  these data the computer circuits can give the trajectory  direction which, together with the bang generation point  gives the required trajectory.  for shooting at fixed targets,  the computer circuits give a second point on the trajectory  which, together with the bang generation point, gives the  trajectory perse.
