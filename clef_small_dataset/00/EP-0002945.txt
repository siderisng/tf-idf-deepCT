<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method of making a parallax  stereogram, i. e. , free vision stereogram, and particularly  for the accurate registration of a plurality of film images  in order to ensure stereographic reproduction.  each film  frame having the image thereon includes marks which are  used in a projection printing apparatus (13) to register the  image in a desired position.  the registration is accomplished  by mechanical alignment according to the mark or  by optically sensing the mark.  a comparator-servo can  adjust the film frame to the desired position.  after registration  each film frame is exposed onto a photosensitive  material (95) using a movable line grid (97).  a lenticular  screen is superimposed over the developed picture to  form the stereoscopic photograph.
