<ABSTRACT>
when an elastomeric copolymer of a c₄ or c₅ conjugated  diene and an aromatic vinyl compound is brominated as a  latex while keeping the uniformity of the latex until the  amount of bromine combined with the copolymer reaches  0. 5 - 15% by weight, the resulting brominated conjugated  diene-aromatic vinyl compound rubber typically contains 3 -  80% by weight of a toluene-insoluble fraction formed by the  bromination and typically has a high green strength and a  good processability.  a vulcanized rubber obtained from such  a brominated rubber has a high modulus of elasticity and a  high tensile strength.  when an anionic surfactant is used as  an emulsifier, the uniformity of the above-mentioned latex  can be kept by adjusting the ph of the bromination reaction  system to 9 or higher, preferably 10 or higher, during the  reaction or by adding a nonionic surfactant.  when a cationic  or nonionic surfactant is used as an emulsifier, regulation of  ph is unnecessary.
