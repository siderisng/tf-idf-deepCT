<ABSTRACT>
direction indicating apparatus for a vehicle having at  least front and rear indicator lamps (8, 9) which are  connected in parallel with each other to be energized by a  battery (12) through a current detecting resistor (10), a relay  (6) and a direction selector switch.  the relay (6) is energized  to close periodically in response to periodic pulse so that the  indicator lamps flash periodically.  generation of the periodic  pulses is controlled in response to the voltages appearing  across the current detecting resistor (10) and at the junction  between the relay (6) and the direction selector switch.  the  relay (6) is adapted to serve as an alarm buzzer to warn of  malfunction of both front and rear indicator lamps.
