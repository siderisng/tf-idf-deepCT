<ABSTRACT>
a microcontrolier for controlling the transfer of data  between external units, e. g.  disc files and a file control unit  includes an input port (8) and an output port (9).  the inÂ­ put port is arranged selectively to connect any one of a  plurality of input busses to a bus (15) and the output port  is arranged selectively to connect bus (15) to any one of a  plurality of output busses.  bus (15) comprises part of a  loop system which passes through input (a) of alu 70,  output (80) of the alu, alu register (71) and gated driver  (110).  a read-only store (52) controls the system through  instruction register decoder (53), and also the input and  output ports by means of an external address decoder (26).   data transfer takes place in one machine cycle, in the first  port of a cycle the external address decoder selects the  input port and a line connection in that port, in a second  port of the cycle, the output port and a line connection  therein are selected.  the read-only store is addressed  through registers (50a and 50b) either in sequence by  employing counters (51a and 51b), by gating outputs from  the alu through driver (111) or by gating outputs from a  random access memory (38) through driver (111).
