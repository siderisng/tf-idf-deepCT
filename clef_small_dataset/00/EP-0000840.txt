<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a composition for a friction material,  e. g.  for a brake lining or clutch facing, of the type containing  a fibrous reinforcement, a binder and various additives.  the friction material contains no asbestos, but has properties  comparable with asbestos-based materials.  the composition  contains a thermoset binder, which may be based on  a phenol-formaldehyde resin, or a heat and chemical resistant  rubber, the binder making up 15 to 40% by volume of the  material.  the fibrous reinforcement is a mixture of an inorganic  fibre selected from metal fibres, e. g.  steel glass fibre,  mineral wools manufactured from slags or naturally occuring  rocks such as basalt, silica fibres and ceramic fibres of the  alumino silicate type; with at least one organic fibrous material  such as wood pulp, jute, sisal, cotton.  70 to 4% by volume of the material consists of the fibrous  reinforcement, preferably 50 to 10% by volume.  the inorganic  fibrous material is the main reinforcement of the friction material,  the organic fibrous material providing integrity and  strength during manufacture.
