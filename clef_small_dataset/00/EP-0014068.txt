<ABSTRACT>
an orthopedic reclining chair is reclinable to a posi­ tion in which the body of the occupant is substan­ tally inverted, the occupant being retained in the chair by  means of a lap belt (8) engaging the upper surface of the  thighs whereby to support the weight of the head and torso  through the hip joints so as to apply traction to the spine  of the occupant.  preferably the seating unit (2) comprises  an integral backrest (10) and seat (12), together with a  support (14) for the lower portions of the legs, the seating  unit (2) being rockably suspended from a frame relative to  which it may be pulled rearwardly from an equilibrium se­ mi-reclining position to its substantially inverted position.
