<ABSTRACT>
partially unsaturated polymers are dissolved in a two  component solvent comprising a first component having a  reactivity toward ozone less than carbon-carbon double  bonds but more reactive than carbon-carbon single bonds  and a second component being inert toward ozone.  introduc­ tion of ozone into the solution produces ozonides which are  readily cleft into difunctional aliphatic species that can be  converted to e. g.  carboxy-terminated or multifunctional car­ boxy substituted aliphatic compounds.  these may be used  as monomeric species in various polymerization schemes as  such, in preparation of polyamides, for example, or may be  reduced to aldehydes or alcohols to be used in the prepara­ tion of such polymers as polyesters, polyurethanes, poly  (schiff bases), etc.  the carboxylated products may also be  employed as ionomers, which are useful as surfactants.  mo­ nocarboxyl terminated polyethylene having a number aver­ age molecular weight of from about 4,000 to 100,000 are  provided.  poly(carboxymethyl) substituted polyethylenes,  wherein from about 0. 05 to 1. 3 percent of the hydrogen atom  of polyethylene are substituted with carboxymethyl groups,  are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
description production of ozonides from unsaturated polymers field of the invention this invention relates to a process for producing functional or multifunctional monomers from long chain partially unsaturated polymers by an ozonization process and to certain novel ozonides obtained thereby. s ummary of the invention in accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for selectively ozonizing the carboncarbon double bonds of an olefinically unsaturated organic polymer also containing carbon-carbon single bonds. the polymer is dissolved in a two-component -solvent system. the first component is less reactive than the polymer double carbon-carbon bonds but more reactive than said single carbon-carbon bonds toward ozone. the second component is substantially inert to ozone under the reaction conditions. the solution is contacted with ozone containing gas. the ozonides formed may then be cleaved to produce more stable products. starting polymers with partial unsaturation are formed by copolymerization of dienes or by addition reactions to unsaturated polymers or by elimination reactions of saturated polymers. they include high molecular weight polymers which may contain as backbone two or more of the structures emi2.1 where r1, r2, r3 r4 and r4 are independently for each substructure hydrogen, halogen, alkyl-substituted amino, oxy, peroxy or hydroxy radicals, ether groups, hydrocarbon, radicals or substituted hydrocarbon radicals; and r4 and r4 together can be oxo or thio; r5 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical, substituted hydrocarbon radical, ether radical, divalent sulfide, sulfone and the like, divalent nitrogen and the like; emi2.2 [-o-r6-o-] where r6 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical or substituted hydrocarbon radical, divalent sulfide, sulfone and the like, divalent nitrogen radical and the like. the backbone chains have end groups including one or more of the structures emi2.3 wherein r1, r2, r3 are independently hydrogen, halogen, alkyl-substituted amino, peroxy or hydroxy radicals, ether groups, hydrocarbon radicals or substituted hydrocarbon radicals and where r1 and r2 together can be oxo or thio radicals. the ozonolysis method of the present invention is distinguished from the methods described in the prior art by (1) being confined to the double bonds, and complete attack thereof and (2) the absence of the thermally unstable reactive sites in the molecule of the reaction product. the second characteristic is verified by lack of color in the resulting melt polymerization products. a relatively low molecular weight carboxy terminated polymer is prepared by ozonization and following cleavage from a copolymer containing the required amount and distribution of double bonds along the chain for yielding the desired molecular weight of the ozonized product. for long chain polymer starting materials without branching or pendant unsaturation a reaction product results with not more than two reactive sites per molecule. this is observable through complete lack of cross-linking during such polymerization reactions as melt polyesterification or polyamidation. for the preparation of ionomers, the diacids [or in case of starting materials containing either branches or pendant unsaturation, polyacids] are subsequently reacted with a base to yield the corresponding salts. certain of the ozonides produced by the process of this invention are novel compounds
