<ABSTRACT>
a flexible, highly resilient, cold-cure, closed-mold  polyurethane foam can be produced by reacting a foamable  mixture comprising an organic isocyanate, water and a  polyol.  the foams of the invention are preferably prepared  from a mixture of a hydroxyl-terminated graft copolymer and  a hydroxyl-terminated polyoxyalkylene polyether in the  presence of a co-catalyst mixture of at least one tertiary  amine catalyst and at least one metal-containing basic  catalyst.  said catalyst is selected from the group consisting  of an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide,  an inorganic basic salt thereof derived from the reaction  of said hydroxides with a weak inorganic acid, a metal  organic basic salt catalyst derived from the reaction of at  least one of said hydroxides with an organic acid and  mixtures thereof.  useful metal organic catalysts are selected  from the group consisting of the alkali and alkaline earth  metal carboxylates, alkoxides and phenates.  useful inorganic  basic metal salt catalysts are sodium bicarbonate and  sodium carbonate.
