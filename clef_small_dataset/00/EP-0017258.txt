<ABSTRACT>
subject matter of the invention is a tyre for vehicle  wheels, comprising a radial carcass, a tread and an annular  reinforcing structure inserted between the said carcass and  said tread and being substantially circumferentially inextenÂ­ sible and at least as wide as the tread.  for providing  favorable transversal and circumferential rigidity in the  zones of the sidewalls of the type - particularly of a high  speed tyre - there are arranged in each sidewall a mixed  textile-metallic reinforcement (14), comprised by two skirts  (15, 16) of textile cords having different widths, the cords of  said skirts being inclined with respect to the radial direction  of the carcass cords, and by a strip (17) of metallic cord also  inclined with respect to said radial direction and having a  lesser width to that of said greater width skirt (15) and  inserted in between said skirts (15, 16).
