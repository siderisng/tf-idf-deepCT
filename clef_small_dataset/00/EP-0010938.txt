<ABSTRACT>
polyamide molding resins are prepared by melt-­ blending (a) a polyamide resin, (b) a hydroxyl-functional  elastomer and (c) a succinic functional coupling agent,  the amount of (a) being from about 50% to about 97% of  the total weight of (a), (b) and (c), the amount of (b) being  from about 3% to about 50% of the total weight of (a), (b)  and (c), and the amount of (c) being an amount, usually  from about 0. 1% to about 10% of the total weight of (a),  (b) and (c), effective to couple the polyamide and hydroxyl-­ functional elastomer when melt-blended therewith, to form  a composition having greater impact strength than the  polyamide alone and the polyamide plus the elastomer.   the invention includes a composition which, on melt-­ blending, gives the molding resin, and also a molded  resin product made from the molding resin.
