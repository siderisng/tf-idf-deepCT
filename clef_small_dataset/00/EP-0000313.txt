<ABSTRACT>
a supercharging pump and a diffuser for this, for the atomisation of the fluid, comprising a shell (1) which has an inlet (13) at one of its ends and the other end of which retains, with the possibility of movement towards the inlet (13), a diffuser (28) with a port (34) shut off by a shutter (36) which moves for opening purposes in the direction of the inlet (13).  the port (34) opens into a first chamber (52) contained between the diffuser (28) and a flexible sealing diaphragm (24) which is fastened to it by its periphery (5) and which is fixed to a piston (20) subdividing the interior of the shell (1) into a compartment (65) on the one hand and on the other hand into a second chamber (56), called a compression chamber, not communicating with the compartment (65), but communicating with the first chamber (52) via a passage (38), this piston (20) being fixed to the shutter (36) which also shuts off the inlet (13) and which is stressed towards the said other end by a spring (43) calibrated in such a way that, beyond a given pressure threshold for the fluid, the diaphragm (24) is moved towards the inlet (13), at the same time shifting the shutter (36) away from the port (34).  <image>
