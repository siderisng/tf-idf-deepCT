<ABSTRACT>

<DESCRIPTION>
finely powdered fibroin and process for producing sdame this invention relates to finely powdered high-purity fibroin and a process for producing the same. powdered silk fibroin is considered to be useful as an additive for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations, because of its moderate moisture absorption and retention properties and its high affinity for the human skin. currently available silk fibroin powders are generally produced by finely dividing silk thread with a pulverizer. such a silk fibroin powder consists of filamentous fibers cut in very short lengths rather than nearly globular particles and, when used as aii additive for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations, gives rise to various difficulties. for example, in mixing the powder with other ingredients in globular form, it is so liable to aggregation that a homo- geneous final product is hardly obtained. even is such a product is obtained, it shows poor slip properties upon application to the human kin and may occasionally produce round agglomerates of silk fibroin. thus, it can be said that these difficulties prevent us from making good use of the excellent properties of silk fibroin with this background the present inventors haze made repeated studies on the production of a homogeneous fine powder of fihrei: n ,lobu ulur particulate form rather t:lan in fibrous form. in this field of art, for example process for producin silk fibroin suitable f±r use chromatography is disclosed in japanese patent publication no. l941/'64. his process comprises dissolving silk fibroin in a cuproammonium solution or a solution of a copper con.plex (for example, a cupri-ethylenediamine solution) , neutralizing the resulting solution with an acid, and then adding an alcohol to the neutralized solution to forw a white precipitate of silk fibroin. as a result of confirmatory tests made by the present inventors, it has been found that this process requires 2 ve:y large amount of alcohol and, moreover, the resulting pores state is too sticky to be separated b filtration. another process for producing a powder of silk fibroin is disclosed in japanese patent publication no. 4947/'51 this process comprises dissolving degummed silk fiber in a concentrated aqueous solution of a neutral salt such as calcium nitrate, dialyzing the resulting solution, and.spray- drying the colloidal solution so formed. however, the powder of silk fibroin thus obtained is abnormally hydrophilic and, therefore, unsuitable for use as an additive for cosmetic preparatiolls . in addition, there have been proposed other processes which involves hydrolysing silk thread with an acid or alkali to prepare a silk fibroin solution and then precipitating the silk fibroin either by neutralization or by the addition of ¯ ¯ an alcohol. in the fine powders of silk fibroin produced by these processes, however, the molecular weight is reduced to those of oligomers and the characteristic properties of silk are completely lost. x-ray diffraction analysis and infrared spectroscopic analysis have revealed that, in the conventional fine powders of silk fibroin produced by various processes involving tion of silk fibroin, the silk fibroin molecules contained therein have either
