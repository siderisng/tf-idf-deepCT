<ABSTRACT>
The modem comprises a transmitter (10) comprising an oscillator (22) which provides a carrier at the frequency, a modulator (24) and a mixer (28), a receiver (14) comprising a mixer (36) and a filter toNarrow band (40), and a frequency synthesizer (18).To test the latter, the circuit (20) controls the synthesizer (18) so that it generates a signal having a frequency equal to (2 + p) fi, P positive non-zero integer, and the switches (50), (52) and (54) are put in position II.The presence of a component at the output frequency of the mixer (36) is indicative of the correct operation of the synthesizer (18).
