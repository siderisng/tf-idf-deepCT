<ABSTRACT>
thermal polymerization of (npciâ‚‚)3,4 is improved by  conducting the polymerization in the presence of ziegler  type catalysts, namely compounds of the transition metals:  ti, zr, hf, v, nb, ta, cr, mo or w, with or without the  presence of compounds of b or al as cocatalysts.

<DESCRIPTION>
catalysis of phosphazene cyclics to polymer, using ziegler type catalysts background of the invention this invention relates to improvements in the conversion of low molecular weight cyclopolydichlorophosphazenes to higher molecular weight linear polydichlorophosphazenes. more particularly, it relates to the use of suitable catalysts in order to improve the above polymerization by increasing the rate of polymerization, while decreasing or entirely eliminating the formation of gel and by permitting better control of the molecular weight and other physical properties of the polymer produced. thermal polymerization of (npc12)n where n is a small integer such as 3 or 4 are described in allcock et al, united states patent 3,370,020 issued february 20, 1968 and in rose, united states patent 3,515,688 issued june 2, 1970 and elsewhere in the literature. in scaling-up such methods of thermal polymerization from laboratory size glass apparatus to pilot plant and semi-works installations, the polymerization vessels have been fabricated from stainless steels because of the relatively high temperatures utilized in the polymerization. an undesired consequence of the use of stainless steel equipment has been the contamination of the polymerization mixture with small amounts of metals such as chromium, nickel and iron which have significant but unpredictable effects on the manner in which the polymerization proceeds. these and other-objects of the invention will be pointed out or will be apparent from the description which follows. it has been found that the desired polymerization of cyclic dichlorophosphazenes to linear polydichlorophosphazenes can be effected at lower temperatures and at a more rapid rate by the use-of ziegler type compounds of ti, zr, hf, v, nb, ta, cr, mo or w as catalysts. it has also been found that the catalyzed polymerizations in glass or in stainless steel vessels proceed without the formation of gel, and that the molecular weight of the product can be controlled conveniently by varying the concentration of catalyst. it has further been found that some control over the molecular weight distribution of the resulting polymer can be achieved by incremental addition of the catalyst and/or of the cyclic oligomers to the polymerization apparatus. ziegler type catalysts suitable for the present invention are generally produced by preparing suitable compounds of one or more transition elements of groups iv, v or vi, particularly metal halides, metal hydrides or metal alkyls of the transition element. it appears that transition elements which form compounds with incomplete d-shells and are in the lower valence states can associate metal alkyls to form complexes with highly polarized bonds. particularly preferred catalysts for the present invention are compounds of ti, zr, hf, v, nb, ta, cr, mo and w wherein at least some of the metal is present in a valence state of 3 or below, or is associated with a sufficient amount of a reducing agent, capable of lowering the valence of such metal to the lower valence state. metals, metal hydrides, metal alkyls or aryls and grignard reagents are examples of the reducing agents which may be present to lower the valence of
