<ABSTRACT>
2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenones of  formula:    in which r is an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,  and r₁ and r₂ taken together form a 5 to 6 member heterocyclic  ring free of carbonyl substituents and including the  nitrogen atom, or are independent hydrogen atoms or alkyl  groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, provided that r₁ and  r₂ are not simultaneously hydrogen, are described.  they  are prepared by reaction of a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone  with an amine and formaldehyde.  the  compounds can be used, alone or in combination with  other stabilisers, to prevent photodegradation of organic  materials, particularly as light stabilisers for synthetic resins.  5,5-methylene bis(2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-benzophenone)  of formula:    wherein r ist an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms is  prepared by condensation of a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxy-5-aminomethylbenzophenone  with itself or with a 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone.   this compounds also are useful to  prevent photodegradation of organic materials, particularly  as stabilisers for synthetic resins.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for preparation a 5,5'-hethylenebis(2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone) background of the lavencton this invention relates to 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone ultraviolet radiation absorbing compounds, to a process for preparing such compounds, to synthetic resins stabilized against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation by incorpotating in such resins small quantittes of such compounds, and to stabilizer compositions comprising such compounds in combination with a known polymer stabilizer. certain 2-hydroxy-4-alkoxybenzophenone compounds are known to be effective ultraviolet absorbers and light stabilizers, with the 2 -hydroxyl group critically necessary for effectiveness. these are among a large number of classes of compounds disclosed in the patent literature as nesting the requirements for an effective u!traviolet radiation absorber. in lieu of individual references. the review by c. w. lappin in " encyclopedia of polymer science and technology " (n. bikales, ed. new york, john wiley-interscience. 19?1) vol. 14, pages 125 to 148 can be consulted. according to lappin's review, the 18 2-hydroxybenzophenone compounds indicated to be in commercial use as stabilizers are low to moderate molecular weight compounds having a single benzophenone unit in the molecule. lappin refers to problems of "compatibility" of the additive stabilizer with the polymer being stabilized, including such propertles as the solubility of the addiriverin the polymer, the rate of difusion of the additive through the polymer. and the rate of loss of the additive from the polymer. lappin characterizes compatibility as " a sensitlq function of molecular structure and not entirely prodictable". among attempts to improve on the comercially available 2-hydroxybenzophencnss, lappin indicates that longer outdoor life of polymers might be obtained with relatively high molecular weight ultraviolet radiation absorbers and states that attempts to utilize polymeric and polymerizable absorbers for this purpose had given ambiguous results and not been commercially successful. subsequent attempts to overcome the inadequacies of the conventional ultraviolet absorber stabilizers include a number of disclosures of 2hydroxybenzophenones having either a plurality of benzophenone units in the molecule or functional group substitution in addition to hydroxyl and alkoxyl. thus, lappin in u.s. patent 3,310,525 of march 21, 1967 disclosed alpha-omega-bis(2-hydroxybenzoyl)alkane stabilizers for polyesters and poly-alpha-olefin resins, having a formula emi2.1 wherein n is an integer in a range from 2 to 8, and x, y and z are independently selected from the group of hydrogen, c1-c4 alkoxy and cl-c4 alkyl radicals. h. dressler in u.s. patent 3,399,237 of august 27, 1968 disclosed ultraviolet light stabilizing derivatives of 4-benzoylresorcinol having the formula emi2.2 wherein z is a member selected from the group consisting of sulfur and emi2.3 and r is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl having from 1-11 carbon atoms. m. minagawa in japan kokai 74 78,692 of july 29, 1974 disclosed 2hydroxybenzophenone derivatives carrying cyclic imide substituents linked to the 4-position of the 2-hydroxybenzophenone by an alkyleneoxy group, for example 4-(2-phthalimidethoxy)-2-hydroxybenzophenone. m. minagawa in japan kokai 75 74579 of june 19, 1975 disclosed 2hydroxybenzophenone derivatives having from 2 to 7 hydroxybenzophenone units linked through such bivalent groups as methylene, methyleneoxymethylene, cyclohexylidene, sulfide, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, alkylidene, carboxyalkylidene,
