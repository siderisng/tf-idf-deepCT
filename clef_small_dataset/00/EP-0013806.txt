<ABSTRACT>
a dictating and transcribing system includes a cartridge  (70) carrying a plurality of individual recording media, such as  tape cassettes, and a means for selectively positioning the car­ tridge with respect to a record/listen transducer (66) to place  any one of the recording media in a recording position.  auto­ matic access and re-access to any of the recording media may  be obtained during dictation or transcription without manual  handling of individual recording media.  the cartridge is prefer­ ably rotatably driven about its center and slidably receives the  recording media in locations radially disposed about the center  of the cartridge.
