<ABSTRACT>
an aid for the blind and visually handicapped has a  pistol grip at one end of straight member 10 carrying spaced  ground wheels 22 on downwardly inclined end element 18.  a  linkage 7 is pivoted on element 18 and carries lateral resilient  probes 34, 35 which can be retracted to lie rearwards by  sliding knob 45 to operate linkage 7.  a user holds the grip  whilst walking and can sense changes in ground level and  texture and vertical obstacles which deflect the probes.  on  release the probes return to their operative, lateral, position.

<DESCRIPTION>
ail)s for tke blind and visually handicapped and use theri:of this invention relates to aids for use by blind and other visually handicapped persons. it is known for a blind person when walking forwards to use an aid in the form or a so-called long stick, which is straight and in some cases can be collapsed for transport. the user, whilst walking forwards, holds the stick downwardly and forwardly, and swings the stick from side to side to sense vertical obstacles, and also taps on the ground to sense changes in ground level, e.g. a road kerb, it will be appreciated that unlese forward progress is very slow, some vertical obstacles and changes in ground level will be missed and in general a user will restrict his forward speed to a level which enables most obstacles to be sensed. prolonged use of the stick can produce fatigue in the user's arm according to this invention an aid for the blind and visually handicapped comprises an elongate member, ground engaging roller means for the elongate member, and probe means extending transversely of the elongate member for detecting obstacles. with such an aid, obstacles and ground changes can be sensed by a user. the invention also includes a method or walking using such an aid with the elongate member extending torwards. preferably probe means are adapted to extend laterally of the elongate member, the probe means being deflectable and on release arranged to return to its lateral position. with such an aid, a user can rendily sense vertical obstacles and changes in ground level on a continuous basis whilst moving forwardly. the aid is most effective if there are two probes adapted to extend laterally respectively on both sides of the elongate member if the roller means comprises two laterally spaced rollers this is particularly useful in locating the elongate member at right angles to a step or kerb in one embodiment the probes are inherently resilient and comprise a plastics tube with an inner <rti id=2.15> fibre glass rod. preferably, for ease of transport and convenience on buses and the like, the probe means is retractable to a which position/extends generally towards the other end of th & elongate member. conveniently the probe means ii retracted through a linkage connected to an operating element by a rod extending along the elongate member, and releasable detents are preferably provided to resist undesired retraction and extension of the probe means. the invention may be performed in various ways and two specific embodiment with possible modifications will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: fig.1 is a perspective view of an aid for blind or other visually handicapped persons; fig.2 is an enlarged perspective view of part of the aid; fig.3 is a part section of part of the aid; fig .4 is a section on the line 4-4 of fig.3; fig.5 is a side view, part in section, of an end of a probe; and

   claims:    emi12.1         1. an aid for the blind and visually handicapped comprising an elongate member characterised in that ground engaging roller means (22)   provided    for the elongate member, and probe means adapted to extend transversely of the elongate member for detecting obstacles.   2. an aid as claimed in claim 1, in which the roller means (22) and probe means (34, 35) are at one   end    region of the elongate member.   3. an aid as claimed in claim   i    or claim 2, in wich the probe means (34, 35) is adapted to extend laterally of the   elongate    member   (i 0)    the probe means being   deflectable    and on release arranged to return to its lateral position.   4. an aid as claimed in claim 3, in which the probe means comprises two elongate deflectable probes adapted to extend respectively laterally to the two sides of the elongate member and arranged when released to return to their lateral positions.      5.      an    aid as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, in which the probe means has a replaceable tip portion   (40):      6.    an aid as claimed in claim   5,    in which the tip portion (40) includes a tactile marker (42).     7. an aid as claimed in any of claims 3 to 6, in which the probe means has inherent resilience.   8. an aid as claimed in claim 7, in which the probe means comprises an outer plastics tube (37) surrounding a fibre glass rod (38) extending along the tube.   9. an aid as claimed in any preceding claim, including means (7, 43, 45) for moving the probe means between an operative position in which it extends transversely of the elongate member and an inoperative position in which it extends generally rearwards.   10. an aid as claimed in claim 9, in which said means for moving comprises a linkage mechanism (7) connecting the probe means to an operating element (45) movable between probe-operative and probe-inoperative positions.   11. an aid as claimed in claim 10, in which the linkage mechanism is connected to the operating element (45) by a rod (43) extending along the elongate member   (10).      12. an aid as claimed in claim 10 or claim 11, including releasable detent means (48, 49) for holding the operating element (45) in said positions.   13. an aid as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising a part (18) adjacent the roller means downwardly inclined   emi14.1       with respect to the elongate member to facilitate descent of a step by a user.    14. an aid as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the roller means comprises two laterally spaced rollers   (22).      15. an aid as claimed in any preceding claim,   including    a directional hand grip (13) for the elongate member (10).   16. an aid as claimed in any preceding claim, in which   the probe means comprises ultrasonic means (65) adapted    to operate a tactile indicator   (8).      17. an aid as claimed in any preceding claim, including means (69) responsive to rotation of the roller means arranged to operate a tactile part   (71)    for providing a tactile indication of distance- travelled.   18. a method of   walking    comprising using an aid as claimed in any preceding claim with the elongate member extending forwards.
