<ABSTRACT>
an endless power transmission belt has a plurality of  grooves (16) formed in its inner surface and extending per­ pendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the belt, a cog (17)  being formed between each pair of adjacent grooves (16).   at least two of the three parameters of groove pitch (p) in  the longitudinal direction of the belt, groove depth (d) and  cut angle (a) between the facing side walls of the groove  are varied randomly between successive grooves in the  longitudinal direction of the belt.  typically, the pitch be­ tween each pair of adjacent grooves is between 60% and  100% of the thickness of the belt, the depth of each groove  is between 20% and 40% of the thickness of the belt, and  the cut angle of each groove is between 10° and 40°.
