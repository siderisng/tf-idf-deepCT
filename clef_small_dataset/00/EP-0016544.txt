<ABSTRACT>
production of a compression or sinter-mouldable powder  composition of polyethersulphone homopolymer having  repeat unit -ph-o-ph-soâ‚‚- (-ph- is p-phenylene) and a powder  filler by (a) preparing a viscous but stirrable dispersion of the  filler in dichloromethane which dispersion contains said  polyethersulphone, (b) stirring the dispersion to produce a  soft solid which breaks down into a powder, and (c) removing  residual dichloromethane.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of making powder compositions of aromatic polyethersulphone and filler, compositions made by the method, and articles made from the compositions the present invention relates to a method of making a compression-or sinter-mouldable powder composition comprising an aromatic polyethersulphone of certain repeat unit and a powdery filler, to a powder composition made using such a method, and to articles made from the composition. aromatic polyethersulphones containing the repeat unit of formula emi1.1 by which are meant in this specification homopolymers only are well known to be exceptionally useful engineering thermoplastics materials since they possess first rate toughness and tensile properties, which properties are retained at elevated temperature for prolonged lengths of time. thus such therinoplastics are capable of continuous use under load at elevated temperatures. further, they exhibit excellent fire-resistance, chemical resistance, and electrical insulant properties. as such these thermoplastic aromatic polyethersulphones are eminently suitable as binding materials for forming a matrix containing various powdery fillers so as to provide useful articles whose utility depends to a lesser or greater degree on the properties of the filler material. a filler material may also be advantageously incorporated into a matrix of the polyethersulphone simply to lower the cost of the resulting article, or to reinforce its strength, or to produce some other desirable property e.g. lower density, increased conductivity. the usual method of producing filled articles from blends of these polyethersulphones with fillers is to employ an extrusion or injection moulding process. however, with very high levels of filler, such techniques are not viable (the maximum level normally depending on the type of filler being used) and it is necessary to employ compression moulding and sinter moulding techniques. we have now discovered a method of producing a powdery composition of the above-defined aromatic polyethersulphone with a filler in which the level of filler can be very high and wherein such a composition is very suitable for processing into moulded articles using compression moulding or sinter-moulding techniques. the method is also capable of producing compositions having lower levels of filler in which case they can also be used in extrusion or injection moulding techniques for producing moulded articles. according to the present invention there is provided a method of producing a compression-or sinter-mouldable powder composition comprising an aromatic polyethersulphone as hereinbefore defined and a powdery filler1 which method comprises (a) preparing a viscous but stirrable dispersion of the filler in dichloromethane which dispersion contains said polyethersulphone, (b) stirring the dispersion to produce a soft solid which breaks down into a powder, and (c) removing residual dichloromethane from the powder produced in step (b). there is also provided according to the invention a compression-or sinter-mouldable powder composition when made by the method hereinbefore defined. there is further provided according to the invention an article produced, particularly by compression or sinter moulding, from a composition made by the method hereinbefore defined. in step (a) of the method of the invention a viscous but stirrable dispersion, i.e. of a paste-like consistency, is formed. the dispersion
