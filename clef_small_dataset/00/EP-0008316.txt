<ABSTRACT>
the reel is constructed with a pair of end frames (12), each  of which is provided with elongated apertures (28) in the end  boards (16).  the apertures (28) permit viewing of the contents  of the reel (10) when the reel is mounted in a horizontal  storage position.  the apertures (28) also provide a manual  means for grasping of the reel (10) in order to remove the reel  from a shipping carton (36).  the hook-containing strips (15) of  each end frame (12) terminate short of the corners of the  cardboard (16) to mount the reel contents in a slightly susÂ­ pended condition in a shipping carton (36).
