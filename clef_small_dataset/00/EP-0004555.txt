<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a non-crosslinked polymer-sensitive resin which comprises: (a) polymerized units of alkyl methacrylate in which the alkyl group contains from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and b) polymerized units of A salt of methacrylic acid and a metal, the latter being selected from the group consisting of barium, calcium, strontium, and lead, the amount of type A units) is between 50% and 99, 99% mole and the amount of type B units) is between 50% and 0.01% mole from the total number of mole, while the metal constitutes 0.001% to 10% by weight of the polymer. The preferred metal is lead. This resin finds application in the lithographic steps of the manufacture of the semiconductor integrated circuits, because in particular a solubility ratio S / NO (between the exposed and not exposed parts) higher than the conventional polymethacrylate type resins of Methyl (PMMA), for a given exposure.
