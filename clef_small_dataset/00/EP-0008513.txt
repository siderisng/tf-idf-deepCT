<ABSTRACT>
a switch arrangement for making and breaking a three-Â­ phase electrical supply comprises an enclosure (1a, 2)  wherein are situated three spaced fixed input terminals (11,  12, 13) and output terminals (23, 24, 25) one for each phase.  an  elongated switch device (28) extends through the enclosure  (1a, 2) and is mounted for rotation therein.  the device (28) has  a housing (31) with three spaced switching input (36, 37, 38)  and output terminals (40, 41, 42) switching means (55, 56, 57)  are axially movable within the housing (31) to make or to  break simultaneously electrical connections between the  input and output contacts of each phase.  the switch device  (28) is rotatable between a first angular position wherein the  fixed (11, 12, 13) and switching input terminals (36, 37, 38) and  also the fixed (23, 24, 25) and switching output terminals (40,  41, 42) are in electrical contact and a second angular position,  wherein the fixed (11, 12, 13) and switching input terminals  (36, 37, 38) or the fixed (23, 24, 25) and switching output  terminals (40, 41, 42) or both are out of electrical contact.  the  second position may be an isolated or earth position.  an  interlocking device (81, 86) prevents rotation of the switch  device (28) unless the switching means (55, 56, 57) are in a  position where the connections between the input and output  are broken.
