<ABSTRACT>
a winding arrangement suitable for sheeting in a sail of  a yacht comprises a winch drum (2), a handle (6) for rotating  the winch drum, coupling means (30) operable in a first  mode to connect a hydraulic pump/motor (15) to the handle  to act as a pump driven by the handle, and operable in a  second mode to connect the hydraulic pump/motor to the  winch drum to act as a motor driving the drum, and control  means (40, 41, 61) for changing the coupling means from the  first mode to the second mode and vice versa.  it is therefore  possible, by operating this winding arrangement in the first  mode, to rotate the winch drum manually so as to wind in a  sail sheet or line attached to the winch drum, and at the same  time to drive the pump to charge up a hydraulic accumulator  (28) or pass hydraulic fluid to another similar winding  arrangement operating in the second mode either directly or  through a hydraulic intensifier (33).  when the coupling  means is operable in the second mode one or more similar  winding arrangements may supply hydraulic fluid to the  pump/motor either directly or through the hydraulic intensifier  (33).
