<ABSTRACT>
a device for remote control of a hydraulic crane which  includes a hydraulic pump, a plurality of fluid actuators for  hoisting a boom tilting cylinder, a boom telescopic cylin­ der, a hoisting motor and a turning motor or the like con­ nected in parallel via oil passages to hydraulic oil supply  and exhaust circuits connected to a hydraulic oil tank,  operation selecting solenoid valves connected to the oil  passage, a proportional solenoid relief valve provided in  the oil passage for bypassing the exhaust side of the pump  to the tank for controlling the exhaust side hydraulic oil  from the hydraulic pump in a crane body and automotive  body side, respectively, operation selecting switches for  the respective operation selecting solenoids and a poten­ tiometer for controlling the proportional solenoid relief  valve in an operation terminal unit, wherein the solenoids  of the solenoid valves are electrically connected via cables  to the switches and potentiometer.  in order to control the  crane hoisting speed, the conventional relief valve hereto­ fore provided at the exhaust side of the hydraulic pump  as a hydraulic oil source is constructed of the proportional  solenoid relief valve instead of the conventional flow con­ trol valve to thereby control the hydraulic oil and accord­ ingly the operating oil pressure at the exhaust side of the  pump.  this controls the operating speed of the fluid actua­ tor for hoisting to thereby enable an economical and  smooth hoisting operation as well as its remote speed  control.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field this invention relates to a wired-type remote-control device for a hydraulic crane. background art generally speaking, when selection of crane operations of a mobile hydraulic crane is remotely controlled, e.g., to effect such operations as luffing, extension and retraction of the boom, lifting and lowering of a load, and swivel motion of the boom, it is necessary to remotely control the velocity of the crane motion, because if the velocity control function is not provided, there is a risk of crane upset caused by sway of the load, thereby crane upset is very dangerous. accordingly, a remote-control device without velocity control function can be applied only to light load operations, such as operations with small working radii or operations with lightweight loads. two methods have been proposed heretofore for controlling the velocity of crane motion: namely, a method by controlling the accelerator of an automobile engine by an electric motor, which engine drives a hydraulic pump for supplying hydraulic oil to hydraulic actuators, such as a derrick cylinder, a boom telescoping cylinder, a winch motor, and a swiveling motor; and another method by controlling the flow rate of hydraulic oil with a flow control valve disposed in a hydraulic control circuit for controlling the aforesaid hydraulic actuators. however, the first method has a shortcoming in that the response in velocity control is slow and that it is difficult to stop a suspended load exactly at a desired location. the second method has an advantage in that its operation is smooth and its response time is free from delay, but the second method has shortcomings in that a proportional electromagnetic flow control valve to be used for controlling the flow rate has a complicated construction and costly and that the oil pressure rises even during low-speed running to the set pressure of a relief valve normally provided in the hydraulic control circuit, e.g., to 145 kg/cm2, so that a high load is continuously applied to a hydraulic pump under normal operation, resulting in an increased temperature of the hydraulic oil and an increased noise from the engine and the hydraulic circuit. disclosure of invention an object of the present invention is to provide a remote-control device for a hydraulic crane with an excellent velocity control function and free from the aforesaid shortcomings. the present inventor has confirmed from both theoretical and empirical aspects the fact that velocity control through pressure control provides a better velocity control system than other conventional systems, in contrast to a general common sense in the past among specialists of hydraulic technique that a pressure control system for regulating the velocity of crane motion is undesirable because it may cause instability in control. the present invention was accomplished based on the confirmation of such fact, and the present invention makes it possible to effect smooth velocity control at a low cost by using a proportional electromagnetic relief valve in controlling the velocity of crane motion. to fulfil the aforesaid object, a remote-control device of hydraulic
