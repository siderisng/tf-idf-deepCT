<ABSTRACT>
Wallsturz for supporting one or more wall layers when bridging wall openings and the like. The fall is made of a thin sheet metal profile with Miminde stens a thigh forming the web of the fall and absorbs the occurring loads. In many cases, the bridge of the fall is hindering in the way of work below. The aim of the invention is a masonry to provide the sufficient carrying capacity during the wall work and after the masonry has received carrying capacity no longer hindring. This object was achieved in that the web of the leg (5; 12,13; 19,20) each having a series of slots extending in the longitudinal direction, for example, a series of slots (6) perforia and / or one or more cracks, rilings and the like. or combinations thereof, wherein the material weakening is designed so that the load capability in the plane of the leg is reduced only insignificant, while the material weakening simultaneously forms a bru chanum in bending of the leg along it.
