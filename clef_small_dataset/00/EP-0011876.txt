<DESCRIPTION>
automatic packaging machine and method this invention relates to an automatic machine and method for packaging parcels or stacked objects in a wrapper. nown are machines for wrapping individual objects or piled ob√•aects the machine described in the italian patent application nos 23.073 v78 provides a common rotating platform and lapping tape or web supply means for wrapping an object being rotated on the platforms to complete the package, over the objects top and base portions there is laidf either manually or through suitable means, a packaging material sheets with its edges folded onto the sides of the object, in separate steps thereafter the sides of the object are wrapped taking care to cover and secure by the end turns of the tape, the sheets laid onto the top and base. the above mentioned italian patent application has been published prior to the filing date of this application but after the claimed priority date of this application. no machine or system, either of the automatic or semiautomatic types, is known which affords the possibility of mechanically performing all of the packaging operations, without involving manual packaging steps, and without requiring the article being packaged to be transferred to several stations. this being the status of the packaging art, the task of this invention is to remove the above shortcomings in the packaging industry by providing an automatic packaging machine and packaging method, which produce a package of the type specified above through the sole utilization of the instant machine and with- out involving any further operations at other package processing stations. a particular task of this invention is therefore to provide a packaging machine of the described type including additional operative units adapted to automa- tically lay a top or bottom packaging foil onto the parcel sequentially with the sapping of the sides of the parcel. according to one aspect of this invention there is provided an automatic packaging machine which comprises a packaging foil web first supply means for wrapping the sides of the object to be packaged, a power driven turning table adapted for receiving the object to be packaged thereon, means releasably holding the object to be packaged in position on the turning table, and a load-bearing columnar frame, characterized in that it further comprises a slide arranged for sliding vertically along said columnar frame, said slide being provided with substantially horizontal rails, extending substantially parallel to said table a power driven carriage movable along said rails, a cantilevered frame carried by said carriage and whereon a packaging foil web second supply means is provided which is operative to lsy a top or bottom horizontal sheet onto the object to be packaged in a sequentially coordinated manner with the packaging foil web first supply means. the features, mode of operation and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of a presently preferred embodiment thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where: figure 1 is a perspective view of the packaging machine
