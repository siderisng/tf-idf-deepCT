<ABSTRACT>
the internal combustion engine with rotary pistons of the internal axis type consists of two groups of pistons (4, 5), rotating in the circular-cylindrical jacket (1) of an engine housing (1, 2, 3) and connected to one another by an epicyclic geartrain (6, 7), of which the pistons (4) of one group are connected to the side pieces (41) bounding the combustion chambers at the ends, and rotate evenly, and the pistons (5) of the other group rotate unevenly, the geartrain having an inner gearwheel (6) fixed to the housing, planet gearwheels (7) engaging therein, crankshafts (8) connected rigidly to the planet gearwheels and supported in parts that are rigidly connected to the large pistons (4), and having connecting rods (9) supported at the hub (51) of the small pistons (5).  the object of the invention is to avoid the end-face arrangement of a special geartrain cage in order to achieve a more compact design f1 and to facilitate the assembly of the individual rotating parts, including the geartrain, outside the motor housing.  for this purpose, the epicyclic geartrain (6, 7) is arranged on the one side and the crank geartrain is arranged on the other side of the pistons (4, 5) and the crankshafts (8) are supported in the large pistons (4) or their side pieces (41).  <image>
