<ABSTRACT>
1.  a motor vehicle windscreen wiper of the type including a wiper blade (1) generally of rubber, together with at least one pair of intermediate yokes (4) serving to couple the blade (1) and to distribute the pressure forces thereof on the windscreen, and a main arm (3) on which the intermediate yokes (4) are pivoted, each of which yokes includes a coupling and pivoting device (6) obtained integrally therewith by moulding from plastics material and constituted by two cylindrical projections (7) each disposed on a flexible part which constitutes at least one side of a housing (9) formed in the central part of the yoke (4) and in which is forcibly engaged, during assembly, a locking component of dimensions slightly greater than the housing so as to push the flexible parts and thereby the projections (7) outwardly into corresponding holes 14 formed in the two pivot flanks (3b) constituting one end of the main arm (3), characterised in that the locking component is constituted by at least one pin (12) of which the introduction separates and maintains in locking position the two cylindrical projections (7) disposed at the free ends of two flexible tongues (8) which are initially curved inwardly one towards the other.
