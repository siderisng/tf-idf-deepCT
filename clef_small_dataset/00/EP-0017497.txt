<ABSTRACT>
a horticultural enclosure that comprises a translucent  flexible cover (10) of plastics to which narrow strips (12) of  the same material are welded at intervals to form rows of  pockets (14).  the cover is fitted on a frame, the interconnectÂ­ ing members (20) of which are received in the pockets, the  tension in the cover being such as to hold the frame together  without any additional fastening means.  the cover can  readily be made by a continuous method.
