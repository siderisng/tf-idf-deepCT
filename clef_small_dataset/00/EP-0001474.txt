<ABSTRACT>
a wheel probe for use on a pipeline inspection vehicle  for the purpose of ultrasonically inspecting the wall of the  pipe, the wheel probe comprising a solid annular rim (22)  made of a non-deformable material through which sound  will pass, and side members (24) which together with the  rim (22) define a hollow chamber, an ultrasonic transducer  or transducers (31) located within the chamber and positioned  adjacent the inside surface of the rim (22) for directing  and receiving sound through the rim (22), and the  space between the transducers (31) and the rim (22) being  filled with an acoustic coupling liquid, and a solid resilient  tyre member (32) mounted on the outside surface of the  rim (22).
