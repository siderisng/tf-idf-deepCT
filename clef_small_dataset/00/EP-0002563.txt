<ABSTRACT>
an applicance (10) is provided which is capable of  transmitting heat retained therein to cooked food placed in  the applicance (10), so that the food can be kept hot when an  electrical cord (37) used for initially causing the applicance  (10) to be electrically heated is disconnected therefrom.  the  appliance (10) includes an outer casing (11) and a removable  cover (12), both of which are made of materials that retard  heat loss from the appliance (10), preferably non-metallic  materials.  it further includes a housing (13) enclosed by the  casing (11) and cover (12) and made of a non-metallic  material, such as plastic, in which a non-metallic heat  retaining material (30), such as wax, is confined.  disposed  throughout the heat retaining material (30) is a resistance  heater (31), which is removably connected to the electrical  cord (37) for melting the material (30), so that the heat of  fusion of the melted material may be transmitted into the  food to reduce its cooling rate after the heater (31) is  disconnected from the cord (37).
