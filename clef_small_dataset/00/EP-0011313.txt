<ABSTRACT>
a digital multiplex type vehicle electrical switching sys­ tem includes a transmitter and a plurality of receivers, each  controlling a group of load devices (l₁. . . . l₄).  the transmitter  produces a sequence of multibit digital words on a data bus  (10), each word including a plurality of address bits followed  by a number of utilization code bits identifying the required  state of the load devices associated with the receiver having  an address code corresponding the address bits in the word.   each receiver includes an input register (50) and, at the start of  each word, all the receiver input registers receive the address  code.  each receiver also includes address code recognition  means (56) which responds only to one address code.  only  that receiver in which the address code is recognised, accepts  the utilization code into its input register, the address code  recognition means of all the other receivers operating to block  the input registers thereof.
