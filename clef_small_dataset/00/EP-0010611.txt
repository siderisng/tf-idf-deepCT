<ABSTRACT>
an identity card which is suitable for automatic identification of persons and which is forgery-proof to a high extent.  for this purpose, the invention provides that the identification card is inseparably connected to a hologram in which characteristic physiological or physiology-related features of a person are recorded.  advantageously, a speech sample and/or body measurements and/or a sample of handwriting and/or a fingerprint of the person are stored in the hologram.  the card is highly forgery-proof and it can be used with a high reliability for identifying persons.
