<ABSTRACT>
lithographic printing plates are prepared by:   1) providing a sensitized lithographic substrate (10) having a  photochemical coating (12) thereon that has its solub√Ølity  altered upon exposure to actinic radiation (for example an  anodized aluminium substrate (10) coated with a uv sensitive  diazo resin);   2) depositing on selected portions of the sensitized substrate  a layer of non-silver halide material (14) that is opaque  to the actinic radiation that will alter the solutility  characteristics of the photochemical coating (this forms a  so-called fugitive negative on the sensitized substrate and  electrostatic or laser transfer techniques can be used for  forming the fugitive negative);   3) exposing the sensitized substrate to actinic radiation to  alter the solubility characteristics of the uncovered portions  of the photochemical coating; and   4) dissolving away the soluble portions of the photochemical  coating.  if desired the non-silver halide fugitive negative  can be removed after exposing the sensitized substrate.
