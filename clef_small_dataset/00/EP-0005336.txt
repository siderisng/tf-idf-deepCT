<ABSTRACT>
a transfer device which carries out a cyclic path of  movement along vertical (a, c) and horizontal (b, d)  paths in order to transfer an article 3 to be treated to and  from a working station e. g.  a washing station (4, 5) of an  installation.  the transfer device comprises fixed bars (1) on  which the article can be supported, and movable conveyor  bars (2) which transfer the article (3) from the fixed bars  (1) to the working station (4, 5) and, after treatment, return  the treated article to the fixed bars (1).  in order to avoid contact occuring between the article  (3) and equipment provided at the working station, during  the upper most one (b) of the two horizontal paths of  movement of the conveyor bars (2), either the vertically  downward or the vertically upward movement of the conveyor  bars (2) is split into two paths (c′, c″ or a′, a″)  respectively which are separated by said upper one horizontal  path of movement (b).

<DESCRIPTION>
"transfer device for use in a washing installation" this invention relates to a transfer device which has been designed primarily, though not exclusively, for use in a washing installation for washing machined parts, the device comprising relatively fixed bars on which a part to be washed can be placed and relatively movable conveyor bars which are movable to transfer a part from the fixed bars to a washing apparatus and then to return the washed part to the fixed bars. it is known to provide a transfer device of the above type in which the movable bars carry out a series of four consecutive movements in order to transfer a machined part from the fixed bars to the washing apparatus, and then to return the washed part.to the fixed bars, the series of movements comprising a vertically upward displacement, a forward horizontal displacement, a vertically downward displacement and a. backward horizontal displacement. the transfer device according to the invention is particularly suitable for use in a washing installation for washing axially extending machined parts of circular cross-section which have internal transversely extending lubricating ducts, such as the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine or a camshaft. however, it should be understood that the transfer device according to the invention is suitable for use in washing other types of machined parts, or indeed many other types of article which require to be washed. hitherto, a main difficulty in washing the internal ducts of machined parts satisfactorily is created by virtue of the fact that the ducts are usually long and narrow and have many branches, so that it is difficult to apply sufficient pressure and rate of flow of cleaning medium throughout the system of ducts. conventionally, it is attempted to overcome this problem by providing monitoring devices which control the flow of cleaning medium, such as water, in different directions in accordance with.pre-set programmes, this control involving the selective admission of cleaning medium through some holes and the closure of other of the holes to the duct system. in practice, it is particularly difficult to provide the pre-set washing programme in high performance washing installations combined with a satisfactory transfer device for transfering the parts to and from the washing installation. in a known installation, it has been proposed to lower the washing apparatus under the control of separate drive parts of the transfer device. the washing apparatus is lowered until injectors of the cleaning medium touch the surface of the part to be washed. however, a separate washing apparatus, which may take the form of a washing box, has to be arranged at each washing station of the installation. as each washing box has its own independent movement, a considerable number of pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders are employed in order to move the washing boxes, so that tbere is the disadvantage of a very complicated mechanical construction. forced washing of the part is achieved by pressing-down of the washing boxes on the part. it is also known to provide
