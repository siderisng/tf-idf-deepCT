<ABSTRACT>
a releasable retaining means for mounting on the inside  of an outward opening closure element movable to open and  close an opening.  first and second mounting means (13 and  14) are respectively mountable on the closure element (11)  and opening surround (12) with a stay (15) slidably and pivotably  coupled to the second mounting means (14).  stay (15) is  pivotably couplable by engagement means (22) to the first  mounting means (13) and releasable therefrom by sliding stay  (15) relative to mounting means (14) but only when the closure  element is closed.  recoupling means (16, 24) automatically  cause the engagement means (22) to couple to said first  mounting means (13) when the closure (11) is moved into the  closed position.  the retaining means thus prevents closure element (11)  from opening more than a predetermined amount unless the  stay (15) is released from the first mounting means (13) prior  to opening the closure element (11).  if stay (15) is released it  becomes automatically recoupled on closing the closure element.
