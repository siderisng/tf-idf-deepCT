<ABSTRACT>
device for locating a heavy component such as an electrical  battery on a chassis such as that of an industrial lift  truck, and for preventing dislodgement of the battery even  during excessive tilting of the chassis.  the apparatus includes a frame formed from two spaced  parallel channel members which extend longitudinally of the  truck and are bolted to the chassis (10).  in the upper surface  of each channel member is a downwardly extending slot (19)  in which a respective spigot (18) of the battery (16) is  received when the battery (16) is located between the two  channel members.  a respective flap (21) pivotally attached to  each channel member adjacent its slot (19) is then rotated  about its pivot into an operative position in which it covers a  substantial portion of the slot (19) the end of spigot (18)  being accommodated in an aperture (30) in the flap (21).  to  retain the flap (21) in its operative position, a second flap or  latch (25) pivotally mounted on flap (21) is rotated about its  pivot until wings on flap (25) engage an inclined surface (15)  of the respective channel member.  thus the flap (21) cannot  be released from its operative position until the wings of the  flap (25) are disengaged from surfaces (15).  as long as the flaps (21) are held in their operative positions  by the respective flaps (25), the engagement of the  spigots (18) in slots (19) and apertures (30) prevents dislodgement  of the battery (16) even during excessive tilting of  the chassis (10).
