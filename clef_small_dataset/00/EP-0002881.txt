<ABSTRACT>
5-isoxazalyl ureas of formula    and salts thereof, wherein   r¹ represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a nitro,  amino, substituted amino, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl,  aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, or substituted aralkyl,  group, or a group of formula -xr⁶ or -coor¹⁵ in which x  represents oxygen, sulphur, sulphinyl or sulphonyl, r⁶ represents  alkyl or aryl, and r¹⁵ represents a hydrogen atom  or an alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, or cycloalkyl,  group;   r² represents cyano, nitro, carboxy, carboxy ester,  carboxyamide, carboxyamide whose amide group is substituted,  or a group of formula    in which    represents  a 5-7 ring membered heterocyclic radical which optionally  may be substituted;   r³ represents hydrogen, alkyl or a group of formula    --r⁷ in which r⁷ represents alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or alkylthio;   r⁴ represents hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl;   r⁵ represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryl  or substituted aryl; or   r³ and r⁵ together represent alkylene, optionally unsaturated,  optionally interrupted by one or more atoms  selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur atoms, and  optionally substituted, are new compounds, which are  pesticides or plant growth regulants, particularly selective  herbicides.
