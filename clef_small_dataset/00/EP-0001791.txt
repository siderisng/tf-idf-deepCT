<ABSTRACT>
a thermoplastic synthetic resin such as polyethylene or  ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resin containing 0. 1 to 10  wt.  % of a specific additive selected from specific classes of  compounds, namely saturated higher fatty acid amides,  saturated higher aliphatic amines and complete esters of  saturated higher fatty acids is found to be very suitable for  production of expanded articles and can be easily formed  into expanded articles with little shrinkage after expansion,  free from creases on the surface or cracks on the cell walls,  and having excellent characteristics such as good closed cellular  characteristic, high compressive strength, low density,  etc.
