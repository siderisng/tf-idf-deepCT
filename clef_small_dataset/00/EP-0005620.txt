<ABSTRACT>
novel bridged vinca dimers are described, of the  following formula;   r-nh-ch₂-(ch₂)n-x-(ch₂)n-ch₂-nh-r   wherein each r is the same or different residue of an  indole-dihydroindole alkaloid of the general formula:    wherein   r¹ is oh or o-co-ch₃;   r² is ch₃, h or cho:   when taken singly, one of r³ and r⁴ is h or oh, and the  other is c₂h₅, and r⁵ is h; and when r⁴ and r⁵ are taken  together, they form an α-epoxide ring and r³ is c₂h₅;   x is s, o, se-se, nh, n-[(ch₂)m -ch₂-nh-r] or (ch₂)p  wherein p and each n are 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; and m is 1 or 2; and   pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts thereof.  the compounds are useful pharmaceuticals especially  as oncolytic agents.  they are prepared by reacting the  corresponding azide of an indole-dihydronidole alkaloid with  an appropriate diamine or triamine.  some of the intermediates  employed in this preparation are novel, namely those  having the structure:   r⁶-nh-ch₂-(ch₂)n-q′-(ch₂)n-ch₂-nh₂ where r⁶ is the  group r defined above in which r¹ is oh and r² is ch₃ or h,  and q′ is s, s-s, q, se-se, or (ch₂)p where n and p is 0, 1, 2, 3  or 4.
