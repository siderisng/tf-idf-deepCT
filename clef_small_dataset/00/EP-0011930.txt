<ABSTRACT>
a polymer blend consists of (a) 90. 0-98. 0 wt. % of polyethylene or copolymers of ethylene with 1. 0-9. 0 wt. % vinyl acetate having a melt index of 0. 3-7. 0g/10 mins.  and a density of 917-933 kg/m3 and (b) 10. 0-2. 0 wt. % of polybutene of m. wt.  1000-2000, esp.  1300 or 700-1000, esp.  900.  films of the blend are also claimed.  the films have excellent cling and tack props.  making them suitable for use in self-sealing stretch wrapping and self sealing packaging and providing interlayer adhesion between layers of film.

<DESCRIPTION>
blends of polyethylene and polybutene and films made from the blends this invention relates to blends of either low density polyethylene or ethylene vinyl acetate (eva) copolymers with certain polymers of butene and to films from such blends that are suitable for use as self-sealing stretch wrapping film and self-sealing packaging film. one technique for utilizing packages such as pallet loads is known as rotary stretch wrapping. this technique uses film which is wound under tension around the package by either rotating the package on a turntable or by winding the film around a stationary package. the films used for this technique are made from a variety of polymers including low density ethylene homopolymer (ldpe), ethylene vinyl acetate (eva) copolymers containing from 2% to 12% by weight vinyl acetate and plastized polyvinyl chloride (pvc). the preferred characteristic of film used in rotary stretch wrapping is the ability to cling to itself sufficiently thereby self-sealing the wrap without the use of an adhesive or a heat sealing operation. other important characteristics of film used in rotary stretch wrapping are toughness, stretchability and stress retention. self-sealing packaging films are used for wrapping display foods such as fresh meat cuts, bakery products and produce in supermarkets and for wrapping of various foods in the home such as sandwiches and salads. self-sealing packaging films are made from a variety of resins including ldpe, eva copolymers containing from 2% to 12% by weight vinyl acetate and plasticized pvc. the most important characteristic of self-sealing packaging films is its ability to cling to itself sufficiently to provide a wrap which does not require the use of an adhesive or heat sealing operation. it is an object of this invention to provide blended polymeric olefinic materials of superior properties. another object is to provide suon blended materials which may be easily compounded in that they are comprised of a basic po@ymeric olefinic resin and g single modifier. the blends of this inventios insist essentially of a) from 90.0 to 98.0 per cent t weight of a polymer selected frcm polye@hyle@e and copolymers of ethylene with from 1,0 to 90 per cent by weigbt of vinyl acetate, having a melt index (m@) in the range cf 0.3 to 7.0 grams per 1c minutes anc a density in the range of 917 to 933 kg/m3, and bj from 10.0 to 2.0 per cent by weight of polybutene having a molecular weight of 700 to 2000. a blend consisting entirely of the two components (a) and (b) as specified above provides excellent mechanical and cling properties. however additives may be incorported if desired, e.g. antioxidants, uv stabilisers, des cr pigments and antistatic additives. the antioxidants an. uv stabilisers can prolong the life of films even though they do not improve its mechanical properties. dyes and pigments can be used when coloured film is needea. if film becomes charged it may attract dust and this can be reduced by incorporating antistatic additives . it is emphasised that these additives affect only
