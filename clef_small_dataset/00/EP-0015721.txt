<DESCRIPTION>
composition for rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions and method for its preparation this invention relates to pharmaceutical (including veterinary) compositions for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions. according to the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a solid mixture comprising quinine sulphate and ascorbic acid. as used herein, the term quinine sulphate" is intended to mean any compound including the quinine and sulphate species, and preferably quinine bisuinhate. quinine sulphate may preferably constitute between 3.5 percent and 18 percent inclusive hy weight of the composition. the composition is preferably constituted in unit dosage form, for example in tablet form, in which the amount of quinine sulphate per unit dose is not greater than 35 milligrams. rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic complaints may be caused by crystalline material, which is formed in the human body, and which can concentrate at points in the body whereby it applies pressure to nerves causing acute pain or even a form of paralysis. it is believed that the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention serves to relax the muscles of the patient, hence reducing the pressure caused by the existence of the crystalline formation, and simultaneously destroys the crystalline formation. tablets according to the invention may be produced by conventional tabletting techniques, and may include conventional additives, such as inert fillers and diluents, binders and flavourings. individual tablets may preferably weiqh from 100 milligrams to 1 gram, of which from 18 to 35 milligrams may preferably be constituted by quinine sulphate. the amount of ascorbic acid is not particularly critical provided that sufficient is present, as the body will excrete any excess, but it is generally preferred that the amount of the ascorbic acid is from 4 to 25 times that of quinine sulphate by weight. in a particularly preferred embodiment, no filler is used, and ascorbic acid constitutes the balance of a tablet of which from 3.5 to 18% is quinine sulphate. the composition according to the invention may be administered to mammalian animals, particularly humans and dogs, in the treatment of arthritic conditions, for example rheumatoid arthritis. example quinine sulphate and ascorbic acid were ground together in a mortar and pestle in the ratio 35 to 155 by weight, and the resulting dry mixture was formulated into 200 milligram tablets, of which 35 milligrams was constituted by quinine, the balance being ascorbic acid. the tablets were found to be highly efficacious in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in human beings. they were also found to be useful in the treatment of arthritis, sometimes wrongly diagnosed as "slipped disc" in dogs.

<CLAIMS>
claims    1. a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a solid mixture comprising quinine sulphate and ascorbic acid.     2. a pharmaceutical   comoosition    as claimed in claim 1 wherein the quinine sulphate constitutes   rom    3.5 to 18   by    weight of the composition.    3. a composition as claimed in claim 2 in unit dosage form the amount of quinine sulphate in each dose forms not greater than 35 milligrams.    4. a composition as claimed in claim 3, in tablet form.    5. a pharmaceutical tablet including a pharmaceutically effective amount not exceeding 3.5   m.q.    of quinine sulphate, the balance being essentially ascorbic acid.    6. a method of making a pharmaceutical composition, which method comprises mixing quinine sulphate and ascorbic acid to produce a composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 4.
