<ABSTRACT>
a workpiece supporting and clamping arrangement  includes supporting structure (1) defining a supporting surface  (6, 7).  a first top member (8) having an upper surface  (12) is supported by the supporting structure (1) on the supporting  surface (6, 7).  a second top member (9) likewise has  an upper surface (15) and both upper surfaces (12, 15) lie in a  substantially horizontal plane.  the top members (8, 9) also  have respective mutually adjacent side walls defining clamping  surfaces.  a guiding structure (18) is provided for guiding  the second top member (9) relative to the supporting structure  (1).  the second top member (9) can be moved along the  guiding structure (18) so as to adjust the position of the second  top member (9) with respect to the first top member (8).   the guiding structure (18) is pivotally mounted so that the  second top member can be rotated from a first position on  the supporting surface (6, 7) whereat the upper surfaces (12,  15) of the top members (8, 9) are in the same horizontal plane  to a second position whereat the second top member (9) is in  a plane transverse to said horizontal plane so as to cause the  clamping surfaces (10, 11) and the supporting surface (6, 7) to  conjointly define a three point clamping system.  in the first  position, the clamping arrangement is suited for clamping  workpieces having two surfaces that are substantially parallel  to each other; whereas, in the second position, the clamping  arrangement is especially suited to clamping workpieces  having a cylindrical or polygonal shape such as, for example,  a section of tubular conduit.
