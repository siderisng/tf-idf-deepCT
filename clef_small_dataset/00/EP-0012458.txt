<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus comprising a housing - in which at least  one compartment is formed - that can be connected to the  suction side of a pump, which compartment is open on the  underside and accommodates a rotor which is equipped  with a member of downwardly projecting knives (10) which  have different angular positions and which are arranged in  groups that are approximately equidistant from the rotary  shaft (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
an apparatus for disintegrating and removing earth, in particular under water the invention relates to an apparatus for disintegrating and removing earth, in particular under water, comprising a housing, in which at least one compartment is formed, that can be connected to the suction side of a pump, which compartment is open on the underside, and accommodates a rotor which comprises disintegrating means, the rotary shaft of said rotor being supported in the housing and being coupled to a drive means which is mounted on the housing, said rotary shaft being at least substantially perpendicular to the plane through the lower edge of the compartment, while the rotor protrudes beyond this plane. it is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus of this kind which is particularly suitable for processing hard and/or cohesive layers of earth and which has a high discharging capacity. to this end, the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the rotor is equipped with a number of downwardly projecting knives which have different angular positions and which are arranged in groups that are approximately equidistant from the rotary shaft. the knives are capable of exercising a very powerful cutting action upon the earth layer to be removed, so that the earth is disintegrated and discharged. a satis factory distribution of the forces which act upon the rotor is attained as a result of the particular arrangement of the knives in the groups. as a result, this rotor, despite the great magnitude of the forces which develop, nevertheless has a long service life. furthermore, its operation is marked by the absence of vibrations. a preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the rotor is provided with a central plate member lying in a plane extending at right angles to the rotary shaft, said central plate member comprising a plurality of blades each having a concave and a convex side edge, said convex side edge being the leading edge, when viewed in the direction of rotation of the rotor. each of the blades may carry a number of said knives, while said blades connect to obliquely arranged vanes that are positioned farther outwardly, near the wall of the housing, which vanes extend inside the compartments to the vicinity of the upper wall of the housing and terminate in the outermost knives. a favourable position is thus obtained for the knives, while the blades and the vanes further the removal of the loosened earth. the housing may comprise two compartments that are arranged side by side, while the rotors that are housed in these compartments are driven in opposite directions, a suction chamber being provided between the compartments which is connected to the two compartments as well as to the suction side of the pump. this suction chamber may connect to a pipe which debouches below the water level, a valve being inserted in the pipe which is normally closed but which opens when the vacuum in the

 claims:    1. an apparatus for disintegrating and removing earth, in particular under water, comprising a housing, in which at least one compartment is formed, that can be connected to the suction side of a pump, which compartment is open on the underside, and accommodates a rotor which comprises disintegrating means, the rotary shaft of said rotor being supported in the housing and being coupled to a drive means which is mounted on the housing, said rotary shaft being at least substantially perpendicular to the plane through the lower edge of the compartment, while the rotor protrudes beyond this plane, characterized in that the rotor is equipped with a   member    of downwardly projecting knives which have different angular positions and which are arranged in groups that are approximately equidistant from the rotary shaft.    2. an apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the rotor is provided with a central plate number lying in a plane extending at right angles to the rotary shaft, said central plate member comprising a plurality of blades each having a concave and a convex side edge, said convex side edge being the leading edge, when viewed in the direction of rotation of the rotor.    3. an apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the blades each carry a number of said knives, while said blades connect to obliquely arranged vanes that are positioned farther outwardly, near the wall of the housing, which vanes extend inside the compartments  to the vicinity of the upper wall of the housing and terminate in the outermost knives.    4. an apparatus according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the housing comprises two compartments that are arranged side by side, while the rotors that are housed in these compartments are driven in opposite directions, a suction chamber being provided between the compartments which is connected to the two compartments as well as to the suction side of the pump.    5. an apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the suction chamber connects to a pipe which debouches below the water level, a valve being inserted in the pipe which is normally closed but which opens when the vacuum in the suction chamber becomes too high.    6. an apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the compartments have a substantially conical shape and increase in diameter towards the open side, a suction channel being formed in each compartment near the suction chamber, said suction channel being defined on one side by the wall of the housing and opening at one end into the relative compartment, while the opposite end of the suction channel is in open communication with the suction chamber.     7. an apparatus according to any one of claims 4 through 6, characterized in that the lower edge of the housing is bent inwardly between the compartments on at least one side.    8. an apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the ratio of the developed length of the lower edge of the housing to the amount of earth-and-water mixture to be removed by suction of the pump is selected in such a way that the rate of passage of the earth-and-water mixture is so low as to prevent any air pocket from being attracted.
