<ABSTRACT>
rotary valve controlled internal combustion engine and method for facilitating the relative motion between the elements of a sliding valve.  this apparatus has a flow duct or a channel (304) and a rotary valve device (314) connected therein.  intermittently operating sealing elements (sliding plates) (332, 334) for preventing a flow through the channel have a sealing surface which can be brought intermittently into an immovable sealing position transversely over the channel (304).  special devices (358-362) are used to displace the sealing surface as a function of the method of operation of the rotary valve device (314) into this stationary sealing position with respect to the channel (304) and out of this sealing position, in order to improve the sealing, in operation of the rotary valve device (314).  a device (394-408) for the oil-free lubrication of the sliding plates which can move with respect to one another is furthermore provided.  the invention furthermore provides for a method for facilitating the relative motion between the elements of a sliding valve.  <image>
