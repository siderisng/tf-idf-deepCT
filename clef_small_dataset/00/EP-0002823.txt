<ABSTRACT>
an rod-baffled heat exchanger (10) in which the tube  bundle (14) thereof comprises a plurality of tubes (20)  supported intermediate their ends by at least one outer  support ring (34) and a plurality of baffle rods (36, 38)  carried by the outer ring (34) and extending between parallel  tube rows.  the baffle rods (36, 38) are movable from  a first position wherein the tubes (20) adjacent thereto are  loosely supported by the rods (36, 38) to facilitate assembly,  to a second position wherein the tubes (20) are firmly  engaged and radially supported by the rods (36, 38).  various  forms of baffle rods are disclosed along with a method  of construction of the heat exchanger.
