<ABSTRACT>
pouching apparatus for increasing the volume of ma足 terial packed into a pouch.  the apparatus includes a filler  wheel assembly.  means for rotating said assembly, a vacu足 um transfer wheel mounted below said filler wheel assembly  and rotatable therewith, a plurality of vertical lands circum足 ferentially spaced around said transfer wheel to receive a  web of pouches, means for applying vacuum to said lands,  a plurality of tuck fingers movably mounted on the transfer  wheel between said lands, a stationary, circumferential cam  mounted adjacent said transfer wheel to raise said tuck  fingers to form an upward tuck in the bottom of each pouch  of said web thereby increasing its capacity.  the apparatus  also includes clips to hold the web on the lands of the trans足 fer wheel.  the apparatus also includes a feed roll which  feeds said web onto said transfer wheel at a preselected  speed somewhat greater than the speed of said transfer  wheel to force pouches into the space between said lands.   the apparatus further includes means providing one or more  jets of air to open the pouches prior to filling.
