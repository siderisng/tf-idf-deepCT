<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for dispensing viscous pastes, creams and  the like substances (12) that are not free-flowing under grav­ ity comprises a container (10) and a charge-dispensing pump  (120) at the bottom thereof.  the pump comprises a cylinder  (122) and a piston (130) consisting of an inner member (132)  and an outer member (134).  the piston (130) is reciprocated  by a piston rod (126).  in non-operated position, stem (133) of  inner piston member (132) closes and seals a dispensing  nozzle (146) at the outer end of the piston rod.  when the  piston rod is actuated downwardly, the nozzle (146) moves  away from the stem (133) until shoulders (152) on the piston  rod engage fins (148) on the stem and pull the inner piston  member (132) down until it seats on the top of outer piston  member (134) closing apertures (33) therein.  substance (12)  is then expelled by piston (130) from cylinder (22) through  outlet port (129) between the top of the piston rod and the  inner member (132), the annular passage (152) through the  piston and nozzle (146).  when after dispensing the contents  of the cylinder the piston rod is actuated upwardly nozzle  (146) moves onto stem (133) and is thereby sealed, and port  (129) closes.  the inner piston member (132) is then lifted  through outer piston member (134), opening apertures 33.  a  rib (27) on inner member (132) then entrains the outer  member (134) and the piston (130) moves back to its non-­ operated position causing a vacuum in cylinder (122) which  thus refills with substance (12) through apertures (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
dispensing viscous substances. this invention relates to apparatus for dispensing viscous pastes, creams and other substances and in particular substances of a high viscosity such that they are not free-flowing under gravity, which comprises a container for holding a quantity of substance to be dispensed, a charge dispensing pump at one end of the container, the pump comprising a cylinder, a piston reciprocable in the cylinder, a piston rod and exteriorly operable means for actuating the piston rod through a dispensing stroke and a return stroke. most pump-type dispensing apparatus for dispensing fluid substances depend for their operation on the substance being dispensed being sufficiently free-flowing under gravity so as to flow freely into and refill the pumping chamber after a delivery stroke. viscous pastes, creams and other substances which are not free-flowing under gravity cannot be dispensed by apparatus of this type wherein the flow of substance under gravity is relied on to refill the pumping chamber. the invention as claimed is characterised in that the piston rod is hollow, a delivery nozzle is arranged at the outer end of the piston rod, the piston is carried at the inner end of the piston rod and comprises a first member having a periphery spaced from the cylinder side wall and a second member contacting the cyl nder side wall and slidably mounted on the first member for relative movement axially between a first position in which the first member closes at least one aperture provided in the second member for passage therethrough of substance from the container into the cylinder and opens at least one outlet port in the piston rod, and a second position in which the said at least one aperture is open for passage of substance and the said at least one outlet port is closed, and means for closing the delivery nozzle at the conclusion of the dispensing stroke. the contact between the second piston member and the cylinder side wall is such that frictional drag and the inertia of the substance with which the second member is in contact causes a switch over from one of the first and second positions to the other on reversal of the direction of reciprocating movement of the piston rod. separate inlet and outlet valves associated with the piston are not required in this construction, the function of such valves being performed by the slidable second piston member movable between its first and second positions. the invention may be carried out by the apparatus illustrated by way of example in the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which : figure 1 is a diagrammatic longitudinal section through one form of the apparatus; figures 2 to 6 are enlarged sectional views of the lower end of the container and the primp at respectively different stages in the operating cycle; figure 7 is an enlarged perspective view of the pump piston and piston rod; figure 8 is a similar perspective view of a member incorporating a delivery nozzle; figure 9 is a
