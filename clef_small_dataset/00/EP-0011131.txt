<ABSTRACT>
1.  an installation device (1) having a screwless cover, the manually-operated element (2) of which stands on a neck portion (7) of the base (6) of the device and is supported on the base (6) of the device and an inermediate cover plate (9) so as to be capable of being pulled off on the plug-and-socket principle, characterized in that the manually-operated element (2) forms at least one receiving member (10), aligned perpendicularly to the neck portion (7) of the base (6) of the device, to receive a spring (11) which, by means of a slidable head portion (12), engages in a groove (13) formed in the axial direction on the neck portion (7) of the base of the device and upstanding at its end, and which spring, at its other end, rests against a limb (14) of an angled member (15) which is supported on the manually-operated element (2) and the free limb (16) of which rests on the cover plate (9).
