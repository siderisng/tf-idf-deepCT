<ABSTRACT>
a motor driven valve control circuit includes an electronic  switch element (19,13) biased to conduct by a resistor (20)  connected by diodes (21,22) to both poles of a switch (23).  a  relay (10) controlled by one pole of the switch determines the  direction of connection of the motor (11) in series with the  element (19,13).  a thyristor (24) connected to shunt the bias  current away from the switch element (19,13) is gated by a  voltage comparator (30) comparing the voltage across a  motor current sensing element (17) with a reference voltage,  so as to fire the thyristor when the motor current exceeds a set  limit.  the circuit eliminates the need for latching limit  switches usually employed in motor driven valve controls.
