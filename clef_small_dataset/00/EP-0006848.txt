<ABSTRACT>
a base coated substrate carries a pattern defined by a  silicone-containing printing ink (22).  a silicone-containing top  coat (24) covers the inked substrate.  the top coat being dis­ turbed by the repulsion forces of the ink's silicone at locations  adjacent the edges of the patterns (26,28) thereby producing a  three-dimensional effect in an otherwise smooth top coat  surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
decorative peel. the present invention relates to a decorative panel particularly suited for such uses as wall and ceiling coverings, furniture, etc. in fabricating such a panel, it is desirable wo produce a surface which is non-uniform so as. to provide a three-dimensional effect. attempts have been made in the past to form a panel having a textured surface by applying to a substrate a sllicone-containing ink in a pattern and covering the inked substrate with a top coating. the silicone repels the top coating at the edges of the ink-top coat interface to produce an uneven surface. such prior efforts are disclosed, for example, in united states patent 3,811,915 which issued on may 21, 1974 in the names of harry bunell and robert c. mi' len, jr., and in canadian patent 981,124 which was cranted to john c. barker and ivan p. mclaughlin on january , 1976. however, 2n ;important shortcoming exists in the previously known products. more particularly, using the techniques described in the aforesaid patents, when a given segment of ink covers a substantial area for. the purpose of producing, for example, a geometric figure on the finished panel, the application of the top coating results in the figure having a plurality of separate "islands" of top coating within the confines of the area defined by the ink or alternatively a series of nfìshex-es" or cells of the top coating within this area. the latter result can be referred te as a "hammered" effect. while such configurations have interesting and attractive appearances, it is impossible to accurately duplicate them in subsequent panels. thus, when a plurality of panels so fabricated are used to cover a wall, the randomly produced effects in the several panels produce an overall appearance which is generally unacceptable. the problem just described is recognized in canadian patent 981,124 where it is stated that for best results, the inked pattern should define lines of 1/16 to 3/16 thickness rather than surface areas. another shortcoming of products of the type disclosed in the aforesaid patents is that as the upper limit of silicone in the printing ink is reached (the upper limits being stated as 3t in u.s. patent 3,811,915 and 5% in canadian patent 981,124), the displacement of the top coat away from the edges of the printing ink increases causing a substantial buildup of top coat material in an irregular manner. this condition detracts from the appearance of the product. a still further aesthetic problem of prior art products is that when a material such as polyester is used in the top coat (as is disclosed in each of the aforesaid patents), the natural characteristic of the material is to produce an uneven surface. the present invention constitutes an improvement over the prior art by providing for a panel construction having a three-dimensional effect on its surface while also allowing large surface areas to be printed and covered with a top coating of uniform thickness. this 1: accomplished by providing respectively both the

   claims :       1. in a decorative panel comprising a   pigmented    base coated substrate, a silicone containing printing ink forming a pattern on a portion of said substrate and a top coat material covering said pattern and the remaining portion of said substrate, the improvement comprising said printing ink containing at least 5 weight percent   silicon    said top coat material containing an effective amount of silicone, and said silicone in said printing   inkand    said  silicone in said top coat material being such as to produce a depression at the printing ink-top coat interface adjacent the periphery of the pattern formed from said printing ink and an elevation immediately outwardly of the said depression so as to produce a three-dimensional effect,   with the level of the top coat material over the remainder of said pattern being substantially the same  level as the remainder of said panel wherein the remainder of said pattern and the remainder of said panel are smooth  and essentially free of separate islands of said too coat material.    2. the decorative panel of claim 1 wherein  silicone is present in said printing ink in an amount of  5-20 percent by weight thereof.    3. the decorative panel of claim 1 wherein  silicone is present in said top coat material in an amount  of 0.05-0.5 percent by weight thereof.    4. the decorative panel of claim 1 wherein  said pattern covers a substantial area of said pigmented  base coated substrate.
