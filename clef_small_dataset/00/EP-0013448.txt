<ABSTRACT>
a cold-pressing process is used for fitting a cylindrical body with a fixed collar resistant to relative rotation at high shear stresses.  the invention is specifically applied to a shell and a driving band (9), the shell being provided with a keyed portion (2) having a plurality of axially parallel keys (7) each machined at one end face (6) to provide a cutting edge (8).  in assembly the collar is aligned with the keyed portion and axially pressed against the cutting edges so as to broach keyways in the collar which engage fully with the keys.
