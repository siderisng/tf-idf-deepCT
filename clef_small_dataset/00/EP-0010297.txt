derivatives of polyene mac > -oliae antibiotics containing an amino sugar moiety, process for the preparation thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. this invention relates to derivatives of polyene macrolide antibiotics containing an amino sugar moiety, process for the preparation thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. it has been established that compounds of this invention show antifungal activity and are useful in the treatment of fungal infections. polyene macrolide antibiotics containing an amino sugar moiety are known in the art. in general they are useful in the treatment of mycosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy and elevated blood cholesterol. 2\rnona such known polyene macrolides are amphotericin b, candicidin and nystatin which are used as anti-fungal agents. the most commonly known and used agent is amphotericin b in the form of its sodium desoxycholate complex, which is sold under the registered trademark fungizone. lack of water solubility, poor stability, and toxic properties have hindered other polyene macrolides achieving an important place in therapy. attempts have been made to improve the usefulness of amphotericin b. straight chain alkyl esters of amphotericin b and a number of other polyene antibiotics have been reported. the reports indicate that these esters and their salts generally have reduced toxicity compared with the parent polyene antibiotics, but at the same time they also have reduced activity. n-acyl derivatives of these compounds have also been prepared and, again, although they have been found to be less toxic than their parent polyene antibiotics, they have also been found to be less potent. n-glycosyl derivatives of certain polyene antibiotics have also been reported and these appear to be equipotent or more potent than their parents and about as toxic. according to the prior art it was not possible so far, to produce a less toxic but potent systemic anti-fungal agent. the novel compounds of this invention are the polyene macrolide antibiotic derivatives of the general formula emi2.1 wherein m is a polyene macrolide antibiotic moiety containing an amino sugar moiety, the amino group of which is substituted by x, wherein x is emi2.2 wherein a and b independently of each other are hydrogen or nr3r4 or one of a and b is hydrogen and the other is emi3.1 r is a saturated hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms; r1 and r2 independently of each other are hydrogen or a straight chain alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or one of r1 and r2 is hydrogen and the other a straight chain alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by an nh2 group; r and independently of each other are hydrogen or a straight chain alkyl group containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms; r5 is histidyl, tyrosyl, tryptophyl, arginyl, phenylalanyl or prolyl or an emi3.2 derivative of histidyl, tyrosyl, tryptophyl, phenylalanyl or prolyl; m is .1 or 2; n is 1 to 3, t is zero or 1, and when t is zero p is zero to 4 and when t is 1 p is zero; with
