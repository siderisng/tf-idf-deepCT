<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention relates to a method of transferring filaments collected in the form of wire, at the end of the permutation of two winding pins (B1-B2), the first, full, fading while the second, empty, collects the wire (F).According to this method, after moving the thread between the two pins so as to increase the arc (α0-α1) of contact with the empty spindle, the gradual break of the wire by abrasion, thus determining the separation of the filaments broken andTheir individual drive by adhesion on the empty spindle, until the complete recovery of said wire (F) by said spindle.It also relates to a method for carrying out the process, comprising a movable member (1) capable of moving and maintaining the wire between the pins until the transfer is made.The invention applies in particular to the manufacture of continuous glass wires.
