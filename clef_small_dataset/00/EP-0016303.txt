<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for spectroscopic material  analysis are provided.  two coherent beams of monochroma­ tic radiation are directed through a sample of material.  a  tuning mechanism adjusts the frequency difference between  the radiation beams to equal substantially the rotational fre­ quency of a preselected constituent of the material.  molecular  energy of a preselected constituent of the material is  increased, thereby producing a detectable signal in the form  of a pressure wave.  the signal is received by a detecting  mechanism which indicates the magnitude thereof.
