<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to powder metal articles  that can be successfully welded to ferrous base materials  and to methods of forming and welding such articles.  a  formed part having an initial part density of at least 5. 8  grams per cubic centimeter is subsequently compressed to  at least ninety-two per cent (92%) of theoretical full density  at a controlled area, including a contact area at which the  part is adapted to be welded to the other material and at  least a 0. 635 mm.  (. 025 inch) wide margin of the surface  laterally contiguous the contact area to a subsurface depth  of at least 0. 635 mm.  (. 025 inch) while retaining the initial  part density throughout the balance of the article.  such inÂ­ creased densification is accomplished by applying inwardly  directed, localized surface pressure against the controlled  area of the formed powder metal part.
