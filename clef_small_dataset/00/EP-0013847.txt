<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve chapel for internal combustion moisture. This chapel is characterized in that it is carried out in at least two complementary parts respectively upper (14) and lower (16) with transverse seal plane (17) cutting the longitudinal bulkhead (10) of the cavity 9 annually larger of the guide valve (2). This chapel further comprises an intermediate element (17) interposed between the upper part (14) and the lower part (16). This element (17) comprises at least two openings (19, 20) allowing a suitable circulation of the refrigerant fluid between the upper (21; 22) and lower (23; 24) parts of the same compartment (9a; 9b) of The cavity 9 and arranged so as to avoid using the direct communication of the refrigerant fluid between the terminities of arrival (9a) and return (9b) of the refrigerated fluid for at least two different angular positions of said two pieces. The invention applies in particular to the engines comprises with two exhaust valves, and therefore two chapels, by cylinder by allowing to use the same lower part 16 for the left and right chapels mounted on the cylinder.
