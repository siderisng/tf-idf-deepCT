<ABSTRACT>
a coupling for tubular scaffolding includes a boss 10  mounted on a standard 40 by a pin 42 or by welding and a  wedge ring 24 rotatably encircling and co-planar with the  boss.  radial insets 16 in the boss combine with the ring to  form apertures 30 in which pegs 32 are locatable, the pegs  being attached to the ends of ledgers 80 and transoms 82.   the inner face of the wedge ring has sloping wedge surfaces  28 in the vicinity of the apertures 30 which alter the radial  dimension of the apertures.  thus, when a peg is located in an  aperture the wedge ring can be rotated to wedge the peg  firmly in the aperture.  the problem existing prior to the invention was the difficulty  of securing ledgers and transoms.  this had to be done  by screw couplings or by getting above the coupling in order  to tighten it.  the coupling of the invention can be operated  from below, i. e.  by a person standing on erected scaffolding.
