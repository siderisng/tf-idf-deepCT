<ABSTRACT>
a hospital bed having a facility for tilting the mattress platform (16) to a foot-down configuration, the bed including a main frame (11) and a sub-frame (12) which carries the mattress platform (16), these being associated with each other (at 13) towards the foot end of the bed.  towards the head end of the bed, a member (22,23) is pivoted to the main frame (11) and the sub-frame (12) at separate spaced pivot points (24,25).  the member can be moved by manual operating means such as a worm arrangement (27,28) to change the relative positions of the pivot points (24,25) thereby changing the angular relationship between the main frame (11) and the sub-frame (12) to enable a slight foot-down tilt to be achieved.  the mechanism operates completely independently of any other facilities provided on the bed such as lifting and lowering facilities, head-down tilt facilities or contoured mattress supports.
