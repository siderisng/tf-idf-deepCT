<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to novel polyestercarbonate  copolymers in which bisphenol-a and trans-1,4-cyclohexane  dicarboxylic acid moieties are linked by ester and carbonate  links, optionally including other dibasic acid moieties, espe­ cially terephthalic and/or isophthalic moieties, in no greater  molar proportion than the cyclohexane dicarboxylic moiety.   these copolymers are melt processable; have high heat resis­ tance for a thermoplastic; have good impact and abrasion  resistance; and have good freedom from color even after  exposure to ultraviolet light.

<DESCRIPTION>
polyester-carbonates containing bisphenol-a and trans-1, 4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid moieties & process production thereof background of the invention it is known.to produce polyester-carbonate copolymers from bisphenol-a and certain dicarboxylic acids, in particular, adipic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. see u.s.p. 3,169,121 of february 9, 1965 to e. p. goldberg. this patent broadly suggests at column 3, lines 64-70 that the dicarboxylic acid can contain an alkylene, alkylidene, or cycloaliphatic group; and cites certain such groups at column 4, lines 7-33 including tetrahydroterephthalic acid, i.e. 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid etc.; but no specific teaching of how to make or use polyester-carbonate copolymers containing cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid is presented in the patent, or elsewhere in the prior art so far as we are aware. use of trans-1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid for production of alicyclic polybenzoxazinones is disclosed in the publication die makromolekulare chemie, volume 126 (1969) pages 48-55 by y. hagiwara et al. it is noted in this article that these alicyclic polymers are colorless whereas the corresponding aromatic polymers are tan or yellow colored (page 49, lines beneath the formulas). summary of the invention we have now found specific melt-processable polyester-carbonate copolymers of bisphenol-a (hereinafter called "bpa" and trans-1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid (hereinafter called "chda") moieties, having desirable properties oe low color, good impact strength and good abrasion resistance. our polyester-carbonate copolymers have viscosity number (i.e. specific viscosity divided by concentration) of at least 0.6 dl./g. measured at 250c. and 0.5 g./100cc. concentration in 40:60 weight ratio of tetrachloroethane:phenol solvent, and have mole ratio of the bpa:cdha moieties in the range between 2:0.4 and 2:1.3. (the molar proportion of carbonate moiety amounts to the difference between bpa and acid moieties.) the distribution is essentially random. these copolymers can additionally contain other dibasic acid moieties, in particular moieties of terephthalic ("tpa") and/or isophthalic acid in no greater molar proportion than the chda moiety. preferred emobodiments the examples which follow illustrate preferred embodiments of our invention, but the invention is not intended to be limited by the details of the examples. as seen in the examples, the copolymers of this invention are obtained using excess pyridine over the theoretical 2:1 mole ratio with bpa, and using several fold dilution of the pyridine with dichloromethane. example 1 132.8 grams of bpa (0.583 mole) was dissolved in 140 ml. of pyridine/1280 ml. of dichloromethane ("dcm) solvent. then 60 grams of trans-1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid dichloride ("chdc") (0.287 mole) dissolved in 500 ml of dichloromethane was added slowly at room temperature. to the resulting solution, phosgene was added by bubbling in with good stirring until the solution became viscous. then the solution, containing precipitated pyridinium hydrochloride, was further diluted with enough dcm to facilitate its filtration through a coarse sintered glass filter. after being filtered on the glass filter, the solution was poured with vigorous stirring into about 3 volumes of acetone whereby it was precipitated. the precipitate was filtered and dried; and dissolved in about 2 liters of dichloromethane, to which activated charcoal (2 grams) was added. after filtration
