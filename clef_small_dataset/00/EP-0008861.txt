<ABSTRACT>
a bearing repeater has a differential synchro (22) receiving an electrical signal dependent on the bearing of the repeater and mechanically geared to the bearing sight (20), the synchro output being supplied to a digital display (39) of which the reading is projected by optical means into the field of view of the sight.  a further digital display (38) can be provided for displaying the bearing of the sight outside the field of view.  the bearing sight can be locked to the repeater so that the bearing displayed is that of the repeater.
