<ABSTRACT>
disclosed are a glass-fiber-reinforced cement panel  and a process for its manufacturing, according to which a  cement slurry devoid of asbestos fiber consisting of 0. 5-­ 3. 0% by weight of glass fiber or glass fiber and polyvinyl  alcohol fiber in combination, and pulp in an amount 2-2. 5  times the total amount of glass fiber and polyvinyl alcohol  fiber, balance cement, is prepared; then, the cement slurry,  with 0. 005-0. 6% by weight of a cement flocculant added in  the midway as it is transferred from the chest to the bats,  is subjected to the hatschek sheetmaking process, thereby  forming the glass-fiber-reinforced cement panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
description title of the invention: a glass-fiber-reinforced cement panel and a process for its manufacture. technical field of the invention: the present invention relates to a glass-fiberreinforced cement panel manufactured by way of sheetmaking with a cement slurry, accordmg to claim 10 cd 11, and the manufacturing process thereof, according to clams 1 to 9. prior art: the process for manufacturing asbestos cement panels by way of sheet-making with cement slurries prepared by adding asbestos fiber to cement has heretofore been employed, and as a representative manufacturing process, the hatschek sheet-making process shown in an accompanying drawing is known. according to this sheet-making process1 at the pulper (1), cement, asbestos and water are mixed to produce a slurry, and this slurry is transferred to the chest (2). the slurry in the chest (2) is continuously fed to the bats (3); and the slurry in the bat is taken on the sheetmaking cylinder (4) in a sheet form. then, the sheet on the sheet-making cylinder (4) is transferred to the felt belt (5) running in contact with this cylinder (4), and the sheet on the felt belt (5) is, in turn, taken up by the making roll (6). as the sheet is taken up on this making roll to the predetermined thickness, the taken-up sheet is cut, and stripped off the making roll (6). it is, then, expanded flat, and after being passed through a press, is cured in a high temperature, high pressure steam, yielding a set cement panel. recently, this process has encountered some problems, including scanty supply of asbestos fiber, rising costs, and in addition, problems of work-site environment where asbestos fiber is handled, involving the adverse effect on human body of asbestos fiber scattered from weathered asbestos cement panels. to overcome such difficulties, search is now going on for other fibers to replace asbestos. disclosure of the invention the present inventors pursued investigations on the use of glass fiber in place of asbestos fiber. replacement of asbestos fiber with glass fiber, however, involves various problems. the glass fiber gives only slight dis persionin slurry, has smaller cement capturing capacity than asbestos fiber, and shows low sheet-making ability, since with glass fiber only, the cement particles in the slurry penetrate through the sheet-making cylinder, badly affecting the sheet-making with cement solids on the sheetmaking cylinder. in order to explore a suitable manufacturing method of the glass-fiber-reinforced cement panels, the present inventors have carried out studies on the possibility of sheet-making with cement slurries containing glass fiber by conducting the following experiments: experiment 1. in the mixed material of glass fiber which would be opened into mono-filaments in water, pulp and cement, the mixing rate of glass fiber was widely varied over 0.1 by weight1 and that of pulp over 0.1 - 10% weight. forty liters (40 2) of water was added to 2,000 g of this mixed material. this mixture was stirred for 150 seconds, and the dispersed state of glass fiber after the stirring was observed. the
