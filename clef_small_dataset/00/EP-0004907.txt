<ABSTRACT>
a glass forming machine having a plurality of sections  each of which includes a plurality of movable components  which operate in timed relationship with respect to one  another.  an electronic control system effects the automatic  synchronous operation of the various sections of the  machine to thereby automatically and continuously form  hollow glass articles.  an automatic override system monitors  each of the plurality of sections to determine whether  each of the plurality of movable components are in the  proper position at any given time.  if the aforementioned  movable components are not in the proper position at any  given time, the machine is either stopped or the operation  thereof modified to appropriately correct the operation of the  machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
backged or t invention this invention relates to an automatic override system for modifying the operation of glass forming machinery. the individual section or is glass forming machine, which is well-known in the art, has a plurality of glass forming means integrated into a single plural section machine fed by a single source of molten glass. the sections are operated in synchronism in such relative phase relationship as to permit the several sections to acquire gobs in ordered sequence from a single gob feeder. thus, as one of the sections is taking a gob from the gob feeder, another section is delivering 2 finished particle to an output conveyor and other sections are engaged in various forming steps intermediate the taking of a gob and the production of the finished ware. further, it has been customary to provide two molds rather than one in each section of an individual section machine whereby a gob is received in a first mold called the blank or parison mold, for the initial process of forming a parison, followed by transfer of the parison to a second mold, called the blow mold, for final blowing of the article. by this means each section of the machine is operating simultaneously upon two work pieces. in order to control the operation of the various functional components of the glass forming machine, a means must be provided for actuating each of the elements in a preselected cyclic time format so that the operation of one element does not interfere with, but rather complements, the operation of the other components. the several functional elements or components of the glass forming stations in the individual section machine are typically driven by pneumatic pressure which is controlled by an electronic timing circuit. an example of prior art controllers utilizing electronic timing means may be found in quinn et al, u.s. patent 3,762,907 and kwiatkowski et al, u.s.patent 3,969,703, both of which are assigned to the common assignee herewith. other examples of prior art electronic controllers may be found in croughwell u.s.patent 3,905,793, mylchreest et al u.s. patent 3,877,915, and, bublitz et al u.s.patent 4,007,028. each of these controllers typically includes a timing means for generating a machine cycle clock pulse train in -synchronism with the operation of a machine being controlled, wherein the cycle clock pulses provide an instantaneous indication of the time elapsed in each cycle of operation of the machine. a storage unit such as a random access memory or a shift register stores the relative times in the machine cycles when each of the plurality of components of the machine are to be actuated. a comparator then compares the output of the pulse generator which indicates the time elapsed in each cycle with the stored values in the storage unit. when a comparison is made an actuating signal is generated for indicating that the functioning of the machine component is to be either started, stopped, or modified. to determine which machine component is to be actuated, an
