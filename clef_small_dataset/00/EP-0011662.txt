<ABSTRACT>
vapour phase hydrolysis of scrap polyurethanes, espe­ cially flexible polyurethane foams, is improved through the  use of catalytic amounts of basically reacting alkali metal or  alkaline earth metal compounds applied to the foam prior to  hydrolysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
sp@cification title hyorolysis of polyurethan@s description this invention relates to the hydrolysis of polyurethanes. convertion of scrap polyurethane materials, especially polyurethane foams, by chemical metilods into useful decomposition products has received considerable recent attention. of the various approaches proposed for decomposition of polyurethane scrap, high temperature hydrolysis has the merit of minimizing the need for large amounts of organic solvents, as i.' required in accordance with other approaches. high teznprature hydroiysis, however, necessitates a choice between the desirable high reaction rates obtainable at high pressures, e.g., 30-60 atmosphgre, where relatively expensive pressure vessels are required for the reaction, and the undesirable slow reaction rates obtainable at low pressures where more conventional, but larger and cheaper equipment can be used. one attempt at upgrading low pressure processes is exemplified by u.s. serial no. 816,636, (german patent application p2831s832) wherein ammonia is introduced into a low pressure hydrolysis system. the reaction rates are however still relatively slow. according to the present invention, there is provided a method of hydrolysing polyurethane which comprises treating the polyurethane with superheated steam characterised in that the hydrolysis is effected in the presence of a basic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound. the basically reacting alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compounds provide a catalytic effect in the super heated hydrolysis of polyurethanea, especially polyurethane foams. remarkably in such reactions, basically reacting compounds (at low levels as compared to the amount of foam present) can increase hydrolysis rate by a factor of two or more in super heated steam where one would not expect liquid water to be present at any appreciable level. this invention is advantageously suitable for recovery of flexible polyurethane foams made by reacting a mixture comprising aromatic diisocyanate (e.g., toluene diisocyalete), high molecular weight polyol (e.g., polyether triol with number average molecular weight in excess of 1000 up to about 9000), and water in the presence of a small amount of amine or other catalysts, e,g., dimethylaminomorpholine triethylenediamine. other ingredients typically included in the form@l- ations are aurfactants, fillers, pigments and so forth most oftetl in minor amounts. other foams suitable include those jirepared from diisocyanates and polyestera such as esters of 1,4 butane diol and adipic aoid. still other foams as rigid and semi-flexible foams are typically made with similar ingredients but with the active hydrogen compound, e.g., polyol, being of lover molecular weight. decompoa- ition of any such foams that include ester type (e.g., urethane) linkages and amide type (e.g., urea) linkages predominantly constitute the preferred type of jiolyurethane scrap material that may be recover ea by hydrolysis according to the invention herein, polyurethane foam technology is described, for instance, in polyurethane, chemistry and technology, by j. h. saunders and k. c, friach, part ii technology, interscience publishers, new york (1967). in a currently preferred method of carrying out this invention an aqueous dilute solution, e.g., less than lo%i active, of the basically reacting compound is used to apply such compound uniformly on the polyurethane prior to its decomposition, one
