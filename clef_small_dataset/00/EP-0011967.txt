<ABSTRACT>
a labelling machine strips labels (1) from an continuously  advancing backing tape (2) and then applies the stripped  labels to objects continuously advancing on a conveyor.  the  labels are transferred from the backing tape to the objects  with the aid of a transfer mechanism (20).  the transfer  mechanism (20) has a continuously movable transfer  member (6) which picks up the labels at one position and  applies such labels to the objects at the second position, and  the movement of the transfer member at a pick-up position  may be at a rate and/or in a direction which differs from the  rate and/or direction of the advancement of the backing tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
labelling machines this invention relates to a machine for automatically applying labels to objects whilst such objects are advancing on a conveyor. with a known labelling machine, pressure sensitive adhesive backed labels are stripped from a backing tape, by passing the tape around an edge of a plate-shaped dispensing member, and the objects to be labelled are advanced past such edge so as to receive the labels directly therefrom. with this arrangement, in order to achieve rapid yet accurate labelling it will be appreciated that it is desirable for the direction and rate of feed of a label to be matched with the direction and rate of advancement of an object as the label is applied to the object; and this can only be achieved in the case where the objects are advanced in continuous manner at constant speed, by effecting intermittent feed of the labels, unless of course the label spacing on the backing tape is arranged to coincide with the spacing of the objects which is not practical in all cases. such intermittent feed is normally achieved-using a clutch and brake mechanism coupled to feed rollers for the label-carrying tape, or with a solenoid mechanism controlling engagement of a nip roller with a tape feed roller, under the control of devices which sense the positions of individual objects and labels. these known intermittent feed arrangements are however disadvantageous in that it is difficult to ensure reliable, trouble-free operation and careful control of the positioning of the labels on the objects whilst effecting the requisite continual acceleration and deceleration of the label-carrying tape. an object of the present invention is to provide a labelling machine with which labels carried on a backing tape can be stripped therefrom and applied to objects advancing in continuous manner on a conveyor without requiring intermittent feed of such tape. according to the invention therefore there is provided a labelling machine of the kind with which in use labels are stripped from an advancing backing tape and automatically applied to objects advancing on a conveyor, characterised in that said machine has a transfer mechanism which has at least one transfer member movable between a pick-up position at which it is operable to pick up a stripped label, and a release position at which it is operable to release such picked-up label for application to an advancing said object. with this arrangement, in so far as the rate and/or direction of movement of the transfer member need not be matched to the rate and/or direction of advancement of the backing tape it will be appreciated that the operation of the transfer mechanism can be so arranged as to ensure that stripped labels are presented to the advancing objects in a manner suited to rapid, accurate labelling even in the case where the rate and/or direction of advancement of the label-carrying backing tape is not so suited. thus there is no need to effect intermittent feed of the backing tape and such tape may be advanced
