<ABSTRACT>
a multi-hull craft comprises two spaced substantially  parallel hulls (14, 15) and a third hull (16) lying between the  lines of the two spaced hulls (14, 15) and/or extensions  thereof.  the third hull (16) is relatively movable with respect  to the two spaced hulls (14, 15) so as to have a different  heading from the two spaced hulls for steerage of the craft.  in order to enable the craft to be steered easily without  requiring the application of high steering forces by the  helmsman the two spaced hulls (14, 15) and the third hull  (16) are inflatable.
