<ABSTRACT>
a collapsible conical element, particularly in the form of  collapsible road marker cone.  comprises a base (1) which is  preferably relatively heavy, and a coiled strip (4), preferably  of a resilient.  plastics material, the outer turn of the strip  being restrained from pulling away from the base (1) on  extension of the coiled strip (4) to form a cone and the strip  (4) having at least two projections, one on each face thereof  disposed longitudinally and with the projection on the  radially outward face being below the projection on the  radially inward face when the cone is in the upright position  base down.  the base (1) is preferably a substantialiy planar  member.  eg thick rubber sheeting, with a substantially circu­ lar aperture (2) within which the outermost turn of the strip is  retained, either by virtue only of the resilience of the coiled  strip (4) or with additional fixing.  it is convenient to have the  radially outward projection at the bottom of the strip and to  provide a recess around the aperture in the base under which  this projection may be trapped.  for extending the strip to  form a cone a handle (11) may be provided which is insert­ able within the innermost turn of the coiled strip and which  has a flange which will engage the bottom edge of this turn  when the handle (11) is pulled upwards.  the strip (4), for  road marker use, may bear designs on those surfaces thereof  which are exposed when it is extended to form a cone.
