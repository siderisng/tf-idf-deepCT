<ABSTRACT>
apparatus is disclosed for generating electrical pulses in  response to rotation of a shaft (40).  the apparatus incorporates  an internal optical disc (56) carried by a hub (44)  assembly attached to the operating shaft, with the hub  assembly having a beveled bearing surface (68) at one end  thereof for engaging a similarly beveled surface (66) of the  apparatus housing (22), and biasing means (72) for biasing  the hub assembly (44) toward said housing beveled surface  (68) to compensate for mechanical wear and to also minimize  erratic movement of the optical disc (56).  the combination  of a light emitting diode (98) and photo-transistor (102)  generate electrical signals in response to the blocking and  transmitting of light through radially oriented opaque segments  of the disc during rotation.  the light emitting diodes  (98) and phototransistors (102) are retained by receptacles  (82) which snap fit within cooperating apertures of the  housing.  a second combination of light emitting diode (82)  and photo-transistor (102), together with a second stationary  disc (112) provide two phase shifted signals which can  reduce problems caused by jitter, backlash and the like.
