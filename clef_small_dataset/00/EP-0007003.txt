<ABSTRACT>
address translation apparatus is provided for translating  virtual addresses to real storage addresses and real storage  addresses to virtual storage addresses.  the address transla足 tion apparatus uses a page directory having a next real  address and an associated virtual address ordered according  to real addresses.  this simplifies the manner in which the  input output (i o) handles addressing in a virtual storage  computer system.  when the i o device control mechanism  needs to resolve the real i o address register, it uses the  contents of that register to index into the page directory to  obtain a corresponding virtual address.  the corresponding  virtual address is incremented and converted to a real address  which is used to index into the page directory.  the virtual  address taken from the page directory is then compared with  the virtual address which had been incremented and trans足 lated.  if the two compare then the real address which had  been used to access the page directory is entered into a regis足 ter so as to be available as a real main storage address.  in  actuality it is only a partial real main storage address and is  concatenated with a byte identifier portion of the main stor足 age address wliich requires no translation and which was a  part of the original i o real address for main storage.
