<ABSTRACT>
By incorporating cores in unidirectionally enhanced fiber composite parts, their high tensile strength in the fiber direction can be widely used because they can be better anchored without special effort.The cross-section of the nuclei must change in fiber direction, and it is important that the fibers are gleamed to the core and it is completely embedded.The nucleused fiber composite parts can be produced continuously.In the impregnating bath, the central region of the glass fiber bundle is widened, the core insert inserted into this area and subsequently the fibers are pressed to the core.
