<ABSTRACT>
an extrusion die having lattice-like slits (2′) of very  small width (i′) can be easily obtained by plating a metal  film (4) on the surface of slits (2) in the matrix (1) of the  die.  a honeycomb structural body produced by the use of  the extrusion die has a very high cell density and a very  large surface area, and is suitable as a catalyst carrier for  the purification of exhaust gas of automobile.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: method of producing a die for extruding a ceramic batch into a honeycomb structural body and a die produced by such method background of the invention the present invention relates to a method of producing die for extruding a ceramic batch into a honeycomb structural body. there has been known a ceramic honeycomb structural body having a large number of parallel cells, which are confined by a relatively thin lattice-like partition wall and extend therethrough in its axial direction, and having an open frontal area of about 60-90 h, preferably 65-85%. such kind of honeycomb structural body has been used for the catalyst carrier for the purpose of purifying harmful co, hc and no from the exhaust gas by passing the exhaust gas through the cells so as to react it with a catalyst supported on the surface of the partition wall. the honeycomb structural body is manufactured by a method, wherein a ceramic batch is extruded through the extrusion die into a ceramic honeycomb shaped body, and the shaped body is dried and fired, as described in u.s. patent specification no. 3,824,196. when the above described ceramic honeycomb structural body having a catalyst supported on the partition wall of cell is used for purifying harmful gases in an exhaust gas, the exhaust gas is passed through the honeycomb structural body to react the exhaust gas with the catalyst. therefore, the reaction area must be large and the pressure loss of the exhaust gas must be low. in order to increase the reaction area of a honeycomb structural body in a limited volume of a purifying apparatus for exhaust gas, the thickness of the partition wall is preferred to be as small as possible. if the dimension between partition walls are decreased without changing the thickness of partition wall in order to increase the cell density, a large reaction area can be obtained, but the pressure loss of the exhaust gas becomes high, and the use of such honeycomb structural body is disadvantageous. a honeycomb structural body having a thin partition wall can be obtained by the use of an extrusion die having a small slit width. however, the slit of such extrusion die has hitherto been produced by the abrasion machining with the aid of a grinder, by the milling machining and by the electric discharge machining subjected to steel. therefore, the limit of the slit width, which is able to be formed by the above described machining with respect to slits having a given depth, is as large as about 0.30 mm. the production of slits having a width smaller than 0.3 mm is very difficult due to the production accuracy of grinder, milling blade and discharge electrode and due to the machining accuracy when the slits are formed by the use of these tools. further, japanese examined patent publication no. 20,435/76 discloses that a honeycomb structural body having a round shape at the crossing corner of partition walls lets the exhaust gas flow smoothly and improves
