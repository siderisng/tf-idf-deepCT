<ABSTRACT>
Device for controlling the operations required for feeding a sheet of paper in a rotating cylindrical platinum printer, ali rollers and clipboard rod. The device comprises a tilting button (31) whose operation by the operator, causes the start of a motor (4) which makes a cam (10) turns. The rotation of the cam (10) causes the bidirectional rotation of a shaft (14) which trains a control comb (20). The rotation of the comb (20) in a first direction causes the removal of the rear roller (61) of the piatine (68), in order to allow in seal of a sheet of paper and causes the establishment of a paper alignment element. The rotation of the comb (20) in the opposite direction, causes the paper stretch between the rear roller (61) and the plate (68). The cam (10) during its rotation also causes the tilting of an arm (22) which ensures the removal and the reconciliation of the clipboard rod by rap port at the plate (68).
