<ABSTRACT>
trialkylamines are made by the action of hydrogen on a  dialkylamine and a ketone in the presence of a metal sulfide  catalyst.  e. g. , hydrogenation of a mixture of dibutylamine and  cyclohexanone, using platinum sulfide catalyst, produces  n, n-dibutylcyclohexylamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a method of making trialkylamines there are several references that describe the reductive alkylation of dialkylamines with ketones to produce trialkylamines. however, we know of no prior art o the use of metal sulfide catalysts for this reaction. schmerling, in u.s, 3,247,209 (april 19, 1966), has described the use of a sulfided platinum catalyst for the reductive alkylation of secondary alicyi:lic amines in which the nitrogen atom is part of a hetirocyclic ring, specifically, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- quinolines, with ketones. this invention is concerned with the use of metal sulfide catalysts, such as the sulfides of iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, molybdenum, tungsten and rhenium, for the reductive alkylation of dialkylamines with ketones. emi1.1 emi1.2 <tb> <sep> r1 <sep> r3 <tb> crit. <sep> k-ck <sep> + <sep> h20 <tb> <sep> r <sep> r <tb> <sep> i <tb> and rê may be the same or different and may be alkyl groups of from 1 to 18 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl groups of from 5 to 8 carbon atoms. r and r4 may be the same or different and may be alkyl groups of from 1 to 17 carbon atoms or r3 and r4 taken together may form a polymethylene group having 4 to 5 carbon atoms or an alkyl substituted polymethylene group having 6 to 9 carbon atoms. examples of useful dialkylamines are dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, dibutylamine, diicobutylamine, di-sec-butylamine, di amylamine, diisoamylamine, dfhexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, diheptylamine, dioctylamine, bis(l-methylheptyl) amine, 2,2'-diethyldihexylamine, didecylamine, didodecyl amine, n-methylbutylamine, n-ethylbutylamine, n-methylcyclohexylamine, n-ethylcyclohexylamine, n-isopropylcyclohexylamine, n-methyloctadecylamine, n-methylcyclodecylamine n,n'-diethylethylenediamine, n,n-dimethyl-n' -ethylethylenediamine, n,n,n'-triethylethylenediamine, n,n,n'-trimethylethylenediamine, n,n'-diethyl-1,3-propanediamine, n,n'-dimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, etc. examples of useful ket-ones are acetone, 2-butanone, dihexyl ketonc, 2,6-dimethyl-3-heptanone, 2,6dimethyl-4-heptanone, 3,5-dimethyl-4-heptanone, 2,4dimethyl-3-pentanone, 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentanone, 2heptanone, 3-heptanone, 4-heptanone, 2-hexanone, 3hexanone, mesithyl oxide, 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 5-methyl 2-hex:.none, 3-methyl -2-pentancne, lo-nonadec anone, 2-nonanone, 5-nananone, 2-octanone, 3-octanone, 4 octanone, 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, 2-undecanone, 6undecanone, isophorone, cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone, 3-methylcyclohexanone,4-t-butylcyclohexanone, etc. the hydrogenation process may be carried out in the absence of any solvent mecium, or in the presence of an inert organic. solvent, including, for example, aliphstic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl al alcohol, butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, tert-amyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, octyl alcohol, 2-etbylbexanol, decyl alcohol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, hexadecanol, octadecanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, etc; ethers, such as diethyl ether cipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl butyl ether, ethyl.butyl ether,dibutyl ether, diamyl ether, diisoainyl ether, dihexyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dibutyl ether, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran; alcohol-ethers, such as diethylene glycol, trietlylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol , tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 2- butoxyethanol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, etc; esters, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isoprcpyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, methyl amyl acetate, 2-ethylhexyl acetate, diethyl succinate, etc; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propeionitrile, butyronitrile, etc; amides, such as formamide, acetamide, propionamide, n,n-dimethylformamide, n,n-diethylformamide, n,n-dimethylacetamide, n,n-diethylacetamide, etc; hydro carbors, such as hexane, 2-metaylpentame, 3-methylpentmle, 2,2-dimethylbutane,2,3-dimethylbutane, cyclohexane, heptane, 3-methylhexane, octane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, 2,3,4-trimethylpentane, decane, decalin, benzene, toluene,xylenes, etc. preferred solvents are the
