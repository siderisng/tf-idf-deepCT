<ABSTRACT>
a method of refining crude lead from copper-contain­ ing lead raw-materials which possibly also contain arsenic  and which are of a metallic, oxidic, sulphatic or sulphidic  type, in a furnace in which the contents thereof can be sub­ jected to turbulence, preferably in a top blown rotary con­ verter, for example, of the kaldotype.  according to the in­ vention, subsequent to chemical reduction and tapping-off  of the slag, the crudelead melt is cooled to a temperature  beneath about 700°c whilst strongly agitating said melt,  in order to separate out a copper phase or a copper speiss.   the coolant used may be an oxidic or sulphatic lead raw-­ material, a crushed iron-silicate slag, a slag former, and,  preferably, water in liquid finely-divided form, large quan­ tities of arsenic can be removed prior to said cooling, by  forming an iron speiss, by adding iron to the crude-lead  melt or forming iron in situ therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of refining crude lead the present invention relates to a method of producing crude lead from copper-containing lead raw-materials of a metallic , oxidic, sulphatic or sulphidic type. metallic lead is normally produced from sulphidic lead raw-materials , such as lead concentrates for example, but can also be produced from oxidic and sulphatic lead raw-materials , for example dust, ashes and slags. the most common furnace used for melting and chemically reducing lead is the shaft furnace, to which there is charged a lead raw,material which, if so desired, has been pre-sintered or roasted to simultaneously oxidize the sulphidic sulphur present with atmospheric oxygen to a content of less than 2 sulphur. the lead raw-material can also be melted and reduced, to advantage, in a rotary , inclined furnace, as disclosed in swedish patent specification 7317217-3 and 7317219-9, which teach methods for producing crude lead from sulphidic, oxidic and sulphatic lead raw-materials. when producing crude lead, i.e. lead which must be purified or refined in order to be retailed as a normal market product, the lead will thus practically always contain impurities undesirable in the finished lead, e.g. such impurities as copper, arsenic and antimony, which substances must therefore be removed from the crude lead. gold and silver are normally also present in the crude lead. irrespective of the method by which the crude lead is produced, it must therefore be refined in order that a sufficiently pure, final lead product can be obtained. normally, the crude lead is refined in so-called pots or chambers of various type , especially designed for refining said lead with respect to said impurities. copper, and also arsenic and antimony present in the lead , constitute a particular problem when refining said lead. arsenic and antimony may be present in quantities of up to about 15%, which results in the formation of very large quantities of solid, powderous products which float to the surface of the metal bath during the refining process. this so-called dross renders handling of the crude-lead melt difficult. when copper is present in the lead rawsmaterials in large quantities , it is essential that it is possible to remove the copper effectively at an early stage of the process, so as not to render the process more expensive by the fact that the further treatment of the lead to a refined lead is made more difficult and since the copper content of the lead is highly valuable. according to the invention, crude lead is produced from copper-containing lead raw-materials of a metallic, oxidic, sulphatic or sulphidic type, by melting the raw materials in a furnace in which turbulence can be created in the contents thereof, said raw materials being melted in the presence of a slag former and chemically reduced, whereafter a slag is tapped-off. the novel method is characterized by the fact that subsequent to tapping-off the slag, the crude-lead melt formed is cooled whilst creating a strong turbulence thereinto a temperature above the liquidus point of
