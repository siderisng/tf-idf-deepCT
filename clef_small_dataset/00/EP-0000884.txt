<ABSTRACT>
an aminoplastic precondensate comprising an aqueous solution of urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde condensation products which have been partially etherified using methanol, the molar ratio between urea and melamine condensation products being from 1:0. 2 to 0. 65, based on urea or melamine, and the degree of etherification of the methylol groups being from 40 to 75% and the partially etherified urea-formaldehyde condensation product being predominantly in the form of partially etherified dimethylolurone and the partially etherified melamine-formaldehyde condensation product being predominantly in the form of partially etherified hexamethylolmelamine, is prepared by condensing urea with, based on 1 mol of urea, 8-12 mol of formaldehyde in aqueous solution at a ph above 11 and at a temperature of from 45 to 55 deg c, then adding from 0. 2 to 0. 65 mol of melamine, continuing the condensation at 65-80 deg c for from 10 to 20 minutes and then etherifying the product at 30-40 deg c and at a ph of less than 3 using from 17 to 23 mol of methanol, neutralising the etherified product and subsequently evaporating the solution.  the aminoplastic precondensate is used to crosslink polymers containing oh groups.
