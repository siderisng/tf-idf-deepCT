<ABSTRACT>
water of low solids content is purified by ion exchange  treatment in separate beds with anion and cation exchange  resins, the rate of flow of water through the last bed at least  being fast.  the beds are usually shallow and the flow rate  through the last bed at least, and generally through all the  beds, is generally at least 100 metres per hour.  apparatus  suitable for use in such a process comprises a tower (14)  including supports (15, 16, 17) for holding the beds (9, 10, 11)  one above the other and means (6, 7) for passing the water to  be treated vertically through the tower.  the apparatus is also  suitable for use in other processes for purification of water of  low solids content by ion exchange.
