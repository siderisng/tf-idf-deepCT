<ABSTRACT>
n-(aminomethyl)-α,β-ethylenically unsaturated cationic  carboxamides such as n-(dimethylaminomethyl)-acrylamide  are readily prepared without coincident production of saturated  impurities by reacting and α,β-ethylenically unsaturated  carboxamide such as acrylamide with a lower aldehyde such  as formaldehyde and a secondary amine such as dimethylamine  at a ph below 7.  the resulting aminomethyl carboxamides  are polymerized at a ph of 7 or less to form polymers  containing essentially no gelled product.  the resulting  aminomethyl carboxamides can also be quaternized by  reacting them with a quaternizing agent at a ph below 7.  this  quaternized products can be polymerized.  the polymerisation  products are flocculants.
