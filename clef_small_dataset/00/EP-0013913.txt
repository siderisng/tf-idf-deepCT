<ABSTRACT>
an anti-reversal device is provided whereby a wheel  (10) and shaft (11) are free to rotate in one sense (b)  relative to a stationary member (12) but are prevented  from counter-rotating in the sense (c) by engagement of  load-bearing pins (26) between teeth (16 and 17) of the  respective members (10, 12).  the pins (26) are positively  driven to the operative positions in which they are shown  by a control ring (19) which is free to rotate with the  wheel (10) in the permitted sense (b) but prevented from  rotating in the other sense (c) by the engagement of se足 condary pins (24) between teeth (21) on the inner peri足 phery of the control ring (19) and secondary teeth (20)  on the stationary member (12).  if the wheel (10) tends  to counter-rotate in the sense (c) the teeth (16) of the  wheel (10) drive the pins (26) down the slots (25) in the  arrested control ring (19) to their operative positions.   when rotation of the wheel (10) recommences in the  permitted sense (b) the tendency of the control ring (19)  to lag behind causes the pins (26) to be displaced to the  radially outer ends of the slots (25) so that there is no  friction between the pins (26) and the teeth (17) of the  stationary member (12).  in the modification the secondary pins (24), the se足 condary teeth (20) on the stationary member (12) and  the recesses (21) in the inner periphery of the control  ring (19) are dispensed with and their functions are per足 formed by additional pins betwee the teeth (16) and (17)  located in slots in the control ring (19) which have an  opposite inclination to the remaining slots (25).
