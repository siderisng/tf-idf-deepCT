<ABSTRACT>
radiation detection apparatus includes a first detector  (6) for detecting radiation at a wavelength which is  preferably in the infra-red region, and means for sensing  the presence of an obturating element (11), which element  acts to prevent operating of the first detector.  the sensing  means includes a transmitter (14) which transmits a  signal at a second wavelength, and a second detector (15)  responsive to and arranged to receive the signal in the  presence of the obturating element, preferably by reflection  of the signal from the element.  an alarm (10) may be  activated in response to detection of radiation or of the  transmitted signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements in and relating to intruder alarms" this invention relates to radiation detection apparatus and will be described particularly with reference to pyroelectric passive infra-red intruder detection apparatus, that is, to apparatus responsive to infra-red radiation emitted by an unauthorised entrant into a space at a time when the space should be empty. such apparatus works on the principle that a change in infra-red radiation within its field of view is detected by the apparatus the change in detected radiation produces an electrical signal which is amplified and filtered before being applied to a level detector circuit which operates an alarm. the detecting element may be at the focal point of a concave parabolic or spherical mirror which will provide a single zone a sensitivity having strongly directional characteristics. alternatively, the detecting element may be located at the focal point of an array of mirrors which can conveniently be arranged to produce a number of widely spaced radial zone of sensitivity. if those zones are arranged suitably, a large space can be covered by one detecting element a disadvantage of both these systems is that their zones of sensitivity can be partially or totally obscured by placing tiiermally opaque matcrial over their apertures. such material severely attenuates radiation in the range of wavelengths of interest, which range is typically between i and 20 microns and so approximately centred on 10 microns wavelength. if this is done, any change in radiation caused by an intruder will not be detected and the alarm will not be activated. this aspect places a serious limitation on the use of passive infra-red detectors for security purposes. the present invention provides radiation detection apparatus comprising first detecting means for detecting radiation at a first wavelength, first indicating means responsive to said first detecting means, characterised in that means for sensing the presence of an obturating element preventing the operation of said first detecting means are provided, said sensing means comprising transmitting means for transmitting a signal at a second wavelength, second detecting means responsive to the signal at the second wavelength in the presence of the obturating element, and second indicating means responsive to said second detecting means. in the prefcrred cmbodiment, the first detecting means is arranged to be sensitive to infra-red radiation at between 4 and 20 microns. the transmitting and second detecting means are so disposed that the detecting means will only detect the transmitted signal if the signal is reflected from an obturating element. preferably, this is achieved using a single concave spherical or parabolic mirror for not only the transmitted signal but also for the detected radiation in order to reduce interaction between the two detecting means, a different wavelength is chosen for the second detecting means which falls outside the range of sensitivity of the first detecting means but which preferably is also within the infra-red region.preferably, to further reduce interaction, the transmitted signal at the second wavelengtl1 is pulsed at a certain frequency aiid tlic apparatus is arranged to
