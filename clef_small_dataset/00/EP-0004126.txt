<ABSTRACT>
a solar heat collector panel is made up of an array of parallel extruded aluminium absorber elements (1) with internal longitudinal flow ducts (4) each element being extruded with integral lateral fins (5) of tapering thickness exposed on one face to solar radiation (12) and backed on the opposite face by thermally insulating material (9).  the internal flow ducts may be interconnected by manifolds at opposite ends and heat exchange by fluid flowing through each duct is enhanced by internal longitudinal ribs (6) in the duct.  in a reversible version of the absorber element the entire element is rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the duct from a heat absorbing position in which a blackened face (16) is exposed to solar radiation through a transparent cover (17) to a re-radiating position in which the face re-radiates heat, for example into a horticultural enclosure.  the cover is hinged and moves away from the exposed face as the element is rotated into its re-radiating position.
