<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of conference connections in a time division multiplex system, accordingly, to form the intermediate sum code words, which are stored in each case in the one half of a conferencing memory (K1, K2), total sum code word words, which are read more several times during the timing associated with the conference participants and of which each of which is subtracted by a pulse frame-delayed PCM word of each other conference subscriber. If the PCM words of conference participants to which are assigned directly adjacent timings to be summed up to the formation of intermediate codeworts or total code words, the intermediate sum code word supplied by the adder (addiction), bypassing the conferencing memory (K1, K2), is directly to the Adder (Add) returned. At the same time, however, it is also enrolled in the conferencing memory (K1, K2), but from there only read again when it is a total code word. This ensures that the adder (add) is also available in this case the PCM words to be summed. The method according to the invention is particularly suitable for the extension plants operating in time-multiplexing operation.
