<ABSTRACT>
in such a reel, the expansion mandrel (1) essentially consists of expansion mandrel segments (3, 4) which are radially adjustable via a wedge gear.  in order to obtain a gap-free mandrel surface in the expanded mandrel position, the expansion mandrel segments (3, 4) are connected alternately to the reel shaft (5) and the expansion mandrel shaft (2) so as to be fixed in displacement in the axial direction, and, in respect of their width, designed alternately extended and tapered in a diametrically opposed wedge-shaped fashion against the reel shaft (5).  in this arrangement, the gear wedges (15), which are secured against a displacement by the reel shaft (5) and interact with the expansion mandrel segments (4) taken along axially by the expansion mandrel shaft (2), are axially displaceably supported on the expansion mandrel shaft (2).  <image>
