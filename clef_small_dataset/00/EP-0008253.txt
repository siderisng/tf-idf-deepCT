<ABSTRACT>
1.  automatic grab, for taking up or releasing an object by means of a single suspending and operating cable (6), and comprising : - a hollow cylindrical body (1), - a slide (5) connected to the suspension cable (6) and capable of moving with respect to the hollow body (1) between a high extreme position in which the hollow body is free and supported by the slide, and a low extreme position in which the body bears on an object and supports the slide, - gripping members (10, 14, 43) solid with the body in axial movement and capable of being moved radially between a gripping position in which they engage with interacting gripping elements (3) of the object, and a relaxed position in which they release the object, - means for transforming the relative movement of the slide in the body into a radial displacement movement of the gripping members, - a bolt (22) with variable orientation, articulated on the slide, and whose orientation is altered, with the slide in the low position, by a fixed finger (26) solid with the body, the given orientation bringing the bolt, depending on its previous orientation, either into a retracted position allowing the slide (5) to return completely to its high extreme position, or to a locking position limiting the return of the slide to an intermediate position, wherein the region of the slide (5) moving in front of the gripping members (10, 14, 43) has parts (18-20, 30-32), of different diameters on which interacting operating elements of each of the gripping members bear, and so defined that the gripping members are in the gripping position when the slide is in the high extreme position, and in the relaxed position when the slide is in the intermediate position, characterized by the fact that the relative axial positions of the various parts (18-20, 30-32) of different diameters of the slide (5) are so defined that, from the intermediate locked position in which the gripping members (10, 14, 43) are in the relaxed position, the relative travel of the slide (5) towards the bottom of the body (1) necessary for setting them in the gripping position is less than the travel necessary for allowing a change in orientation of the bolt (22).
