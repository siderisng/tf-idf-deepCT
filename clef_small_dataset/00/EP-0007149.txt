<ABSTRACT>
to produce resin-impregnated fibres for use as a mould­ ing composition for fibre-reinforced resin composites, a fibre  tow (10) is chopped (12), fluidised and conveyed through a  first flow-accelerating device (21) dispersed into a mixing  chamber (30) where it is turbulently admixed with dry pow­ dered resin injected into the chamber.  the resin-impregnated  fibres are withdrawn from the chamber (30) via a second  flow-accelerating device (41) into a separating tank (50) in  which the fluiding medium is separated from the resin-­ impregnated fibres.
