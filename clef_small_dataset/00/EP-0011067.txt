<DESCRIPTION>
tricyclic chemical compounds and their production this invention relates to prostaglandin antagonists. prostaglandin antagonists are useful in treating a variety of conditions, such as allergic asthma where excessive contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates occur. the prostaglandin antagonists of the present invention are 7- and 8-substituted-dibenzo[b,f)thiepins having the structural formula : emi1.1 in which n is q or an integer from 1 to 4; z is thio, sulfinyl, or sulfonyly r is hydrogen, halogen including chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine, amino, c1-4 alkyl, c1-4 alkanoyl, kydroxyl, c34 alkoxy, mercapto, c1-4 alirylthio, c1-4 alkylsulfilryl, c1-4 alkylsulfonyl, trif)uorotnethyl, trifluoromet,hyltbio, cyano, carbon nitro, c1-4 alkylamino or di(c1-4alkyl)amino; a is 5-tetrazolel, 3-hydror-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl, 4-hydrox -2,5- dioxo 83-pfrrolin-s-yi or emi2.1 where r2 is hydroxy, c1-4 alkoxy , n,n-2i(cl ealtyl)amino-(cl 4 alkoxy), c1-4 hydroxyalk xrç carboxy-(cl 4 alkoxy), amino, c1,4 alkylamino, ditcl 4 alkyl)amino, c1-4 alkylsulfonylamino, carboxy(cl 4 alkyl )amino, carbamoyl(c1-4 alkyl)amino or 2-imino3-methylthiazolioine and the dotted line indicates either an olefinic bond or saturation at the 10-, ll-position; and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. as used herein, the term, halogen (or halo), means chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine. unless otherwise specifically stated, the term lower alkyl and loweralkoxy means straight and branched chain alkyl and alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkoxy residue, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy and isobutoxy. the term loweralkanoyl includes straight or branched chain alkanoyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkanoyl residue, for example, formyl, acetyl, propanoyl, isobutyryl and isotutyryl. these dibenzo [b,fà thiepin desivatives antag- onize the actions of contractile prostaglandins, such as pgg2 =d and pgh2 and txa,. the use of agents which act as prostaglandin antagonists offers new approaches to therapy in a a number of disease states. for example, certain prostaglandins, such as pgf2z, pgg2 and pgei2, are potent contractants of bronchial muscle. indeed human asthmatics have been shown to be especially sensitive to the bronchial constricting action of pgf2as in addition to the involvement of contrac- tile prostaglandins in chronoc obstructive lung disease (or asthma), prostaglandins are know to play a role in other allergic conditions, as well as inflammation, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, platelet aggregation, cerebral spasm, premature abortion, and dismenonorrhea. in addition to the prostaglandin antagonist actions, the dibcnzotb,flthiepins of this invention are antagonists of sl reacting substance of anaphylaxis (srs-a). this contractile substance is released in the lung tissue in allergic asthma, and antagoninm of its actions contributes to alleviation of this disease. the dibenzo [b,f] thiepins of this invention are prepared according to the follving general reaction scheme. an appropriately substituted mercaptobenzoic acid ii is is reacted with sr-dibromobenzene iii (r3-br) to obtain the 0- (3-bromophenyl) benzoic acid zv. or alter- natively, an approrriately substituted o-bromobenzoic acid ii (r2-lnr) is reacted with m-bromobenzenethiol iii to sh) to give 1v, emi3.1 where rú is hydrogen, nitro, amino, c14 alkanoyl, hydroxy c14 alkoxy, c14 alkyisulfinyl, c1¯4 alkylsulfonyl, c1-4 alkyl, trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethyithic. r2 and 5 are different: one of
