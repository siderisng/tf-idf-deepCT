<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a simple and rugged, wide-Â­ range radiation monitor adapted for use at various locations  around a nuclear reactor plant.  an emitter plate (e) of a high atomic number material is  positioned between collector plates (c1, c2) of a low atomic  number material and the ionization current developed in the  gap regions therebetween in response to low radiation fields  and the self-powered current developed in response to high  radiation fields is measured by a current measuring circuit  (m) as an indication of impinging radiation.  the spacing  between the collector and emitter plates and accordingly the  gas volume defined therebetween is great enough that the  ionization current dominates the self-powered current at low  radiation fields.

<DESCRIPTION>
wide range radiation monitoring apparatus this invention relates to an improved radiation monitoring apparatus having a wide range response. in order to meet the safety regulations imposed on facilities associated with the storage, use or disposition of radioactive materials used in nuclear reactors, or the monitoring of an accident situation, there is a critical requirement for a radiation monitoring apparatus which is both rugged and reliable, and capable of indicating fields from 1 r/hr up to 108 r/hr and continue to operate even if exposed to high radiation doses and/or temperatures of up to approximately 2500c. such an apparatus would find wide-spread use for monitoring radiation fields present at various locations around a nuclear power plant as well as monitoring radiation fields in stored fuel areas, high-level waste areas, as well as monitoring the activity in the primary coolant of a nuclear reactor. it is an object of this invention to provide an improved radiation monitoring apparatus with a view to overcoming the deficiencies of the prior art. the invention resides in a wide range radiation detector apparatus comprising a first collector element and a second collector element being spaced apart, an emitter element positioned between said first and second collector elements, said collector elements being constructed of a material which is different from the material of said emitter element, said materials being of different work functions and different atomic numbers, the work functions of said dissimilar materials producing a contact potentialbetween said collector elements and said- emitter element and resulting in an ionization current, the difference in the atomic number of the materials of said collector elements and said emitter element causing higher energy electrons to be ejected from the higher atomic number material than the lower atomic number material and resulting in a self-powered current, and current measuring means being operatively connected to said collector elements and said emitter element to provide a measurement of incident radiation, characterized in that the spacing between said collector elements and said emitter element and accordingly the gas volume defined therebetween is great enough that the ionization current dominates the self-powered current at low radiation fields. in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a simple and rugged detector capable of measuring radiation fields over the range of 8 0.02 r/hr up to 10 r/hr or higher. it is basically a combination of an ionization device and self-powered device which does not require an external power supply. the detector consists of an emitter element of high atomic number material which is connected to the center conductor of a signal cable. this emitter element is positioned in a spaced apart relationship between collector elements of a low atomic number material with a gap region between the emitter element and the adjacent collector elements. the presence of a radiation field of gamma rays ejects electrons from both the emitter and collector elements which produce ionization in the gap regions. in low radiation fields the device functions in an ionization mode
