<ABSTRACT>
in a practically applicable process for producing lacquers and dispersion paints, one or more, preferably four, tinting colours accommodated in film bags (5) which dissolve in lacquers and dispersion paints are added to a basic colour in the desired tint- dependent amount and stirred.  in order to be able to tint a colour, it is no longer necessary to weigh out various pigment pastes, but it is now possible for the first time to work according to a given formula and to introduce, very accurately proportioned, the amount of tinting pastes in the form of the bags containing this amount directly into the coating compound, the bags dissolving completely.  a particularly advantageous, well arranged and space-saving storage of the paints is made possible, the tinting paints being accommodated in soluble paint bags which should not come into contact with the surrounding air.  the tinting paint bags constitute the storage means and the proportioning unit.  <image>
