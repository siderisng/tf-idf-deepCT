<ABSTRACT>
in steering mechanisms for motor vehicles, variable transmission ratios are aimed at between the steering column (3) and the steering shaft (8) carrying a steering rod lever (7).  without servoassistance, because of the generally increasing steering forces when the wheels are being steered for turning, the transmission ratio is intended to become greater ("more indirect") as the wheel steering increases, to keep the steering wheel forces in limits.  with servoassistance, which allows the steering forces to be absorbed without effort, the transmission ratio is intended to become smaller ("more direct") as the wheel steering increases, in order to keep the number of steering wheel rotations required, for example for parking, small.  to facilitate this, the output drive shaft (6) of the actual geartrain (2) is connected to the steering shaft (8) via a universal joint (2), the output drive shaft (6) and the steering shaft (8) moreover being inclined with respect to one another.  in order to provide a "more direct" transmission when the wheels are in the straight position, the axis of rotation (14) of the universal joint (2) connected to the steering shaft (8) runs perpendicular to the plane (e) containing the axes (10, 11) of the steering shaft (8) and the output drive shaft (6) when the wheels are in the straight position.  in order to provide a more "indirect" transmission when the wheels are in the straight position, the said axis of rotation (14) runs in this plane (e).
