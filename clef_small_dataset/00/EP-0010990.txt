<ABSTRACT>
a chair control employing an open top, generally rec­ tangular, drawn cup (11) for housing an energy stor­ age package (12).  an axle (20) secured to and extending  between stretchers (15, 16) which are secured to a tilting  chair or member thereof, is journalled in the drawn cup and  carries the energy storage package.  means (88) for adjusting  the preload of the energy package and reducing the likeli­ hood of an energy package failure are provided.  first (21)  and second (22) interlocking spindle support members are  provided which form a cup reinforcing and stress distribut­ ing structure roughly box-shaped in cross section.  the four  outsids corners of the cup are strengthened by indented  sidewall portions (60-63).  a strengthening flange (56) is dis­ posed about the periphery of the cup and the axle, journal­ led in the cup, has a relatively large diameter for distributing  stress.
