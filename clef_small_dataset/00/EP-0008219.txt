<ABSTRACT>
charge transfer apparatus is described which inclu­ des a semiconductor substrate (13) of one conductivity ty­ pe provided with a mobile charge source (35) in the form  of a region of opposite conductivity type.  a reference vol­ tage is applied to a first electrode (36) overlying a first re­ gion of the substrate.  a signal voltage is applied to a se­ cond electrode (37) overlying a second region of the sub­ strate.  two identical clock signals are then applied respec­ tively to third and fourth electrodes (30) and (26) overlying  the substrate.  one of these clock signals is differentiated  by a cr network to provide a voltage (vd) for pulsing the  charge source (35).  in operation, charge is transferred  from the charge source (35) to a storage region beneath  the second electrode (37) during an initial part of a first  half of each clock cycle and, during the remainder of each  first half cycle, excess charge is transferred back from the  region beneath the second electrode (37) to the charge  source (35) over a potential barrier region beneath the re­ ference electrode (36) during the second half of the clock  cycle, a packet of charge is transferred from the region be­ neath the signal electrode (37) to the region beneath the  electrode (26).
