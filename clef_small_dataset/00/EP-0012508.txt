<ABSTRACT>
heat exchangers and other equipment whose surfaces  have become fouled with sludge deposits during the use  of the equipment in the removal of carbon monoxide, lower  olefins or other complexible ligands from gas streams,  employing a liquid sorbent which comprises a cuprous  aluminium tetrahalide and an aromatic hydrocarbon solÂ­ vent, are cleaned by contacting the fouled surfaces of the  equipment with an aqueous ammonium chloride solution  to dissolve and/or lossen substantially all of the deposited  sludge, washing the surfaces with water to remove loosened  sludge and residual cleaning solution, and drying them.
