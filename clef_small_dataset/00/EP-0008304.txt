<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed an improved process for selectively  hydrogenating cyclopentadiene to form cyclopentene in the  presence of a catalyst comprising (a) a hydrocarbonsoluble  nickel compound such as nickel salts of carboxylic acids or  organo nickel compounds, (b) an organo reducing agent such  as organoaluminium compounds or lithium alkyl compounds and  (c) pyridine, the improvement being that the soluble nickel  compound and the pyridine are employed in amounts wherein  the mole ratio of aluminium or lithium to the nickel ranges from  7/1 to 11/1 and the mole ratio of the pyridine to the nickel  compound ranges from 1/1 to 2. 5/1.
