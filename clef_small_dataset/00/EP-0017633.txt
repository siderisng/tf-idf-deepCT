<ABSTRACT>
in freezers with cooled surfaces frost is successively  formed, which impairs the freezing capacity.  therefore to  remove the frost a heating element (24) in a means (19) under  and close to a cooled surface (13) is used.  at first the frost on  this surface (13) melts and the water formed is collected in the  means (19).  the water is vapourized and the vapour is spread  all over the freezing chamber in which it delivers heat to frosty  places.  water formed during the defrosting time is collected  on the bottom of the freezing chamber (17) and is drained to a  vessel (38) by a drain conduit (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention will be described below with reference to an embodiment of a freezer shown in the drawings. fig. 1 is a front view of the cabinet without door, fig. 2 is a vertical cross section of the same cabinet on the line ii - ii of fig. 1, fig. 3 is top view of a vessel placed in the cabinet, and fig. 4 is a vertical cross section of the vessel on the line iv - iv of fig. 3. figs. 1 and 2 show a freezer cabinet 10 operated by a compressor 11 and having cooled shelves 12, 13, 14 and a cooling element 15 inside the freezing chamber 17 under the top wall 16 of the cabinet. the cabinet has a door 18, which however is not shown in fig. 1. a shallow vessel 19 is placed under a shelf 13. the vessel is shown to an enlarged scale in figs. 3 and 4 and will be described below. in the bottom 20 of the cabinet is provided a drain conduit 21 whose upper opening is covered by a removable plug, not shown, preventing air from flowing through the conduit when the cabinet is in operation. under the door the cabinet has a vent louvre 22 to an air channel, through which cooling air is supplied to the compressor 11 and to a condenser 23 at the rear side of the cabinet. the surface of the vessel 19 covers almost the entire cross sectional area of the freezing chamber. a heating element 24 in the form of an electric heating coil is heat-conductively connected to the bottom of the vessel and is fed with current through wires 25, 26 from a control means 27, which as shown in fig. 1 can be placed under the door 18. this means may be placed in the freezing chamber or somewhere else together with control means for the normal operation of the freezer. the means 27 is fed with current through wires 28 from an electric mains and includes a switch with two contacts 29, 30, one switch 30 being disposed on an arm 31 arranged to snap between two positions. the arm is shown in fig. 3 with the switch in its off-position. the switch can be caused to close the circuit by depressing a push button 32. then a lamp 33 lights and indicates that the heating element 24 is active. the control means 27 also includes a thermostat 34 which disconnects the switch. the thermostat 34 has a sensor 35 in heat-conductive- contact with the vessel 19 and an impulse conduit 36 therefrom to the control means 27. linen vapour is being formed'the temperature of the vessel is abt. 100 c nearest the element and lower at a distance from it. thitnen the supply of water ceases, the temperature of the vessel increases rapidly which is used for interruption of the defrosting by the thermostat whose sensor reacts on a temperature which is above the operation temperature
