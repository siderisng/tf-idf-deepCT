a one piece frame for carrying a platform (22) made from  a unitary channel adapted to releasably receive a plurality of  support legs (26).  adjustable top brackets (54) mountable in  the channel (24) for supporting the platform (22) connect to  the frame to affix thereto.  bracing members on the frame (24) prevent lateral shift­ ing of the support legs (26).  the channel (24) at the leg is  notched or recessed to permit a clamp (88) to engage stan­ dard and substandard legs (26) commonly made from two  (2)-foot-by-four (4)-foot wood.  also, the clamps (88) are pro­ vided with a plurality of teeth (98) angularly disposed to engage  the adjacent leg (26) substantially perpendicular.
