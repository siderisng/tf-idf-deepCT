<ABSTRACT>
to facilitate the automation of the entire process of the  production of wiring looms, including the setting up of the  loom board prior to the production of a particular batch the  present invention provides a loom board base (1) adapted to  receive and releasably hold a pluraliry of guide pins (23).  the  base includes a table (2) comprising an upper and lower paral­ lel wire mesh sheet frames (10, 11).  a pair of actuators (14) are  actuable to separate these frames to release pins previously  held on the table with shaft portions thereof projecting  through the upper frame and terminating in pointed end por­ tions (25) held by layers, of resilient material (21, 22) of the  lower frame (11).  the table (2) is rotatably mounted on a frame  (3) for inversion to permit the released pins to fall under  gravity from the table.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for use in the production of wiring looms this invention relates to apparatus for use in the production of wiring loons, and more particularly to a loom board base having a construction to facilitate the releasable attachment of guide pins. a wiring loom is an assembly of wires bound or otherwise held together as a bundle, for providing the required electrical connection between various electrical components in a piece of equipment. one particular field in which they are extensively used is in the manufacture of domestic and industrial powered vehicles, such as automobiles, lorries, industrial trucks, which include a large number of such electrical components. the loom or looms are commonly disposed in channels, or are otherwise fixed to the frame of the vehicle, the wires, individually indentified by means of colour coding extending between swztches###wer source,¯ lighting equipment, engine or motor components, fuses, steering gear, etc. it will be appreciated that the different components and relative disposition thereof in different vehicles requires that such looms be specially designed for the particular vehicle concerned. the construction of the looms involves the laying of wire lengths along predetermined paths marked on a board, and defined by a multiplicity of pins held in and projecting from the board and serving to hold the wires in place until all of the wires are laid. the wires, of which the ends are, or at some stage in the process have been appropriately terminated, are then taped, dipped or otherwise temporarily held together, and the loom removed from the board and subsequently braided to provide a more permanent binding. hitherto, where the loom board has been of a somewhat permanent construction including a plywood base with hammered-in pins, it has been necessary to retain a stock of boards, one for each type of loom to be produced. it is now envisaged that the manual operation of wire cutting, terminating, laying and binding be performed automatically by a pre-programmed manipulator, and in order to avoid the necessity to provide enrage space for a stock of boards, and to maximise the advantages afforded by the use of such a manipulator, it is proposed that the production of a batch of wiring looms shall include the initial step of setting out of pins for any required loom on a universal loom board by the manipulator, rather than the selection of the board from the aforesaid stock. it is the object of this invention to provide a base constructed so as to facilitate such setting out of the loom board by the manipulator. according to the present invention there is provided a loom board base for receiving and releasably holding a plurality of guide pins in position to project on one side of the board at predetermined points thereon, the base including a table comprising a pair of superposed parallel sheets of which at least one is provided with an array of apertures through which, in use, end portions of said pins can pass, and of which the

claims:    1. a loom board base for receiving and releasably holding a plurality of guide pins in position   to project    on one side of the board at predetermined points thereon, the base including a table comprising a pair of superposed parallel sheets of which at least one is provided with an array of apertures through which, in use, end portions of said pins can pass, and of which the other is adapted to receive and inhibit lateral movement of the ends of the pins, thereby to hold each said pin in position as aforesaid, actuator means being provided to effect relative   separationqf    said sheets in a direction normal to the sheets thereby, when in use, to release the ends of the pins from the said other sheet to permit removal of the pins from the table.    2. a base according to claim 1 including mean#s for inverting the table from a working position in which the said one sheet is uppermost to an inverted position in which said other sheet is uppermost, to allow the pins, when in use, to fall under gravity from the table upon separation, in said inverted position of the sheets.    3. a base according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said one sheet is a mesh work screen and is carried on a peripheral framework.      4. a base according to claim 3 wherein said other sheet includes a meshwork layer facing said one sheet and is also carried on a peripheral framework, said actuator means being connected to said frameworks to effect relative displacement thereof.    5. a base according to claim 4 wherein said other sheet further includes a first layer of penetrable resilient material adjacent said meshwork layer, a relatively rigid board, and a second layer of foamed material between said backing board and said first layer.    6. a base according to claim 5 wherein said first layer is made of polyurethane rubber, and said second layer is made of a relatively   dense    synthetic foam.    7. a base according to any of claims 4 to 6 wherein the table includes a peripheral support frame enclosing the said frameworks of which one is fixed relative to the support frame, and of which the other is coupled to be displaced by one or more linear actuators constituting said actuator means and mounted on said support frame.    8. an assemblage comprising a loom board base according to any preceding claim and a plurality of pins, each having a first portion which can, in use, pass through an aperture of said one sheet, and which terminates at an end of the pin tapered to form a point to facilitate penetration of the sheets, and further having a second portion which cannot pass through the aperture thereby to  limit the extent to which the pin may penetrate the table.     9. an assemblage according to claim 8 wherein each pin is double-ended as hereinbefore defined, said second portion comprising a length extending symmetrically from the centre of the pin toward both ends.    10. apparatus for use in the production of wiring looms including a loom board or an assemblage according to any preceding claim and means, including an automatic manipulator, for assembling wiring looms on the board by laying lengths of wire on said table along predetermined paths to be defined by said guide pins after application of appropriate terminals to the ends of the wires, and by applying to said wires means to hold said wires together to constitute the assembled wiring loom
