<ABSTRACT>
chlorinated polyvinyl chloride resin (cpvc) is blended  with a block copolymer of styrene and a diene (sd) or of  styrene-diene-styrene (sds), which block copolymer is referred  to as a "pro-modifier" because, by itself, it performs a  dual function of processing aid and impact modifier in cpvc.   for tailoring specific desirable impact properties and physical  characteristics into a cpvc resin composition, it may be  desirable to use a conventional impact modifier in combination  with the block copolymer.  when the block copolymer is  used, such use being referred to as that of a "co-modifier",  the block copolymer and conventional impact modifier  provide a cpvc composition with unexpectedly enhanced  impact strength.  the block copolymer consists essentially of  a vinyl aromatic compound and a conjugated diene such as  styrene-diene (sd) diblock copolymer, or a styrene-diene-styrene  (sds) polyblock copolymer having a linear or radial  block structure, or mixtures of linear and radial block  copolymers.  when a conventional impact modifier is used, it  may be any elastomer additive, preferably a nucleated  rubbery graft copolymer, but a minor quantity by weight of a  synthetic resinous interpolymer which contains no rubber  polymer, may also be used.
