<ABSTRACT>
method of, and apparatus for, making electrical harnesses.  for making an electrical harness comprising an electrical  connector to each of a plurality of terminals of which  an individual insulated wire is connected, wires (202) are  fed through a wire stripping station (6) with its stripper  ram (50) raised, to a wire connecting station (4), with wire  lengthening blades (14) and wire stuffers (8) also raised.   the wire stuffers (8) are first lowered to connect the wires  (202) to terminals in a connector (200) at the connecting  station (4), the lengthening blades (14) are then lowered  to form loops in the wires (202) to lengthen them differentially,  the ram (50) is then lowered to sever the wires (202),  and the insulation thereof back from the ends of the wires.   the blades (14) are finally further lowered to cause the  severed ends (204) of the wires (202) to be stripped of  insulation.
