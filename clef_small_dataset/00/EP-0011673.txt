<DESCRIPTION>
improved machiix; for lgading coke ovens the present invention relates to an improved machine for loading coke ovens. more specifically, the invention relates to an improved apparatus effective to carry out the loading of coke ovens by finely subdivided sea coal having a moisture contents up to 15%, under extremely safe conditions with respect to the enviromental protection. as it is known, in the industrial systems, the coke ovens are arranged according to parallel rows and for loading said ovens sea coal loading apparatuses are used substantially consisting of a series of hoppers, in number corresponding to the oven mouth number, as mounted on a rail movable carriage. said hoppers are aligned with respect to the individual oven loading mouths, and upon removing, either automatically or not, the individual plus element from the oven mouths and having lowered a lug, each hopper being provided with, in order to form a continuous path between the hopper and oven, the coal is directly discharged by gravity or any suitable systems, into the inside of the oven at a very high speed and in a continuous even manner. the main drawbacks involved in the coke oven loading operations by the known loading apparatuses, consist of the high atmospheric pollution and bad working conditions due to the releasing of gases and powders during said operations in fact the coal, which is quickly introduced in the heated oven, causes a displacement of an equivalent heated air volume from the oven, which air, upon exiting, also entrains a some amount of coal powder. furthermore, the introduced coal, upon contacting the heated oven walls, immediately releases a great amount of gases exiting from the loading mouths and evolving columns thereby entraining a further amount of coal powder. several methods have been studied and tested in order to eliminate or at least reduce this gas and powder emission, during the oven loading operation, but none of said methods has been able of providing satisfactory results. thus, for example, a method has been tested consisting of creating a certain tightness between the loading hopper and oven introducing mouths, sucking, by means of sucking devices and through provided ducts nearly the complete amount of gases evolved from the chamber, burning said gases and finally settling, by means of a nebulized water yet, the fumes and ashes originated by said burning step. this method, however, has the drawback that, under determined conditions, the so-called fire-dumping gas forms which, by exploding may damage the system and, in any way, constitutes a danger for the loading operators. moreover, the treating by water causes acid liquid suspensions to form because of the presence of sulphur dioxide in the discharging fumes; these aqueous acid suspensions corrode the system structures they inevitably contact. another known method which has had a certain practical interest, consists of using loading apparatuses with a tight closure of the loading mouths and extracting gases and powders directly from the barrel, by means of sucking. this sucking is obtained by super-heated steam
