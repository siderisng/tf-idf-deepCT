<ABSTRACT>
a process for polymerising ethylene or mixtures thereof  with up to 40 weight percent of other 1-olefinic material by  contacting the monomer under particle form conditions at a  temperature not greater than 112°c with a catalyst which is  the product of heat activating chromium trioxide or a com­ pound calcinable thereto supported on a refractory oxide and  a catalyst modifier which is a trihydrocarbyl aluminium and  an aliphatic acyclic conlugated diene.  the particle form  polymerisation process is preferably carried out in a liquid  paraffinic hydrocarbon.  the chromium compound is prefer­ ably supported on silica, alumina, zirconia, thoria, or silica-­ alumina.  the activation is preferably carried out at 400 to  900°c the trihydrocarbyl aluminium is preferably an  aluminum alkyl wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to 10  carbon atoms.  the diene can be for example butadiene or  isoprene
