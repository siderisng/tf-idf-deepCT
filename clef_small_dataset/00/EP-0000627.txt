<ABSTRACT>
carriers for containers, apparatus and method for applying  the same to containers, such as bottles (b), and made from  such material as paper board formed to operate as levers able  to withstand tension and compression and arranged as a  four-sided tube either singly or with another alongside it and  connected.  openings (10 and 14) in the top and bottom of the  tube to admit each container, at least one side wall (4a, 4b or  6a, 6b) deformable inwardly along a line to grip each container  and such side wall above and below the line of deformation  stressed compressively.  the joint (15) forming the paperboard into a tube utilises  the compressive force and the stiffness locked into such side  walls and which form the ends of the blank, by arranging them  as force components at an angle and in opposition one to the  other and their resultant force resisted, by a relatively immovable  and receptive part of the carrier with containers holding  the confluence of the side walls captive, thereby making the  ends of the blank secure in a radial plain.  the ends of the blank  are further secured axially by providing the ends of both such  side walls with interlocking tongue extensions (21 and 22) so  that an effective joint is made in total.
