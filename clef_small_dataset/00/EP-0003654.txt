<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a lift truck (12) having a mast  assembly (10) for lifting a load.  the assembly includes a  first fixed pair of spaced-apart uprights (14, 16) and a  second movable pair of spaced-apart uprights (38, 40)  with the second pair nested for vertical translation within  the first pair, and a carriage (72) coupled to the second  pair for vertical translation in relation to the second pair.   two chains (102, 104), which extend over two sheaves (97,  98) connected to a cross-member (61) fixed to the upper  ends of the second pair of uprights (38, 40), have one end  connected to a first hydraulic cylinder and piston (90, 92)  and their other end to the carriage (72).  second and third  hydraulic cylinders (120, 141) behind the first and second  pair of uprights (14, 16) are coupled to respective third  and fourth sheaves (130, 150) about which extend additional  chains (134, 154) having one end connected to the  fixed uprights (14, 16) and the other end connected to the  movable uprights (38, 40).  the first hydraulic cylinder and  piston (90, 92) lifts the carriage (72) in relation to all the  uprights and the second and third hydraulic cylinders (120,  141) simultaneously raise the second pair of uprights (38,  40) and the carriage (72) relative to the first uprights (14,  16).  the second and third hydraulic cylinders (120, 141)  are anchored on a cross-brace (114), intermediate the ends  of the uprights (14, 16), which is acted on by a fourth hydraulic  cylinder and piston (160, 162) to tilt the assembly  (10).
