<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method of treating sludge  liquors to remove and recover therefrom in usable form  ammonia, the method comprising removing coâ‚‚ from the  liquor to raise its ph initially, then raising the ph to a value of  at least 9 (2), purifying the liquor (3, 4), heating it (15),  stripping the ammonia from the liquor with air in one tower  (9), passing the air in co-current relation with an acid in  another tower to form a usable ammonia salt, and recycling  (24) the air through the towers in a continuous cycle.
