<ABSTRACT>
a fluid dispenser comprising a resiliently deformable  reservoir (1), dosing means which comprise a hollow  chamber (5) integral with and above the reservoir and hav­ ing an outlet (9) through which fluid may be dispensed and  a tube (4) integral with the reservoir and providing com­ munication between reservoir and dosing means, the posi­ tion of the tube relative to the outlet being such that fluid  cannot flow between the reservoir and hollow chamber  whilst fluid is dispensed from the dosing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
integral dispenser the present invention relates to fluid dispensers for dispensing fluids in the forni of liquids or powders in measured doses. such devices are particularly suitable for the application of liquid or powdered medicaments to animals but may equally well be. used whenever unit doses of fluids are to be dispensed,for example food or drink concentrates, detergents, fluid chemicals, weed killers and substances for plant treatment such as hormones or insecticides. for application to animas the main use 15 for dispensing insecticides or anthelmintics on to the bacls of animals such as cattle or sheep. many medicaments are absorbed through the skin on dermal application and the ability to be able to accurately dose large numbers of animals rapidly and under varying conditions is important. one method of dispensing such fluids is simply to pour the fluid from a reservoir such as a bottle into a separate measuring device, for example a measuring cylinder or cup of known capacity, and hence from there to the desired location. however, this method requires the availability of a separate measuring device which not only may become lost damaged or contaminated withother fluids dirt or the like but also introduces the possibility of spillage of expensive and/or harmful liquids at each time or dispensing thereby resulting in economic loss or harm to tjne operator. another method of dispensing fluids comprises a reservoir into which is introduced a separate dosing device through which the fluid is measured and dispensed for example as described in our copending application no. 4931/76. it is an object of tliis invention to provide a fluid dispensing device which can be used easily to both stole the fluid and repeatedly provide a reasonably accurate dose of a fluid for subsequent application tien required. the present invention accordingly provides a fluid dispenser comprising a resiliently deform able reservoir, dosing means which comprise a iiollow chamber integral with and above the reservoir and having an outlet through which the fluid may be dispensed and a tube integral with the resevoir and providing communication between the reservoir and dosing means, the relative positions of the outlet and the tube being such that no fluid flows between the reservoir and dosing means whilst fluid is dispensed from the dosing means. one means of preventing the flow of liquid between reservoir and dosing means during dispens- ing is to position the outlet such that the tube remains above the adjacent part of the reservoir whilst the fluid is dispensed from the dosing means. the dispensing device provides in a single unit both reservoir ani dosing means and is readily operated by compression of the reservoir to fill the dosing means to tlie required level and then by pouring the fluid from the dosing means to the desired location. the dispenser is conveniently suitable to be transported and operated by hand. the dispensing device described may conveniently be prepared in a single' operation by conventional means for example by blow-moulding, at little additional expense to production
