<ABSTRACT>
a process is provided for regenerating a spent electro­ less copper plating bath which contains alkali metal salts re­ sulting from the reduction of a water soluble copper salt under  copper plating and reducing conditions.  the regeneration is ef­ fected by means of the electrodialytic transfer of at least a por­ tion of the anions in the spent plating bath through an anionic  permselective membrane (18) into the anode compartment  (12) of an electrodialytic cell (10).  in the preferred embodi­ ment, hydroxyl ions from the cathode compartment (16) of the  electrodialytic cell (10) are concurrently transferred through a  second anionic permselective membrane (20) to replace the  transferred anions, the replacement taking place in a compart­ ment (14) of the electrodialytic cell (10) located between the  two anionic permselective membranes (18, 20).  e. g. , the spent  solution to be regenerated is an aqueous solution containing  cu⁺⁺, na⁺, oh⁻, hcoo⁻, so₄⁻⁻, hcho and the sodium salt  of edta.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the red 10n of roless plating baes this invention relates to a process for the regeneration of electroless copper plating baths. electroless metal plating baths that are used commercially generally contain a water soluble salt of the metal to be deposited on the selected substrate and a reducing agent in an aqueous alkaline solution. a complexing or chelating agent is commonly present to prevent precipitation of metal hydroxide. the reducing agent generally is more effective at high pr values, and large amounts of alkali metal hydroxide are consumed in the reduction of the metal salt. when formaldehyde is used as the reducing agent substantially larger amounts of alkali metal hydroxide are consumed because of disproportionation of formaldehyde with hydroxide into formate. the reaction products of the reduction reaction are alkali metal salts, such as sodium formate and sodium sulfate. a build up of these reaction products within a copper plating bath, for example, causes cuprous oxide to form spontaneously within the plating bath leading to general bath decomposition. also during the plating process ub tan- tial amounts of alkali metal hydroxide are consumed since four moles of alkali metal hydroxide are required for each mole of copper deposited. thus the p" of the plating bath rapidly drops, causing loss of effective plating, i.e., metal deposition, unless the alkali metal hydroxide is replenished. it would be desirable to selectively remove at least a portion of the reaction product anions and also increase the pe of the plating bath whereby only a solution of the metal salt and reducing agent, together with a small amount of the chelating or complexing agent, if needed, is added to the regenerated plating bath to provide a plating bath again suitable for electroless plating. in accordance with the present invention, in its broadest aspects, a process is provided for removing at least a portion of the anionic reaction products from a spent electroless copper plating bath by withdrawing the undesired anions through an anionic permselective membrane. in the preferred embodiment the spent plating bath from an electroless copper plating bath is regenerated in a regeneration zone or centre compartment of an electrodialytic cell positioned between an anolyte compartment and a catholyte compartment. two anionic perm- selective membranes separate the respective compartments and permit the selective passage or migration of anions therethrough, to the substantial exclusion of cations. the catholyte compartment contains a source of hydroxyl anions in aqueous solution generally an alkali metal hydroxide, while the anolyte compartment contaiz an aqueous solution, either alkaline or acidic. the solution in the anolyte compartment is selected to receive the anionic reaction products or by-products of the reduction reaction that occurs during the electroless plating. the electrodialytic cell is arranged during operation to effect the migration of hydroxyl ions from the catholyte zone through the anionic membrane to the regeneration zone or centre compartment, and also to effect concurrently the migration of the anions of the reaction product salts from the regeneration zone through the anionic membrane
