<ABSTRACT>
plastics material metallized with a magnetically suscept­ able material, e. g chrome plated abs, which has been com­ minuted (1, 2) and optionally subjected to a preliminary  magnetic separation (3) to remove magnetisable particles, is  cooled (5) to below the glass transition temperature of the  plastics material end impacted (6) to form a powder disper­ sion of metal and plastics material.  metal particles are with­ drawn from the dispersion by magnetic separation (7, 9)  which is preferably carried in two stages, the product of the  first stage being graded (8) and the final stage (9) being carried  out on tne smaller particle size fraction.  the resulting plastics  material can be used directly or filtered by extrusion through a  screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
description this invention relates to a method and apparatus for the sep-atian of plastics and metal from mttallized plastics. reclamation of materials from spent or otherwise normally discarded articles has obvious potential for financial as well as environmental benefit. reclamation of plastic or metal from articles consisting of vital or plastic alone may not require a specialized approach. on the other hand, reclamation of metal, plastic or both from articles comprising intimately combined metal and plastic presents liberation and separation considerations. several approaches have been proposed. see, for example, u.s. patents 4,025,990; 4,020,992; 3,995,816; 3,990,641; 3,718,2d4; 3,666,185; 3,643,873; 3,527,414; 2,879,035; and 1,978,204. generally, however, recovery of metallized plastic, such as chrome plated plastic, has not received, as far as know, particular attention. for example, the above patents typically provide recovery processes for scrap or other normally discarded articles in which there is "embedded or occluded" metal (e.g. u.s. patent 2,879,005), or in which the metal is not expected to tenaciously adhere to the plastic (e.g. u.s. patent 4,020,992 relates to bottle caps). (see, also, u patents 1,978,204; 3,718,284; 3,995,816; and 4,025,990 which show tire recovery; and u.s. patents 3,527,414 and 3,990,6w1 which show wire recovery). moreover, in other instances focus is primarily on recovery of metal, e.g. u.s. patents 3,885,744 and 3,443,873. reclamation of plastic from metallized plastic presents especially difficult liberation aa well as separation problems. for example, metallized plastic is designed to resist breaking away of mttal from plastic. to this end, prior to detallization such as plating, the plastic may be etched, abraded or otherwise treated to adhere tenaciously metal to plastic. even after liberation of netal from plastic, however, separation can be further complicated by additional aspects of certain metallized plastic. for example, the metal may coniprise non-ferrous or essentially non-ferrous metal and even contain non- or substantially non-ferromagnetic metal (veg. copperj layers. still further, even low levels of minute particles can render reclaimed plastic unacceptable for return to higher uses, e.g., plating grade thermoplastic. still other difficulties (e.g. handling of dust generation) that have been overcome in provision of the industrially suitable and economicalìy valuable process of this invention will be more apparent from the following disclosure. according to the present invention, there is provided a method for separation of netal and plastics from metallized plastics material comprising a plastics having a tenaciously adherent metal costing which is magnetically susceptable, which method comprises: : a. erposing pieces of said metallized plastics material to a temperature sufficiently below the glass transi tion temperature of said plastic to maintain its brittleness daring milling; b, impacting the cooled pieces to shatter them, pulverize substantially all of said plastic into a powder and form a plastics and metal dispersion having at least substantially metal particles therein; c. withdrawing from said dispersion a sufficient amount of said metal to provide a reusable plastics material, said withdrawal comprising exposing at least a portion of said dispersion to one or more magnetic separations. the invention also includes an apparatus for continuous reclamation
