<ABSTRACT>
a helically fabricated flexible hose having two reinforcing  wires (100, 110) which also serve as electrical conductors  and a multiple-ply wall which is thicker over the wire  convolutions than between them and is reinforced with  cords (150, 160, 170, 180, 190) within the wall plies, is produced  by means of a continuously advancing definite length  mandrel device wherein a cylindrical mandrel surface is  formed by helically wound closedloop belt convolutions  (30a, 30b).  a plurality of belts are employed to form the  mandrel surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
helically fabricated flexible hose and mandrel device for producing the same the invention refers to a helically fabricated flexible hose and a mandrel device for producing the same. it has long been recognized that wire reinforced flexible hose can be modified so that the helical wire serves as an electrical conductor as well as a structural member. this is particularly useful in vacuum cleaner devices where an electrically operated component such as a brush at the remote end of the hose receives its power through the hose wall rather than through a separate conductor. see for example united states patent no. 2,890,264. more recently, a design of such a hose has been proposed with two parallel helical wires, each insulated with plastic, and with a single ply wall of flexible plastic disposed about the wire convolutions. such a double lead structure is shown in united states patents nos. 3,636,285 and 3,928,715. hose of this form is typically somewhat stiff and has less than satisfactory abrasive resitance, particularly on the raised convolutions over the wires. a certain degree of added strength is provided in another form of prior art hose where a side-by-side pair of insulated helical wires are covered by two uniformly thick plastic wall plies with helical and longitudinal reinforcing cords between the plies. this is a single lead, rather than a double lead, structure and hence the total amount of wire is quite large, resulting not only in added weight but in increase voltage drop as well. the double-wire single lead hose referred to has been manufactured on a continuously advancing definite length mandrel device as shown in untited states patent no. 3,155,559, in which a continuously-advancing definitelength mandrel comprising a frame and a substantially tubular mandrel core axially rotatable with respect to the frame is disclosed. a belt is provided with a portion thereof wrapped helically about the core with its convolutions defining a mandrel surface. drive means are included for rotating the core with respect to the frame and drawing additional convolutions of the belt about one end of the core. feeding means are included on the frame for urging all of the convolutions toward the opposite end of the core. a belt guide is provided at the opposite end of the core and affixed to the frame for controlling the collapse of each successive belt convolution and directing it inwardly through the core so that it can be wrapped back onto the core it was recognized from the outset that the helically fabricated tubing made on such a mandrel would have a helical lead or pitch equal to the lead or pitch of the single belt. therefore it was suggested in the prior art patent itself that two or more belts could be wrapped around the core and passed around a multiple groove device so that the mandrel surface would advance further at each revolution of the core (see lines 1 to 9 of column 5 of united states patent no. 3,155,559). it is the
