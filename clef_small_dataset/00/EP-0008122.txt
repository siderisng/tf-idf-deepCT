<ABSTRACT>
For copying diapositifies, retaining frames are used, which cover for themselves or together with the frames of inserted, framed diapositifies area areas greater than that of the diapositives.Here, a first holding frame, which is charged with a first set of framed diapositives, is arranged over a sheet of coal material, and a first exposure is performed.The first retaining frame is then removed, and a second holding frame loaded with a second set of framed diapositives is arranged over the same sheet in such a layer that the inserted th divositives are above the area ranges which have previously been covered by the first retaining frameare.A second exposure is performed here.
