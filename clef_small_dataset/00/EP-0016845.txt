<ABSTRACT>
substrates of xanthine oxidase such as xanthine, hypox­ anthine, guanine, 2-hydroxypyrine, etc. , are easily measured by  subjecting then to microorganism-originating xanthine oxi­ dase, and then measuring the produced hydrogen peroxide  using a hydrogen peroxide-measuring system comprising pe­ roxidase and a color-forming agent.  this analysis is conducted  in one stage by using an analysis composition comprising the  xanthine oxidase and the hydrogen peroxide-measuring sys­ tem.  this method can be applied to measuring a material parti­ cipating in a system of quantitatively producing the substrate  as a result of reaction or decomposition.  where the system in­ volves enzymatic reaction, the material can also be measured  in one stage.  xanthine oxidase to be used for this purpose is  different from known ones in molecular weight, etc. , and can  be yielded by cultivating microorganism of enterobacter ge­ nus.

<DESCRIPTION>
description title of the invention method and test composition for the determination of the substrate for xanthine oxidase technical field] the present invention relates to a method for the determination of the substrate for xanthine oxidase in a sample using xanthine oxidase derived from a microorganism and a test composition suitable therefor. the present invention also pertains to a method for the determination of a reactant in the reaction system wherein the substrate for xanthine oxidase is quantitatively formed by the reaction or decomposition and the determination of the activity of enzyme which catalyzes the reaction in the system, and a test composition used therefor. the present invention further pertains to a novel xanthine oxidase suitable for the determination described above and a process for producing the enzyme using a microorganism. [background art] it is known that xanthine oxidase (ec 1.2.3.2) catalyzes the oxidation of the substrate thereof such as hypoxanthine to form uric acid and hydrogen peroxide and that the enzyme exists in milk. the enzyme derived from milk is available. the determination of the substrate for an oxidase by oxidizing the substrate by the action of the oxidase and determining the amount of reaction product stoichiometrically formed is generally conducted. for example, it has been known that hypoxanthine is oxidized by the action of xanthine oxidase to form uric acid and hydrogen peroxide. therefore, it is easily understood that the determination of the substrate can be performed by determining the amount of formed uric acid or hydrogen peroxide when the substrate is determined from the amount of a product obtained by oxidizing the substrate by the action of oxidase, the determination is generally carried out by reacting the formed hydrogen peroxide with a coloring reagent and determining the amount of the formed hydrogen peroxide by measuring the absorbancy of the reaction solution in visible ray region. when the substrate is oxidized by the action of xanthine oxidase derived from milk and the formed hydrogen peroxide is introduced into a pigment system, the formed pigment is unstable and is decomposed in a- brief period of time. therefore, the substrate cannot be determined by the change in absorbancy in visible ray region. accordingly, the substrate is generally determined by the change in absorbancy in ultraviolet region based on the formation of uric acid without the determination of hydrogen peroxide. after studying the process for producing a xantine oxidase by fermentation, the present inventors have found that xanthine oxidase is produced by culturing a microorganism belonging to the genus enterobacter and capable of producing xanthine oxidase in a nutrient medium. it has been found that when the substrate is oxidized by the action of xanthine oxidase derived from microorganism and the formed hydrogen peroxide is introduced into a pigment system, the formed pigment is stable and the substrate in a sample can bedetermined by measuring the absorbancy in visible ray region based on the pigment. it has been known that the enzyme derived from microorganism belonging to the genus pseudomonas, escherichia,
