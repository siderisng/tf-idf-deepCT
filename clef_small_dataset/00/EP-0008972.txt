<ABSTRACT>
The cutting plate for radiated machining is disk arranged (1) having two opposite cone holes (3, 4) with a common base (C) forming the median plane whose longitudinal axis (XX ') is alignment with theAxis of rotation of the tool holder (2) and passes through the center (P) of the circle (C) of the base.each trunk of cone (3.4) has a cutting face (F, F ') in the median plane disposed symmetrically on either side of the longitudinal median axis (XX'), obtained by a depth notch inThe respective cone trunk chopped along the median plane and limited by an inclined plane so that the two cutting faces (F, F ') pass into a common point (H) located on the longitudinal median axis (XX') And forming with said inclined planes of the cords (HI, HI') of the basic circle (C) which leave said common point (H) and form an acute angle (β).Application to milling machines to reproduce.
