<ABSTRACT>
an improved disposable diaper of the type having a  relatively high elongation to tensile force property, an ab足 sorbent pad (60), and tape-tab fasteners (31, 32) coated  with a peelable adhesive.  the backsheet (21) is reinforced  by coating the mother's bond region thereof with a mate足 rial having high tensile strength and a low elongation to  tensile force property relative to the backsheet material.   the coating may be continuous or patterned and may be  disposed on either the outwardly facing surface or the in足 wardly facing surface of the mother's bond region of the  backsheet.  when applied to the inwardly facing surface,  the coating material may be adhesive material and may se足 cure the backsheet to the pad assembly of the diaper.  the  reinforcement of the backsheet improves the resistance of  the backsheet to stretching and tearing when subjected to  tensile forces during fastening and wearing, and to peeling  forces when the tape-tab fasteners are being peeled open.   thus, the fasteners are refastenable.
