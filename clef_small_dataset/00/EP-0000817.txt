<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method for disentangling workpieces  is disclosed.  the apparatus comprises a container (1) into which the  entangled workpieces are placed, a seried of air jets (55)  located in the base of the container, and an outlet assembly (7)  consisting of a pair of overlapping relatively slidable comb-shaped  plates (8,9) defining a series of slots (7′) of adjustable  width.  previous disentanglers have utilised tubular outlet  means which have often been connected to long dispensing  tubes.  problems with such previous devices are that the feed  rate is restricted by the cross-sectional area of the outlet tubes  and that the workpieces can become entangled in the outlet  means.  the use of slots (7′) brings about a substantial  improvement.  an electropneumatic circuit is disclosed which  periodically widens the slots to release any trapped workpieces.   a circulatory flow (c) of the workpieces is produced in  the container and the disentangling is brought about primarily  by the brushing action of the workpieces against the slots.
