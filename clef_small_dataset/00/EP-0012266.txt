<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for changing tuyere and tuyere stock assem­ blies of a blast furnace in accordance with one aspect of the  invention includes support rail means extending around the  furnace and fixed a selected distance above the level of the  tuyeres of the furnace.  a main support carriage (36) is ar­ ranged for travel along said rail means and first motor means  are provided for effecting such travel.  a guide frame (38) is  connected to the main support carriage (36) and depends  downwardly therefrom.  the guide frame (38) is connected for rotation about a  vertical axis relative to the main support carriage (36).  a sec­ ond motor means is provided for effecting this relative rota­ tion about the vertical axis.  a carriage support frame (40) is  associated with the guide frame (38) and is adapted to travel  upwardly and downwardly along the latter in a vertical path.   third motor means (114) are connected between the carriage  support frame (40) and the main support carriage (36) to ef­ fect the upward and downward movement of the carriage  support frame (40).  the carriage support frame (40) includes  an elongated horizontal section defining a path of travel for a  tuyere stock support carriage (44).  a tuyere stock support  carriage (44) is disposed on the carriage support frame (40)  for travel along the horizontal section (42) thereof at a level  corresponding generally to the level of the tuyeres.  fourth  motor means (120) are provided for effecting movement of  the tuyere stock-support carriage (44) along the horizontal  section (42) of the support frame (40).  the tuyere stock sup­ port carriage (44) has clamp means (46) thereon for engaging  and holding a tuyere stock.  by selection actuation of the above-noted first, second,  third and fourth motor (120) means, the tuyere stock support  carriage (44) may be brought into close juxtaposition and  alignment with a tuyere stock and the clamp means (46) en­ gaged therewith and the tuyere assembly either retracted  from or inserted into the blast furnace in a prescribed man­ ner.
