<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus dor dewatering water-containing substances, in particular sludge obtained in sewage treatment plants, wherein the preferably already dewatered material is passed between continuously moving water-permeable belts or screen belts (19, 24) through a gap (23) defined by said belts or screen belts, the screen belts (19, 24) or the like being supported in direction to the gap (23) by endless plate chains (21, 25) revolving around deflection and drive sprockets (28, 29), which endless plate chains are adjustable in direction to the gap (23), the plate chains (21, 25) being provided along their entire length with rollers (45, 46) which are supported against roller tracks (38), at least one of the roller tracks (38) being arbitrarily adjustable in direction transverse to the gap (23), the roller tracks (38) preferably being rigidly arranged on the frame (31, 32) on which also the deflection and drive sprockets (28 and 29) are supported and at least one of the frames (32) is adjustable in direction transverse to the gap (23), while the other frame (31) can be stationarily arranged, characterized in that the extremity of the roller track (38) or of the adjustable frame (32) facing the intake end of the gap (23) and the extremity of the roller track (38) or of the adjustable frame (32) facing the discharge end of the gap (23) can be adjusted independent of the respective other extremity in direction transverse to the gap, that eccentrics are supported in the area of the two extremities of the frames (31, 32) or of the roller tracks (38), which eccentrics are pivotally mounted on one of the frames (31) each or one one of the roller tracks (39) each and are pivotable by independent hydraulic cylinders and on which eccentrics pull and push rods (60 and 61, resp. ) act which act on the other frame (32) or the other roller track (38), that the pull and push rods (60 and 61, resp. ) act on the respective frame (32) or roller track (38) through the intermediary of springs (65) and that the springs (65) are compression springs housed in spring cups (63) that are rigidly connected to the respective frame (32), that the pull and push rods (60 and 61, resp. ) are passed through a spring collar (67) of the spring cup (63) against which the compression spring (65) is supported, the other end of the compression spring (65) being supported against the opposite cover (64) of the cup (63) and said cover (64) being rigidly connected to the mantle of the cup (63) and supported against a flange (70) connected to the push and pull rod (60 and 61, resp. ).
