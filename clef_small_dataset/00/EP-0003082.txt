<ABSTRACT>
a mould for producing a decorated article comprises a  base part with a mould cavity and a lid part co-operating with  but being movable away from the base part, the surface of  the lid part facing the base part being substantially planar or  part-cylindrical and extending beyond the wall (12).  the wall  (12) preferably has a knife edge (13) to provide a score line  for flashing.  the method of producing the article comprises  the steps of locating in a predetermined position on the lid  part a carrier (15) having ink (18) thereon, charging the base  part with plastics material, locating the lid part in a predetermined  position on the base part so that the carrier (15)  extends beyond the co-operating wall (12) of the base part,  and rotationally moulding the article.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: moulded articles this invention relates to rotationally decorated moulded articles and to a method and a mould for producing such articles. previously, decorated moulded articles have been produced by first moulding the article and printing the decoration thereon. this has proved expensive, particularly if multi-coloured printing is required. in the case of decorated playballs, it is known to insert in the bottom of the mould before moulding a decorated insert of a plastics material which has the desired printing thereon, the material of the insert being compatible with that of the playball. w7hen moulded, the insert is embedded in and fused with the finished playball. however, it is particularly difficult to properly locate and retain the insert in position. an object of the invention is to provide a method b¯rwçhich a decorated article having a high level of quality can be produced relatively inexpensively. the method permits accurate location of the decoration on the article. in accordance vith one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a decorated article using a mould comprising a base part with a mould cavity and a lid part co-operating with but being movable away from the base part, the surface of the lid part facing the base part being substantially planar or part-cylindrical, characterised in that said method comprises the steps of locating in a predetermined position on the lid part a carrier having ink thereon, charging the base part with plastics material, locating the lid part in a predetermined position on the base part so that the carrier extends beyond the co-operating wall of the base part, and rotationally moulding the article. in accordance with another aspect ov the invention there is provided a method according to claim 1, wherein the co-operating wall of the base part hat aknife-edge, characterised in that said method includes the step of removing after moulding the portion of the carrier which extends beyond the co-operating wall of the base part and which has been scored or cut through by the knife edge during moulding. preferably1 the co-operating walls of the base mould part present a knife edge which is engageable with the lid part, the knife edge scoring or cutting through the carrier during moulding to avoid the necessity of pre-cutting the carrier to the shape of the base part of the mould. the knife edge is preferably a thickness less than 1/32 inches (0.794 cm). the carrier can be of any simple staple, for example rectangular, and is preferably located relative to the lid part by suitable locating means, for example projections on the lid part which co-operate with holes in the carrier. the carrier is preferably plastics material which is during the moulding operation fused with the plastics material of the article. the carrier plastics material is preferably transparent and may be above the ink layer in the finished article, in which case it forms a protective layer. it is presently preferred, however, that the carrier plastics material is
