<DESCRIPTION>
enantiomers of triazole' compounds, a process for preparing them, their use as plant fungicides and growth regulating agents and compositions containing them this invention relates to enantiomers of certain triazole derivatives, to a process for obtaining these enantiomers, to fungicidal and plant growth regulating compositions containing them, to a method of combating fungal infections in, regulating the growth of plants using them. british patent application no. 34590/76 which corresponds to dutch patent application no. 77019197 (the disclosure of which applications is incorporated herein by reference)-, discloses inter alia compounds of general formula (i): emi1.1 wherein r1 is benzyl optionally ring substituted with up to three substituents selected from the class consisting of halogen, alkyl and alkoxy, and r2 is c16 alkyl, and their esters, acid addition salts and metal complexes. the compounds are stated to have plant fungicidal and plant growth regulating activities. it will be appreciated that these compounds contain two chiral centres. this means that the compounds can exist in four optical isomeric forms. two of these isomers are enantiomers (i.e. mirror images) of each other, as are the other two isomers. one pair of enantiomers are diastereoisomers of the other pair of enantiomers. using the conventional nomenclature system for enantiomers having known absolute configurations, the four enantiomers can be designated as: (r)c2 (.r)c1 (b) (s)c2 (s)c1 (c) (,r)c2 (s)c1 (d) (s)c2 cr)c1 isomers (a) and (b) are enantiomers of each other and they are diastereoisomers of isomers (c) and (d) which are also enantiomers of each other. british patent application no. 34590/76 discloses the diastereoisomers of the compound wherein r1 is parachlorobenzyl and r2 is t-butyl - see compounds 1 and 5 of table i in british application no. 34590/76. compound 1 is a racemic mixture of an enantiomer wherein both the carbon carrying the triazole ring and the carbon carrying the hydroxy are in the r-configuration, while compound 5 is a racemic mixture of an enantiomer wherein the carbon carrying the triazole ring is in the rconfiguration and the carbon carrying the hydroxy group is in the s-configuration and an enantiomer which is its mirror image; in fact, compound 1 is a racemic mixture of enantiomers (a) and (b) and compound 5 is a racemic mixture of enantiomers (c) and (d). compounds 1 and 5 were found.to have approximately the same activities as plant fungicides and plant growth regulating agents, but compound 1 is generally more active than compound 5. we have now found that when the two enantiomers of a diastereoisomeric mixture of this type are separated there can be a significant separation of the fungicidal and plant growth regulating activities between the two enantiomers. for example, we have resolved compound 1 (which is a racemic mixture) into its enantiomers and have found that one of them, the (+) enantiomer, which is now known from x-ray analysis to be enantiomer (a), has high fungicidal activity but low plant growth regulating activity. the other isomer, the (-) enantiomer / which is enantiomer (buzz has not yet
