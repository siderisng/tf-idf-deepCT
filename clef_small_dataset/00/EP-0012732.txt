<ABSTRACT>
a method of fast moulding a shell-shaped object of a  curable mixture of monomeres or thermosetting resin com­ ponents in a movable mould.  the mixture cures in short time at the mould tempera­ ture.  this time is used for distribution of curable material  over the mould surfaces.  in a modified embodiment the  object is reinforced and in another it is made with a different  material thickness in different parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of making a shell-shaped object of plastic and arral ueent therefor the present invention relates to a method of moulding a shell-shaped object of plastic in a mould and to an arrangement for performing the method. it is known before to produce shell-shaped bodies by so-called rotational moulding of vinyle plastisoles which are created by heating in a heated mould, which is then cooled before demoulding. with rotational moulding originally was meant a method for moulding in which the mould was rotated simultaneously around two axes perpendicular to each other. later, the same process has been used to considerable extent for sintering or melting of fine powders of thermoplastic, which is made in a heated mould which is then cooled before removing the object from the mould. other methods of rotational moulding are known in which one starts with a liquid phase which forms a rigid body developing reaction heat. in most cases one starts with an increased temperature in the mould in which the chemicals in liquid phase are located during a sufficiently long time before a viscosity increase occurs, whereafter the temperature of the mould is further increased in order to cause a fast curing of the material when the liquid has been spread over the mould surface. another known method is described in british patent specification no. 1,380,791 according to which chemicals in liquid phase are cured to a rigid body at room temperature, defined as a temperature between 10 and 43 c. this method does require a low energy consumption but it has the severe drawback that each separate moulding takes too long to make the method suitable in mass production when one starts with chemicals in liquid phase which develop reaction heat as described for rotational moulding, the time required for rotation in order to have the liquid distributed over the mould surface is several minutes and after that further tirne with rotation is required before the curing has advanced so far that the rotation can be allowed to cease. in the said patent specification it is state that rotation during at least 20 - 30 minutes is required for performing the process. the object of the present invention is to remove the said drawback by proposing a method which can be performed by simple means in short time. the method according to the invention is for this purpose characterized by a number of steps stated in the following claim 1. according to the invention a temperature of the mould increased to above ambient is used. chemicals are selected which cure so fast that the time for curing after coating the mould surfaces with the curable material is short. the time required in which the mould has to be kept moving until the liquid has increased so much in viscosity that it is not essentially redistributed in the mould due to gravity hereby can be reduced to the least possible, i.e. so that movements of the mould after distribution of material can be dispensed
