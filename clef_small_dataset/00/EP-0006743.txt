<ABSTRACT>
a spin texture process for producing crimped synthetic filaments is described in which freshly extruded filaments are passed over a 20-180 deg c roll before they are completely solidified and fully drawn as they leave the roll.  in the case of polyamide filaments, spontaneous crimp as well as latent crimp is observed.

<DESCRIPTION>
spin-texture process background of the invention a. field of the invention this invention relates to a novel spin-draw process for producing fully drawn melt spun synthetic filaments, such as, polyester and polyamide filaments, having useful spontaneous crimp and/or latent crimp. as used herein: the term "spontaneous crimp" means crimp observed upon release at ambient temperatures of the tension applied to the filaments during the drawing thereof; the term "latent crimp" means crimp which is not observed even upon release of the drawing tension until the filaments are subjected to heat while relaxed; the term "crimp" means crimp resulting from the additive effect of both spontaneous and latent crimps; the terms "% hot bulk" and " cold bulk" are defined by the equation: emi1.1 where the vertical length (l2) of a sample of filaments having a length (l1) (e.g. 25.4 cm) when fully extended (straight) is measured while being maintained in the vertical position by means of a clamp at the upper end of the sample and a weight of 0.0009 grams per denier attached to the lower end. in determining % hot bulk l2 is determined after the sample has been exposed to 1800c. dry heat for five minutes followed by cooling at ambient conditions for one minute. in determining 70 cold bulk l2 is measured without the sample being first exposed to dry heat. unless otherwise stated herein the term "% bulk" has reference to % hot bulk. cold bulk is a measure of spontaneous crimp while hot bulk is a measure of both spontaneous and latent crimps. b. description of the prior art u.s. 3,832,435 describes a melt spinning process for producing partially drawn polyester filaments having latent crimp. latent crimp is imparted to the filaments after they leave the spinneret by cooling the freshly spun filaments on one side before they completely solidify. the cooling is accomplished by passing the individual filaments over a cooled roll (quench roll) driven at a given peripheral speed. the yarn is passed from the quench roll over a second cooled roll of smaller diameter which is normally stationary or substantially stationary when compared to the speed of the first roll. the filaments are pulled from the second roll at a speed such that they are partially drawn as they leave the second roll. the partially drawn filaments prepared by this process must be further drawn in a separate operation and then heated to develop the latent crimp. it is an object of the present invention to provide a simpler, more economical process for producing polyester filaments having a latent crimp. it is another object of the invention to provide a process for producing in one operation fully drawn polyester filaments having latent crimp. it is still another object of the invention to provide a process which is also useful for imparting both latent crimp and spontaneous crimp to other melt spun synthetic filaments, such as polyamide filaments. summary of the invention the foregoing objects are accomplished by the spin-draw process of

    clat tis     1. a process for   producing    fully drawn melt spun filaments having crimp characterized by:  (a) extruding a fiber-forming synthetic polymer  through orifices of   2    spinneret at an  extrusion rate (er) to form filaments which  cool as they move away from the spinneret  (b) passing the filaments before they are com  pletely solidified over a quench roll with    a wrap angle (&alpha; ;) ), wherein said roll is     rotating at a peripheral speed (s1), is  maintained at a surface temperature (tr) and  is positioned a distance (d) from the  spinneret so that the filaments do not stick  to one another when in contact with said  roll and wherein on the average (tr) is lower  than the temperature at the center of the  filaments, and  (c) drawing the filament at a draw ratio (dr) as  they leave said roll by withdrawing the  filaments from said roll at a speed  (s2) which is greater than (s1), wherein    angles      &alpha; ;)    is of. sufficient magnitude to  prevent   significant    slippage of the filaments  on said roll, wherein   (er),      (tr),    (d) and (dr) are correlated to provide   filaments    having spontaneous and/or latent crimp and   2    bulk of at least 10% when exposed to   180 c.    dry heat for five minutes while relaxed followed by cooling.    2. the process of claim 1 characterized in that (tr) is between about 20 c. and about 180 c.,  3. the process of claim 1 characterized in that (tr) is between about   30 c.    and   about-1000c.        4. the process of claim 1 characterized in that   (dr)    is between about 1.5:1 and about 6:1.      5. the process of claim 1 characterized in that   (er),      (tr),    (d) and   (dr)    are correlated to provide filaments having a bulk of at least 18% when exposed to dry heat for 5 minutes while relaxed following by cooling.    6. the process of claim 1 characterized in that said orifices are of round cross-section.    7. the process of claim 1 characterized in that said polymer is polyethylene terephthalate.    8. the process of claim 1 characterized in that said polymer is polyhexamethylene adipamide.    9. the process of claim 8 characterized in that said filaments have both a latent crimp and a spontaneous crimp.
