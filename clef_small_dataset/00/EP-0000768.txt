<ABSTRACT>
1.  mixing device for connecting to at least the hot-water connection of a hot-water boiler, comprising a cold-water inlet stud (1), a mixed water outlet stud (4) and a thermostatic controlled slider (13) biased at one end by a load spring (17) and being displaceable in a mixing body (14), said body comprising at least two circular rows of control openings (15, 16) in its wall arranged one behind the other in the direction of the slider displacement with one of said control openings only being completely covered by the slider at each time, whereat at or in the area of the bottom (35) of the slider (13) at least one opening (21) is provided and each row of control openings is connected to a ring channel (27, 28) entouring the mixing body (14) and whereat one ring channel (27) is hydraulically connected to the cold-water inlet stud (1) and the other ring channel (28) is hydraulically connected to the hot-water connection, characterized in that the ring channels (27, 28) are formed by the outer wall of the mixing body (14) by three outer flanges (22, 23, 24) spaced apart from each other at said body and by a cylindrical bore (25) in the housing of the mixing device, that the mixing body (14) at its end opposite to the bottom (35) of the slider is closed by means of a bottom (31), whereat the other end of the load spring (17) is supported at the bottom of the mixing body and that the slider (13) is configurated as a single-acting slider whereat the water can flow around both ends of the slider.
