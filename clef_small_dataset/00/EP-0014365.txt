<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new process for producing linear heterocyclic nylon-1 polymers, which is characterized in that alkyl substituted 1.3 diisocyanate cyclohexanes whose isocyanate groups are axially or equatorially, together with catalysts from the lead catalysts, tertiary amines, tertiary amines, Alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal alcoholates existing group heated to a temperature of about 50 ° to about 150 ° C, the use of the obtained linear nylon-1 polymer as capped diisocyanates in the production of polyurethane plastics and the separation of substantially pure cycloaliphatic diisocyanate In the form of the reactive (CIS-form) stereoisomers of cycloaliphatic diisocyanate in the form of non-reactive (transform) stereoisomers according to a method characterized in that a diisocyanate mixture comprising both alkyl-substituted 1,3-diisocyanate cyclohexane in Form of the CIS -Sereaisomers' as well as in the form of the trans- stereoisomers, in the presence of the aforementioned catalysts, which separates linear heterocyclic nylon-1 polymers from the reaction mixture and decomposes the linear nylon 1 polymerisates under distillation conditions, thereby forming a distillate and the distillate, which contains a stereoisomer in the CIS shape, substantially pure monomer, wins.
