<ABSTRACT>
Device for supplying a constant flow a user, with at least one fluid having a variable visco, comprising a fluid source delivering said variable viscosity fluid and a fluid circuit connecting said fluid source to the user. user.It further comprises two mechanically listed volumetric pumps (2 and 3) for their flows to be in a fixed ratio, a first (2) of the two pumps being interposed in the circuit (5, 7) of the variable viscosity fluid, whilethat the second pump (3) is interposed in a second fluid circuit (9), in which circulates a constant viscosity fluid and which comes, downstream of the second pump, means (10,13) of flow adjustment.Constant viscosity fluid.The invention is in particular applicable to a paint spraying installation.
