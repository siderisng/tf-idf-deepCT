<ABSTRACT>
a transaction terminal system includes a user accessible  terminal coupled by a message transmission link to a remote  controller and incorporates a potential user authentication  combination based on an encryption check and arranged so  that the crictical encryption key is not resident nor is transmit足 ted overtly to the user accessible terminal.  the potential user  enters into the terminal a transaction identifier and a first  message from a card together with a second memorized mes足 sage.  the two messages are combined in the terminal to  provide a key which is used to encrypt the transaction iden足 tifier.  the identifier is transmitted to the controller, with and  without encryption by their particular key where the identifier  is encrypted by a key stored in the controller and a compari足 son is performed between the two encrypted forms to test for  validity of the input and an acceptance signal is transmitted  back to the terminal.  other tests can be performed as to the  validity of the transaction and the status of the terminal and  the transmission can be overlayed by levels of encryption and  decryption.  the controller may form part of a host computer  or of an intermediate node or both and authentication may be  performed at the node when the host computer is off-line.
