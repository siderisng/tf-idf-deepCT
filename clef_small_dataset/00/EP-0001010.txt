<ABSTRACT>
a pair of safety closure and container assemblies each  including a container (210), cap (216) and combined  spring and sealing member.  a retention rib is formed on  the inner surface of the skirt of the caps.  a plurality of  retention nibs (224) are formed on the inner surface of the  skirt of the other cap (216).  spring and sealing members  (225) each have a radially projecting flange (236) that  engages the retention rib and the retention nibs (224) to  prevent separation of the spring and sealing members (225)  from the caps (216).  cap and container locking elements  are formed respectively on the inner surfaces of the skirts  (220) of the caps (216) and the outer surfaces of the  mouths (212) of the containers (210).  the cap and container  locking elements are engageable with and disengageable  from each other by combined axial and rotary  motion of the caps (216) relative to the containers (210).   the spring and sealing members (225) bias the cap and  container locking elements toward locked engagement  with each other when the caps (216) are applied to the  containers (210).  the cap and container locking elements  are formed such that the sealing portions (234, 236) of the  spring and sealing members are forced into the mouths  (212) of the containers (210) into sealing engagement  therewith as the caps (216) are rotated relative to the containers  (210) so that the operator does not have to apply  direct axial force to the caps (216) in order to seal the containers  (210).
