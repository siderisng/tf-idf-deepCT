<ABSTRACT>
an ultrasonic inspection apparatus for the inspection  of underwater structures consisting of means for scanning  a beam of ultrasound over the surface of the structure at a  predetermined angle of incidence, means for receiving and  displaying echo signals from the structure indicative of  discontinuities within the structure, the action of the display  means being initiated by control signals derived from  echo signals returning from the surface of the structure,  thereby rendering the displayed signals independent of the  separation between the scanning means and the surface of  the structure.
