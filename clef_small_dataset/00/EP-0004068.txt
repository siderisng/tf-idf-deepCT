<ABSTRACT>
a monitor actuating assembly and a reusable fastener  device for selective attachment to an article.  the assembly,  which may carry an alarm actuating element or the like, is  readily attachable to the article and is constructed to be  released therefrom only by use of a special tool.  the reusable  fastener device includes a body (40) in which a one-piece,  cliplike device (50) is mounted.  the body has a pin  receiving bore (34) and the clip-like device (50) includes a  pair of resilient fingers (58) to frictionally engage the pin (6)  for securing the fastener device (8) and, hence, the article (2)  to the assembly.  the clip-like device (50) is further constructed  so as to receive generally radial force from the tool  so as to pivot the fingers (58) out of engagement with the pin  (6) to enable authorized release of the article from the  assembly.
