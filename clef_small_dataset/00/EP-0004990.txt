<ABSTRACT>
a passive dosing dispenser for issuing, for example, a  predetermined volume of a toilet tank additive solution into a  toilet tank as the water is draining therefrom while the toilet  is flushing.  a preferred dispenser (20) comprises a product  chamber (69) for containing a quantity of a solid type product  (21) which can be dissolved in water to form a toilet tank  additive product solution, a reservoir (65) for containing a  quantity of said solution in fluid communication with said  product chamber (69), an inlet/discharge conduit (80) having  its lowermost end in fluid communication with said reservoir  (65) and its uppermost end in fluid communication with a  syphon tube (44), an air trap (81) disposed adjacent said  inlet/discharge conduit (80) for isolating said product solution  from the toilet tank water in said syphon tube (44) during  quiescent periods, and an air vent (83) in fluid communication  with said reservoir (65) and product chamber (69).  in  operation, while the water in the toilet tank is receding from  about the dispenser (20), a predetermined quantity of said  product solution is syphoned from said reservoir (65)  through the inlet/discharge conduit (80) and is dispensed  through the syphon tube (44).  the dispenser provides a pair  of air-locks when immersed in a full toilet tank which  air-locks isolate the product and product solution from toilet  tank water which surrounds the dispenser during quiescent  periods.
