<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a process for preparing cycloalkanols  and cycloalkanones by oxidation in the liquid phase of  a cycloalkane with 5 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring by means  of a gas containing molecular oxygen, thus obtaining an oxidation  mixture containing cycloalkyl hydroperoxide, which  oxidation mixture is subsequently treated, in the presence of  an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, with a  metal salt that causes decomposition of the cycloalkyl hydroperoxide.  the process according to the invention is characterized  in that, prior to the treatment with the metal salt in a step b),  the acids present in the oxidation mixture are partly or  wholly neutralized in a step a), preferably by addition of an  aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate.  the process according to the invention opens the possibility  to reach a high yield of cycloalkanol and cycloalkanone  at a low alkali consumption.
