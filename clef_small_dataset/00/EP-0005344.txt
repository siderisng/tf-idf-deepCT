<ABSTRACT>
crystallizable, controlled composition interpolymers  consisting essentially of (a) from 80 to 92 mole percent  vinylidene chloride, (b) from 8 to 12 mole percent methyl  methacrylate, and (c) up to 3 weight percent, based on the  combined weight of (a) and (b), of one or more ethylenically  unsaturated comonomers; such interpolymers having  a relative viscosity of at least 1. 40 at 25Â°c as a 1 percent  solution in tetrahydrofuran and being capable of forming  substantially haze-free solutions when present in an  amount of 20 percent solids in a solvent mixture consisting  of 65 percent by weight tetrahydrofuran and 35 percent  by weight toluene.

<DESCRIPTION>
crystallizable controlled composition interpolymers of vinylideinte chloride and methyl methacrylate and meteiod of preparing same while the homopolymer of vinylidene chloride is generally insoluble at room temperature in conventional organic solvents, e.g., in pure tetrahydrofuran, useful materials, soluble in solvents such as mixtures of tetrahydrofuran and toluene at room temperature, can be made hy copolymerization of vinylidene chloride with lesser quantities of other monomers such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate (other c2-c13 alcohol esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid, e.g., methyl methacrylate), vinylidene cyanide, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, and chloroacrylonitrile, vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, vinylidene bromide and the like. these materials find particular use in the cellophane industry where a very thin (usually 0.05 mil - 0.00127 mm) coating of so-called i soluble1 vinylidene chloride polymers is deposited from solvent such as the solvent conbinations mentioned above, on one or both sides of cellophane. this thin coating serves several purposes in that it causes the cellophane film to be a good gas or water-vapor barrier film for packaging purposes where either a loss of or gain in gas or water content of the product would render the product less attractive for sale. in addition, the coating promotes retention of water (which acts as a plasticizer usually along wit some glycol or glycerine) in the cellophane, thus helping to prevent brittle fracture of the film. finally, such coatings provide a heat-sealable outer coating where cellophane, by its very nature, cannot be heat-sealed. for cellophane manufacturers concerned with applying such thin coatings to cellophane, the solubility, heat-seal temperature, flexibility, and water-vapor transmission rate (wvtr) are particularly important properties. usually the desired properties include as low a heat-seal temperature and wvtr as possible coupled with low temperature solubility in inexpensive solvents or solvent combinations. since the wvtr of a vinylidene chloride interpolymer is directly related to the mole percent of vinylidene chloride in the polymer, as the most important factor in the manufacture of such resins, it is advantageous to get the mole percent of vinylidene chloride as high as possible consistent with solubility in the desired workable solvent systems. since high vinylidene chloride content means strong crystalline forces in the polymer, these two factors are diametrically opposed, i.e., high vinylidene chloride content, highly crystalline polymers being the least soluble but offering the lowest wvtr. as the mole percent of vinylidene chloride is raised in a polymer series, it is obvious that a percentage range is reached where the polymers rapidly change from ones which are permanently amorphous or which crystallize only slowly and incompletely in coatings to ones which are highly crystalline and difficult to dissolve. consequently, careful control over the polymer composition during polymerization is needed to avoid the formation of a higher vinylidene chloride content than intended, since such could result in polymers unsuitable for coating purposes due to insolubility or premature crystallization in solution. the tendency for such polymers to be insoluble or prematurely crystallize in solution may be measured by light transmission measurements of a 15 to 20
