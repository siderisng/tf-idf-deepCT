<ABSTRACT>
in the production of graft polymer a solution of synthetic  rubbery polymer dissolved in monomer containing methyl  methacrylate and optionally other monomers, particularly  styrene, is continuously introduced into a reactor where it is  polymerized at a temperature of 161 to 195°c.  and preferably  a pressure of 0. 689 to 1. 21 mnm⁻² gauge.  after an appropriate  residence time, preferably not more than 90 minutes, the  resulting graft polymer, which comprises a rubbery dispersed  and a continuous phase containing methyl methacrylate  units, is continuously withdrawn from the reactor.  the graft  polymer, which may have a desirable balance of impact  resistance, melt flow and other properties, is useful as an  impact modifier, particularly for polystyrene.
