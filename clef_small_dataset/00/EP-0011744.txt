<ABSTRACT>
a light grid arrangement features a row of light emitting  diodes 0 to 9 which are periodically switched on one after the  other by a ring counter 11 and are arranged to direct their  light through a monitoring region 23 towards an image form­ ing optical means which is conveniently in the form of a  concave mirror 24.  the light beams are concentrated by the  concave mirror 24 onto a photodetector 18 arranged behind  a slot aperture 25 located at the focal point of the concave  mirror.  missing pulses from the photodetector are detected  by processing circuitry 26 to indicate obstruction of the light  grid.  the width of the slot aperture 25 restricts the width of each  individual light beam so that only beams of light from the  light emitting diodes that are generally parallel to the axis of  the concave mirror are detected.  in this way costly optical  focussing elements are avoided as are the difficulties of  aligning these optical elements with the other optical com­ ponents of a system.  the length of the monitored region can  be increased as desired by placing a number of concave mir­ ror and light emitting diode arrangements alongside one  another.
