<ABSTRACT>
a laminated film or sheet structure comprising bonded  films monoaxially orientated in a direction oblique to the  longitudinal direction is provided.  the structure is composed  of (i) and adhesive layer (a), (ii) synthetic resin film layers  (b₁) and (b₂) monoaxially oriented in a direction oblique to  the longitudinal direction of the film, said layers (b₁) and (b₂)  being bonded together by said layer (a), the directions of the  monoaxial orientations of said layers (b₁) and (b₂) crossing  each other, end (iii) a substantially non-oriented synthetic  resin film layer (c₁) and/or a substantially non-oriented  synthetic resin film layer (c₂), said layers (c₁) and/or (c₂)  being melt-adhered to both or one of said layers (b₁) and  (b₂) said layers (c₂) and/or (c₂) having a lower orientation  temperature than said layers (b₁) and (b₂).  the structures are  heat sealable and resistant to delamination and have a good  balance of strengths in the longitudinal and transverse direc­ tions.  processes for the production of the structure are also  provided.
