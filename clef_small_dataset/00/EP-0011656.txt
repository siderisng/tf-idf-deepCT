<ABSTRACT>
a doweling jig requiring minimal adjustment for drilling  multiple like-size mating dowel pin holes in workpieces of  varying thicknesses, dependant on the configuration of fixed  position drill guides or bushings.  the jig is generally of chan­ nel construction (10), with reversible clamping for use on  double jigs of one or two channels.  each side of a double jig  may differ in configuration and size of its fixed position drill  guides.  of the many construction methods, two use inter­ changeable heads (14) containing one or more drill guide  configurations (15).  the use of pivotal stop disk (21 and 22) at  each end of the channel lessens visual alignment.

<DESCRIPTION>
doweling jig this invention relates broadly to small and relatively light hand tools for use in carpentry and cabinetry and more particularly to improvements in a doweling jig of the type that is clamped directly to the work and adapted for use with wood or composition board. in woodworking and similar arts many expedients have been employed for drilling matching dowel pin holes in order to join members with concealed dowel pins so that they present aligned surfaces. various doweling jigs are disclosed in the prior art such as in u.s. patents 2,522,400; 2,260,784; 3,708,237; 2,583,283 and 2,602,238. these prior art doweling jigs concern setup or adjustments that are necessary each time a different thickness of lumber is used. the principal object of this invention is to provide a jig with fixed position drill guides or bushings for the accurate drilling of multiple, like-size matching dowel pin holes for the joining of wood with concealed dowel pins, with the pieces being precisely positioned and aligned. another object of the invention is to provide a jig with means by which it can be quickly, accurately and securely positioned on the workpiece and one requiring minimal visual alignment; with such alignment, when necessary, being done with an end of the jig, which affords excellent visibility with a mark on the edge or face of the workpiece to designate the relative position of the pieces to be joined. in accordance with the invention, there is provided a dowel jig for use in drilling matching holes in two separate pieces of stock characterized by a horizontally elongated channel having a flat top and two parallel side members, said top member having an undersurface parallel with its upper surface and having a longitudinally spaced series of vertical guide bushings through which a drill bit can pass for making spaced holes in the piece of stock held in contact with said undersurface, one of said side members having attached means for clamping the piece of stock longitudinally against the other side member and said undersurface in a position for drilling operation thereon, an eccentric stop disk at each end of. said channel to form a trihedral angle and constituting a stop against which the end or the edge of the stock is positioned thereto, each of said stops being pivotal to move out of such stop position. the invention will be described with reference to the drawings in which: figure 1 is an isometric view of one form of; the jig of the invention; figure 2 is similar to figure 1, except that the drill head has been removed; figure 3 shows a drill head in reverse configuration for ease of illustration, with various configurations of drilling holes with an extended portion for fitting into the cut out portion of the channel of figure 2; figure 4 is a partially sectional isometric view of another form of the dowel jig having a reversible clamping plate and a dual channel; figure 5 is an isometric view of

 claims   1. a dowel jig for use in drilling matching holes in two separate pieces of stock characterized by a horizontally elongated channel having a flat top and two parallel side members, said top member having an undersurface parallel with its upper surface and having a longitudinally spaced series of vertical guide bushings through which a drill bit can pass for making spaced holes in the piece of stock held in contact with said undersurface, one of said side members having attached means for clamping the piece of stock longitudinally against the other side member and said undersurface in a position for drilling operation thereon, an eccentric stop disk at each end of said channel to form a trihedral angle and constituting a stop against which the end or the edge of the stock is positioned thereto, each of said stops being pivotal to move out of such stop position.   2. a dowel jig according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the top of the channel is provided with a large opening and the guide bushings are located in separate plate removably affixed over said openings.   3. a dowel jig according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that one of the side members is pivotally connected to the undersurface of the flat top of the channel to form the clamping means when in its aligned position to form said channel, said side member being moved into clamping position by the action of an eccentric activating means.   4. a dowel jig according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized by the fact that  at least one of the side members contains an open ended slot having a threaded portion at its closed end and said clamping means comprises a pressure plate affixed to an adjustment screw having two parallel flat surfaces which allows passage of said screw into said slot and in engagement with said threaded portion to allow movement of said pressure plate against the piece of stock by rotation of said screw in one direction and release of the stock when rotated in the opposite direction.   5. a dowel jig according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the channel contains a spacer fence dividing the channel into a first channel and a second channel, each of said first and second channels having a longitudinally spaced series of vertical guide bushings and said clamping means being reversible to allow clamping the piece of stock longitudinally against either side of said spacer fence.   6. a dowel jig according to claim 5, characterized by the fact that the clamping means fits into an open ended slot in the lower surface of each of the side members and comprises a pressure plate rotatably connected to an adjustment screw passing through said slot, said screw having a nut with two flat parallel sides which fit into said slot and a threaded end, a stop means secured to said nut opposite to said threaded end for pressing against one side of said slotted side member and a second nut for pressing against the opposite surface of said side member when screwed onto said threaded end of said first nut thereby firmly clamping  said adjustment screw into said slot without interfering with the lateral movement of the adjustment screw against said pressure plate for securing the piece of stock in drilling position.    7. a dowel jig according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized by the fact that the vertical guide bushings are aligned parallel to one of the side members and are two in number, each guide bushing being spaced the same distance from its corresponding open end of the channel as the other guide bushing.   8. a dowel jig according to claim 7, characterized by a third bushing spaced equal distance from each open end of the channel.
