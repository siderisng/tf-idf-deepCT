<ABSTRACT>
Device for cooling the chisel (24) from substantially a horizontal axis (5) rotatably mounted shrubs (6, 6 ') and the spatial breast (9), including water nozzles (15, 16), wherein on both sides of the Schränarmes (2) each a shrine head (6, 6 ') is mounted. In order to achieve sufficient cooling of the chisel and the chest in the case of the smallest possible water consumption, two groups of nozzles (15, 15 ', 16, 16') are arranged at the chrinal arm (2) for each closure head (6.6 '), wherein the nozzles (15,15 ') of a first group directed to the region of the highest position of the chisel (24), and the nozzles (16, 16') of the second group to the spaces (43) between chisel rows in the area mentioned Highest position of the chisel are directed. The water supply to each of the two jet groups associated with a jet head is separately shut-off, and since only one closure head is engaged with the material to be shrinked in the horizontal, the water drove to the nozzle groups associated with this shrine head is opened and separately from the water supply The nozzle group associated with the other Schrärkopf.
