<ABSTRACT>
a battery-powered receiver having a switch (s) for  disconnecting the battery (b) from radio frequency detec­ tion circuits within the receiver upon receipt of a sequence  of coded address and command signals.  each address and  command signal is a radio frequency modulated with an  audio or tone frequency.  a tone decoder (td) within the  receiver is sensitive to audio signals whose frequencies lie  within any one of sixteen predetermined frequency ranges.   stored at the output of the decoder is an address code of  two or more numbers representing tone frequencies, these  numbers being representative of the particular receiver or  group of receivers.  a sequence of audio signals detected  by the tone detector is compared with the stored address  code.  if the address signals are followed by a coded com­ mand signal, made up of a tone signal or sequence of tone  signals, the tone detector gives an output which causes  the battery switch to be opened for a time determined by  the coding of the command signal.
