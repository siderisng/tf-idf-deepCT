<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a process for the preparation of  an acrylate copolymer having a number average molecular  weight of 400-2000 by polymerization of a monomer mixture  consisting of 35-60 mole % of styrene and/or Î±-methyl  styrene, 20-60 mole % of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid  and 0-30 mole % of one or more other monovinyl compounds  in the presence of a 2 to 8 carbon atoms-containing  mercaptomonocarboxylic acid or mercaptodicarboxylic acid  as chain length regulator in an amount of 0. 05 to 0. 2 moles  per mole of the monomeric compounds, after which the  resulting reaction product is brought into reaction with a  glycidyl ester of a monocarboxylic acid.  the invention also  relates to a liquid coating composition having a solids content  of at least 60% by weight based on the acrylate  copolymer thus prepared and a curing agent.
