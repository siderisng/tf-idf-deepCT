<ABSTRACT>
Thermal decomposition process of alumina aluminum chloride, using a strongly expanded fluidized flow fluidized condition called "turbulent zone" to which are associated, on the one hand a solids concentration gradient from the bottom at the top of the Fluidized bed, and, on the other hand, an evacuation of solid products at the same time as the gases at the top of the "turbulent zone", method wherein: - hydrated aluminum chloride is contacted with gases Hot for the purpose of obtaining at least partial decomposition, before being introduced into the "turbulent zone", then is led to the "turbulent zone". - the solid products evacuated with the gases at the upper part of the "turbulent zone" are separated and introduced into a "living area", fluidized with a low gas speed, zone from which a partial stream of solid products is returned controlledly into the "turbulent zone" in order to adjust the density of the suspension within it to a determined value, and where another partial stream is sent, after a sufficiently long residence time , towards a fluidized bed cooling which operates with a gas containing oxygen as a fluidization gas. At least a portion of the heated fluidization gas that exits fluidized bed cooling is introduced as secondary gas in the "turbulent zone" above the main gas supply of fluidization. - The heating of the "turbulent zone" is made by fuel supply in the region between the main gas supply of fluidization and the secondary gas supply process which is characterized by the fact that the chloride of Hydrate and wet aluminum in contact with turbulent state and with hot calcined product supplied from the process itself and that there is at least partially decomposed.
