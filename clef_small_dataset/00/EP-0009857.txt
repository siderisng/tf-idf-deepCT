<ABSTRACT>
a fly ash agglomerator for improving the efficiency of the electrostatic precipitators.  contaminated gas is passed through a charger wherein suspended particles become electrically charged, and thence past a plurality of parallel plates aligned with the flow direction.  an ac voltage source applied to the plates subjects the charged particles to a high voltage ac field, which causes the larger-sized particles to sweep past the smaller-sized particles.  the smaller particles adhere to the larger particles, thereby increasing the mean particle size.  the gas stream is then passed through a collector to remove the particles from the gas stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
fly ash agglomerator acknowledgement this invention was made under contract with or supported by the electric power research institute, inc. of palo alto, california. background of the invention the problem of removing suspended particulate matter from a gas stream is present in a variety of industrial and utility applications. for example, coal often contains inorganic minerals such as silica and alumina to the extent of up to 10% of its weight. when this coal is burned in furnaces in either a pulverized or coarsely crushed form, the residual ash from the coal becomes entrained in the furnace gas in the form of finely divided particles, referred to as fly ash. when pulverized coal is used, substantially all of the ash is emitted, but even with coarsely crushed coal, approximately 20% of the ash present is emitted from the furnace. thus, the exhaust gases from a coal-fired central station electrical plant contain large amounts of fly ash. fly ash particles range down in size to the submicron region. as emission standards for particulates in flue gases have become increasingly stringent, it has become increasingly important to efficiently remove the suspended particulate matter. moreover, it is highly desirable that improvements in the technology be adaptable to existing pollution control apparatus, to minimize the cost of conformance to the increasingly strict requirements. the most commonly used device for the removal of particulate matter from power plant stack gases is the electrostatic precipitator. the theory of operation and typical design considerations are extensively set forth in h.j. white, "industrial electrostatic precipitation" (addison-wesley 1963), hereinafter referred to as white. broadly, an electrostatic precipitator removes suspended particulate matter from a gas stream by causing the particles to become electrically charged, and sweeping them out of the gas stream by means of an electrostatic field, normally transverse to the flow direction. of the several possible charging methods, the high voltage dc corona is almost universally used in electrostatic precipitators. the corona is most often established between one or more fine wires, normally at a large negative voltage, and a grounded smooth electrode. the particles passing through the corona field are charged according to two mechanisms, bombardment (or field) charging and diffusion charging. both of the charging mechanisms take place at the same time, but, theoretically, diffusion charging is predominant for particles smaller than 0.2 microns in diameter, while bombardment charging is predominant for particles larger than 0.5 microns in diameter. if all the corona wires are operated at the same polarity, the charging is said to be unipolar. under such conditions, it still may be very difficult to convert all the particles to the same polarity, especially when the dust loading is high. the charged particles then start to move toward collector plates according to a high voltage dc field. in most industrial clean-up applications, the electrodes for providing the collection field are the same as the corona electrodes. such precipitators are called single stage precipitators. most precipitators used for air cleaning applications are two-stage precipitators in
