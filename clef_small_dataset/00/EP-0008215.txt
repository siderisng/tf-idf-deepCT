<ABSTRACT>
a clear solution is prepared by reacting metal alkoxi­ de with a mixture of critical amounts of water and/or acid  in an alcohol diluted medium.  alkoxides may be ti(or)₄ or  ta(or)₅, or another metal alkoxide such as si(or)₄ in ad­ mixture with these alkoxides.  acids may be hcl or hno₃.   quarter wave inorganic optical coatings are deposited by  applying the alkoxide solution to a substrate then heating  the coating at over 350°c.  the coatings reduce reflectivity  on silicon solar cells.  the index of refraction of the coating  can be varied by several techniques, including altering the  proportion of titanium and silicon in the coating firing tem­ perature, firing atmosphere.  thicknesses of the coating  can be controlled by varying the rpm in spin application,  withdrawal rate in dipping application, by concentration of  the solution, by the type of solvent or the degree of poly­ merization of the titanium complexes.
