<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed an integrated optical design of head-up  displays suitable for use in aircraft cockpits and the like.  the  display system is comprised of a holographic optical element  (11) used as the combiner for presenting a direct view of the  exterior on which are superimposed image signals generated  by a source device (51) such as a cathode ray tube (12) and  transmitted to the combiner through an optical system (10)  including a relay lens containing tilted and decentered optical  elements to compensate for the aberration present in the  holographic optical element (11).  there are further disclosed  four relay lens design forms particularly suited for use in the  design of such holographic head-up displays.  the disclosure  includes integrated designs in which (a) the holographic eleÂ­ ment (11) may or may not be constructed with aberrated  wavefront and (b) a beam splitter is incorporated for insertion  of a stand-by sight, possibly also being tilted for the correction  of aberrations.
