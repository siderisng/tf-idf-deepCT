<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a particulate sealing material  for use in preparing hermetic seals between ceramic and  cermet members, which material comprises at least 70 wt. %  refractory oxide and minor quantities of non-vitreous ad­ ditive comprising sio₂, mgo and b₂o₃.  this particulate  sealing material is conveniently pressed into the form of a  coherent element shaped to suit the particular sealing op­ eration concerned, e. g.  the sealing of an open end of a  ceramic arc tube to a cermet closure therefor.  the inven­ tion also provides a method of sealing a ceramic compo­ nent to a cermet member by interposing said sealing mate­ rial between the opposed faces of the component and  member and applying heat and pressure to sinter the seal­ ing material and achieve a seal between the component  and member.
