<ABSTRACT>
in the moulding of plastics material using a female mould  cavity (2) into which a number of cores (3a-c) are inserted, in  order to prevent deflection of the cores under the action of the  injected plastics material, complementarily shaped forma­ tions (5, 6 and 7, 8) are provided on the free ends of the cores  and the mould wall, the formations being so disposed and  arranged as to produce restoring forces tending to reduce  deflection of the cores and to prevent transmission of deflec­ tion between adjacent cores.  various examples of suitable  formations are disclosed.  the invention is illustrated with  reference to its application to the manufacture of battery  boxes.
