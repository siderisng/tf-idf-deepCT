<ABSTRACT>
a self-priming passive dosing dispenser (120) for  issuing, beginning with the first flush, a quantity of a toilet  tank additive solution into a toilet tank as the water is  draining therefrom while the toilet is flushing.  a preferred  dispenser (120) comprises a reservoir (143) for contain­ ing a quantity of a toilet tank additive type product (121)  and in which reservoir a solid type product can be dissolv­ ed to form a product solution.  means are provided for  flooding the reservoir through the discharge standpipe  (144) upon initial immersion of the dispenser (120) into  the toilet tank water to ensure first flush dispensing of pro­ duct solution.  in steady state operation, while the water in  the toilet tank is receding from about the dispenser, a pre-­ determined dose-volume of toilet tank water is vacuum-­ transferred from a measuring cavity (141) located within  said dispenser into said reservoir (143) through an inlet  conduit (142), and a substantially, equal dose-volume of  the product solution is dispensed through a discharge  standpipe (144).  the dispenser (120) may further com­ prise an internal baffle (136) to precipitate mixing and  agitation inside the dispenser which promote dissolution.   upon reaching steady state operation, the dispenser pro­ vides an air-lock when immersed in a full toilet tank which  air-lock isolates the product (121) and product solution  from toilet tank water which surrounds the dispenser during  quiescent periods.  plural product co-dispensers which  embody the present invention are also disclosed.
