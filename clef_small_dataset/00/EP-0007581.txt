<ABSTRACT>
a cooled mold assembly (18) for the continuous high  speed casting of metallic strands (12), especially upcasting  strands of copper alloys such as brass.  the four cooled mould  assemblies (18) are mounted on an insulated water header  (20).  a withdrawal machine (22) draws the strands through  the mould assemblies and directs them to a pair of booms (24  + 24â€²) that guide the strands to four pouring type coilers (26)  where the strands are collected in coils.  each boom (24) is  hollow to conduct cooling air supplied by the ducts (28) along  the length of the boom.  the melt (14) is produced in one or  several melt furnaces.  a ladle (30) carried the melt from the  melt furnace to the casting furnace (16).  the ladle (30) is  pivotally seated in support cradle (32) on a casting platform  (34).  a ceramic pouring up (36) funnels the melt from the ladle  (30) to the interior of the casting furnace.  the casting furnace  is supported on a hydraulic, scissortype elevator and dolly  (38).  the casting furnace (16) is a coreless induction furnace  with a rammed alumina lining heated by a power supply (40);  capacity of the furnace is five tons of the melt.  the furnace (16)  has a pour-off spout that feeds to an overfill and pour-off ladle  (42).  the withdrawal machine (22) has four opposed pairs of  drive rolls (44).  the rolls are secured on a common shaft  driven by a servo controlled reversible hydraulic motor (46).
