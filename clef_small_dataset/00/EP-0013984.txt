<ABSTRACT>
In a method and apparatus for rolling (enforcing) an endless belt in a supply, in particular a film strip, is the entire tape supply to be performed on a substantially hori zontal supporting device (1), which is made of one to a vertical axis Stationary core (D) is where at least three rotatable concentrible annular discs (A, B and C) are arranged. The outer annular disk (a) is driven by means of changeable rotational speed controlled in response to a reciprocating speed, the inner annular disk (c) is also driven in response to a changeable speed controlling the unwinding speed controllable speed and the intermediate annular disc (n) (B1 ,,, N) With either the outer annular disc (A) or the inner annular disc (C) corresponding speed to drivable. The film strap is guided to the projector (7) arranged on the core (D) arranged on the core (D) and then restarted on the outer winding of the band supply.
