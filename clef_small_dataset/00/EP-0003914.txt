<ABSTRACT>
a dialysis composition for adsorption of uremic substances  in an artificial kidney is described, comprising a  cation exchanger suspended in a suspending agent.  a more  particular example of such a composition comprises a surface  adsorptive agent capable of adsorption of uremic substances;  an enzyme to serve as a catalyst for urea degradation;  a suspending agent; and a cation exchanger capable of  being suspended in said suspending agent.  a method for  removing uremic substances from blood during  hemodialysis with the above dialysis compositions is also  described.
