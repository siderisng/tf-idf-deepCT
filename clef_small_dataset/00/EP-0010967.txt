<ABSTRACT>
compositions useful for curing polyurethane prepolymers,  a process for their preparation and curable  compositions prepared from them are described.  to a  dispersion of a complex of 3 moles of 4,4′-methylenedianiline  with 1 mole of a specified inorganic salt,  preferably sodium chloride, in an inert liquid, which still  contains some free methylenedianiline, there is added,  with agitation, at least 0. 5 equivalent of an organic isocyanate  per equivalent of free methylenedianiline.  then,  there is added, while continuing agitation, at least 0. 5  weight % of lecithin.  the resulting dispersion is a good  curing agent for isocyanato-terminated polyurethane  prepolymers.  compositions containing both the prepolymer  and the curing agent of this invention have good  shelf stability at room temperature and cure to polyurethane  products having good physical properties and  hydrolytic stability.
