<ABSTRACT>
the disclosure is directed to a semi-automatic mail  insertion machine which assists an operator in placing  materials into envelopes (26).  the machine includes a  horizontal conveyor (20, 21) which, under operator con­ trol, incrementally advances the envelopes (26) to be pro­ cessed from one processing station to another in suc­ cession.  an envelope stacker (25) is positioned above  the conveyor (20, 21) and a feed means (55, 56) feeds the  envelopes (26) to the conveyor (20, 21) prior to each  advancement of the conveyor.  the envelopes (26) are  conveyed to a first process station (30) which auto­ matically unfolds the pre-folded unsealed envelope flaps.   the envelopes are then advanced to a second proces­ sing station (35) which opens the envelopes and presents  the envelopes to the operator in a manner which permits  ready placement of materials into the envelopes.  a third  processing station (45) may be provided which weighs  the envelopes and the material therein to facilitate the  sorting of the processed envelopes by weight.
