<ABSTRACT>
In a measurement method for determining errors on printed sheets and traces, in particular sliding and / or dubing, the measuring fields (3-6) of a measuring field block (2) are measured by means of a remission gauge (8) on a measuring table (7). The measuring field block (2) is printed parallel to the arc front edge on the sheet (1) and webs and consists of four related measurement fields (3-6), one of which are a full-tone (3) and the three remaining line grid measurement fields (4-6) whose lines have different scanning angles with each other with each other with the same angular difference. Grid width and rastertone values ​​in the film are the same in the three line grid meters. From the metrologically detected four remission values ​​is determined by linking with each other and by their computational evaluation of the raster tone value in pressure with deduction of the influence of pushing and / or dubing, the size of pushing and / or dubing as well as the sliding and / or dual angle and the Operating staff optionally displayed in value.
