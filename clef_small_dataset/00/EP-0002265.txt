<ABSTRACT>
a machine for sawing stones includes one or more  reciprocable blade-carrying frames (5).  for combining the  technical assets of blade frames and those of disk mills an  actuating mechanism (4) for said blade-carrying frame (5) is  provided, which moves said frame (5) substantially parallel  to itself along a preselected elliptical path.  an embodiment  of the machine presents an approach by which the stresses  on the pivotal and connection pins (13) are considerably  reduced by exploiting appropriate balancing contrivances,  such as counterweights located at appropriate points of the  specially provided balancing connecting rods.  a longer  service life is thus provide both to the blades and the  machine as a whole.
