<ABSTRACT>
broadband amplifier having two transistor stages.  for the control voltage to be output by the first stage to be as low as possible, the emitter-collector path of the first transistor (31) and the base- emitter path of the second transistor (32) are connected in parallel with respect to alternating voltage.  in the connections which are in parallel with respect to alternating voltage, at least one electrical isolating point is provided.  the amplifier can be used, in particular, as line amplifier in carrier frequency engineering.  <image>
