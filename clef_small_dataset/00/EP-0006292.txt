<ABSTRACT>
a tire press unloader for a tire curing press of the up­ standing bladder type includes a pivoting tire platform (107)  mounted for vertical movement on a horizontally movable  unloader frame (51).  the platform includes a pivot control  member (143) to keep the same from pivoting during initial  upward movement and then require the same to pivot dur­ ing the final vertical movement, the control member also  requires the platform to return to its horizontal position as  it starts downwardly.  obstructions in the path of the control  member require such pivotal movement.  the tire platform  (107) is mounted on a pivoting horizontal shaft (84) dis­ posed in vertical slots (80) in the unloader frame and the  pivot control member is secured to the shaft for common  pivotal movement.  when the press is opened and the cured  tire has been elevated by the bladder mechanism, the tire  platform is positioned beneath the cured tire to support the  tire as the bladder is stripped therefrom.  the tire platform is  then elevated thus vertically to lift the tire over the top of  the upstanding bladder to cause the tire to slide down by  gravity to a retractable two element centering tire stop.  the  tire stop is retracted and the tire rolls into a pci or out of  the press.
