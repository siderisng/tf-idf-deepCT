<ABSTRACT>
dual path moving walkway of the type where pallets  of treadplates circulate about the terminal ends has a swiv­ el joint connecting the inner sides to enable the pallets to  move in a horizontal plane or up an incline.  the swivel  joint consists of overlapping links mounted at the trailing  edge of one pallet and the leading edge of the adjacent  pallet and interconnected by vertical pivot pin which carr­ ies a ring located in an aperture in one of the links.  the  outer surface of the ring and the corresponding wall of the  aperture are spherical to permit relative movement in a  vertical plane between the ring and the link.  consequently,  the adjacent pallets can pivot relative to each other in a  horizontal plane and in a vertical plane.
