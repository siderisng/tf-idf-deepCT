<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for visual suppression of the frame changing movement in projection devices with image reproduction surfaces which are to be enlarged and are movable in the path of the rays (1), with a projection lens (11) and a light dimming device in the path of the rays (1) which is effective during the frame change and through which the projection surface is given a brightness value during frame change, which roughly corresponds to the medium transparence of the image reproduction surface, characterised in that the light dimming device is a liquid crystal cell (9) acting as a diffusor which is arranged in the path of the rays (1) and is connected with a control device (21) for controlling the liquid crystal cell (9) so as to be transparent during image reproduction and to diffuse during frame change.
