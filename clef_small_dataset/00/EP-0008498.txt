<ABSTRACT>
an immobilized enzyme preparation, its production and  its use in which an enzyme is immobilized on particles having  amino groups on their surfaces, a dispersion of the particles  being produced by a specified process.  preferably the parti­ cles comprise inert inorganic fillers such as sand encapsu­ lated in polyamide polymers or copolymers.  the enzyme pre­ paration may be used in the following enzyme catalysed  conversions:-   lactose to glucose and galactose; glucose to fructose;  and starch to glucose.
