<ABSTRACT>
Transparent copolyamides are described which are described by reacting a mixture a) from substantially stoichiometric amounts of a diamine of the formula and isophthalic acid, a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid or amide-forming derivatives thereof in a molar ratio of isophthalic acid (derivative): Terephthal acid (derivative) of 5 : 5 to 10: 0 with a mixture B) of substantially stoichiometric amounts of a diamine of the formula and a dicarboxylic acid of the formula Hooc-Z-COOH (III) or an amide-forming derivative thereof [R₁ to R₄ = independent of each other H or C₁₋₄-alky, portion of mixture a) 40-60 wt. % and R₅ and R₆ = independently of one another optionally by C₁₋₄-alkyl substituted cycloalkyl with 5-12 ring C atoms, isopropyl, SEK-butyl or isobutyl or portion of mixture a) 50-70 wt. % R₅ / R₆ = -CH (R₇) (R₈), R₇ = H, C₂₋₈-alkyl, R₈ C₂₋₈-alkyl and Z = C₄₋₁₄ alkylene. The new copolyamides are characterized by good thermoplastic processability, low water uphill and good hydrolysis resistance and are suitable for the production of transparent moldings.
