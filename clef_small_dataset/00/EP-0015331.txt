<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to furniture and, more particu­ larly, to apparatus for providing a resilient edge support  in furniture having a support member and a load bearing  seat portion.  according to the present invention there is provided  apparatus (10) for providing a resilient edge support in  furniture having a support member (25) and a load bea­ ring seat portion (27) comprising a plurality of projections  (13, 14 and 15) for spacing the seat portion (27) from the  support member portion (24), a wire (22) for supporting  material defining the said edge and a plurality of projec­ tions (16, 17 and 18) for locating the wire (22) in spaced  relation above the projections (13, 14 and 15) thereby to  provide resilient support for the wire (22).  the invention principally is used as a framework for  covering furniture with upholstery fabric which is laid over  the apparatus 10 to provide a resilient edge of a seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
description this invention relates to furniture and, more particularly, to apparatus for provii e resilient edge support in furniture having a support member and a load bear seat portion. in the furniture and upholstery industry, one method of providing a seat is to fabricate a support member and to locate on or in the support member a load bearing portion. generally the load bearing portion is arranged to provide resilient support when sat on but comfort is impaired, at least at a front edge of the sat, due to a rid portion of the support member defining, or supporting material defining, the said cage. various proposals nave been made to provide an edge support which is resilient. however, the proposals have included apparatus which is intended to be additional to seats comprising support members carrying load bearing portions in accordance with existing techniques. a disadvantage of such proposed resilient edge supports is that, because they are each supported on a resilient load bearing portion, they will mo@e when forces are applied to and released from the lo@d bearing portion causing stress in material supported by the resilient edge supports and eventual fracture of the material. according to the resent invention, there is provided apparatus for providing a resilient edge support in furniture having a support member and o load bearing seat portion, wherein the apparatus cotnprises:- means adapted to be secured to a portion of the support member for spacing the seat portion from the support member portion, means for supporting material defining the said edge, and means for locating the support means in spaced relation above the spacing means so that when a lead is applied to the support m@ans in a direction towerds the sp@cing means, the locating means is reslliently deflected towards the spacing means. the locating means may comprise a first series of members snd the support means msy comprise a first elengste member connecting the membors of the first series. the securing means may comprise @ second series of rembers extending parallel one to anether and each adapted to engage a second elongate member extending at right angles to the parallel axes of the second series of members, the second elongste member extend- ing parallel to the first elongate member. the first and second elongate members may comprise opposite sides of a rectangular frame. the members of the first series of members are integral with corresponding ones of members of the second series of members. the members of the first and second series of members are of a single integral construction. alternatively, each member of the first series is integral with a corresponding member of the second series each of the members of the first and second series comprises two spaced parallel portions of wire connected by a bridging portion. following is a description by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings of one method of carrying the invention into effect. in the drawings: # figure 1 is a perspective view
