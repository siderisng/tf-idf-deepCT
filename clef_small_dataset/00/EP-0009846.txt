<ABSTRACT>
a thinly coated steel wire, which preferably has a diame­ ter of 0. 05 to 0. 75 mm, is provided for reinforcing an article  which is vulcanizable with sulphur to produce an elastomer  such as rubber for vehicle tires.  the thin coating is formed by  an alloy which, in addition to copper and zinc, contains 2 to  19 per cent by weight of nickel.  the coated steel wire has  improved adhesion to rubber during vulcanization.  the  invention also provides reinforcing cable or cord made from  the steel wire and articles of elastomeric material reinforced  with it, such as vehicle tires.  a process is also provided for  the manufacture of the coated steel wires.

<DESCRIPTION>
steel wire coated with a meta± alloy, reinforcl g jab4e#o4 coard made from it and objects of elastomeric material reinforced with it, and a process for the manufacture of these steel wires. the invention relates to steel wire, more particularly steel wire having a diameter of 0,05 to 0,75 mm, for reinforcing a material vulcanizable with sulphur to obtain an elastomer, such as rubber for vehicle tyres, which wire is covered with a thin coating of an alloy which at least consists of copper and zine and can be bonded to the elastomeric material during the vulcanization process the invention also comprises reinforcing cable or cord made from these steel wires and objects of elastomeric material reinforced with it, more particularly pneumatic tyres for vehicles. the invention, also relates to a process for the manufacture of said steel wires. steel wires and processes of the type indicated above are known. for instance in the automobile tyre manufacturing industry large scale use is made for the reinforcement of rubber with steel cord built up from a number of wires or filaments covered with a thin coating of brass. then the steel cords made up of brass-coated wires or filaments are first brought into contact with unvulcanized rubber. subsequently, the rubber is subjected to a vulcanization treatment in which the adhesion between rubber and brass is effected. the brass-coated steel i cords generally make it possible to attain a reasonable adhesion level if the various process conditions, particularly during vulcanization, and the properties and/or the state of the starting rubber are accurately controlled. it is generally known that the tyres of both passenger cars and lorries are subjected to severe loading conditions, more particularly high speeds and overloading, and are yet required to have a long life. if the reinforcing steel cord present in the automobile tyre is to perform its function properly, then the bond between cord and rubber must both be strong and permanent. in other words, the adhesion between steel cord and rubber plays an essential role. in this connection the adhesion between cord and rubber has for many years been the subject of a great deal of research both by manufacturers of automobile tyres and manufacturers of steel cord. particularly as a result of the extremely high dynamic loads to which automobile tyres are subjected nowadays the demands made on the adhesion between steel cord and rubber have become so high that even brass-coated steel filaments do not provide satisfacto y adhesion under all circumstances. as to the degree of adhesion, i.e. bonding strength, between steel cord and brass-coated filaments a distinction should be made between initial adhesion and adhesion after aging. initial adhesion is generally determined on cord by means of a tensile tester, the cord having been bonded by vulcanization to rubber which has not undergone any aging treatment. adhesion after aging may be classified into adhesion after green aging and adhesion after steam aging. in the case of adhesion after green aging the unvulcanized rubbe
