<ABSTRACT>
a percussive tool has a percussion mechanism driven  by a linkage that combines the simplicity of a connecting  rod drive with the compactness of more complex drives.   a first member, which may be a crank (6), drives a sec­ ond member, which may be a cylinder (20) mounted for  sliding and pivotal movement in a guide (22).  a piston  (21) is mounted for reciprocating movement in the cylin­ der (20).  rotation of the crank (6) reciprocates the piston  (21) causing blows to be imparted to a tool piece.  the  tool piece is rotated as well as being subjected to per­ cussion.
