<ABSTRACT>
an expandable carrier apparatus for transferring a tire  component such as tread and a radial tread ply band from a  first work station to a further work station in a tire building  machine includes an annular support member (12) and a  fluid expandable annular tube element (16) having an upper  wall portion (26) and a lower wall portion (24).  the lower wall  portion of the tube element is movable radially away from  the upper wall portion upon expansion of the tube element  and is movable radially toward the upper wall portion upon  contraction of the tube element.  the upper wall portion  includes an annular peripheral surface which is bonded  along a portion of the width thereof to the support member  and the lower wall portion includes an annular outer  peripheral surface having a plurality of gripper means (36)  disposed in an annular array supported thereon which are  operable to engage and grip tread and a radial tread ply band  upon expansion of the tube element.  a plurality of ply bands  (46) are disposed in the lower wall portion of the tube element  adjacent the plurality of gripper means to increase the  rigidity of the lower wall portion to provide for uniform radial  movement of the lower wall portion and gripper means upon  expansion of the tube element to effect gripping of a radial  tread ply band thereby and to prevent collapse of the tube  element upon contraction.  the ply bands add strength to the  lower wall portion without increasing the stiffness of the side  wall portions of the tube element.
