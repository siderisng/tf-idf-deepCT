<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lavette for receiving lightweight machine weapons, with a toplafette (2) with reserves for releasably attaching the weapon (23) on a holder, with a sub-luffette (1) with a rotary ring (5) to attach to a vehicle is, so that the upperla fats (2) with the weapon pivotable about a horizontal weapon swivel axis (29) is rotatable about the vertical axis of the rotary ring (5), with the height and side direction lever (43) arranged below the rotary ring with the rotation ring (5) or the weapon holder are operatively connected, with a remote extraction for actuating the weapon offset and with a deflection mirror comprising visor in the direction (3), the insight (19) is located below the rotary of the rotation and its visor line with The pivoting of the weapon (23) is coupled about the weapon swing axis (29). In order to obtain a simplified vision device (3) with a large field of view, this is constructed as a rigid unit with fixed deflection mirrors (15, 16) and a pivotable to the horizontal weapon swing axis (29) parally Lele visor axis (13) pivotable and on a diaphragm ( 12) attached to the visor pivot axis (13) rotationally tread surface areas. With the diaphragm, another pivot axis (38) is rigidly connected to which a handlebar (39) is pivotable, the other end of which is hinged to the weapon holder (33). Visor axis (13), waf fench swivel axis (29), further pivot axis (36) and the axis (40) of the handlebar linkage form the vertices of a parallelogram.
