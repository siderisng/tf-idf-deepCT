<ABSTRACT>
a solid-state circuit breaker is provided with circuitry for  permitting off/on/reset operations actuated by a mechanical  toggle control switch as in the operation of a magnetic circuit  breaker.  a power continuity feature is provided for load  power by so locating the toggle control switch that it opens  all of the circuit, except the static power switch branch,  between the source and the load, to provide a high degree of  fail-safe protection for the apparatus.  the power continuity  feature includes means (40) for zero crossover synchroniza­ tion both upon power-up and power-down conditions.  a  circuit lockout feature (34) is used so that on power-up or  turn-on, operation is delayed until the occurrence of an  internal "power-ready" condition.  on power-down or turn-­ off there is means for circuit retention subsequent to switch  opening and internal power removal in order to accomplish  load turn-off at a desired zero crossover point of the load  power through the power switch.  a power supply (24) is  incorporated that does not require stepdown or isolation  transformers and improves capability for miniaturization of  the overall circuitry and enables design of the circuit for  operation at any of a wide range of frequencies.  a solid-state  circuit breaker for three phase operation is also provided.

ac solid-state circuit breaker this invention relates generally to solid-state circuit breakers for controlling the supply of power from an ac supply to a load and particularly to such circuit breakers that are suitable for applications in which size and weight must be minimized and reliability must be enhanced while retaining the functional advantages offered by conventional electromechanical apparatus. in u.s. patent 3,879,652, to billings, granted april 22, 1975, there is disclosed an ac solid-state power controller, the disclosure in which patent is incorporated herein by reference. such apparatus as disclosed in said u.s. patent is quite satisfactory for its intended purposes, and is generally referred to by the term "power controller" which term could also be applied generally to the present invention. however, it is preferred herein instead to refer to the present apparatus as a solid-state circuit breaker" to convey the suggestion that the apparatus described herein has capability for interruption in response to a manually actuated element or switch, as an electromechanical circuit breaker does, in addition to the internal power control functions which it may be additionally capable of conventional circuit breakers have an off/on/ reset toggle switch utilizing magnetic and thermally responsive elements, which is a desirable feature and affords flexibility and convenience in the testing, maintenance and use of the breaker. additionally, electromechanical breakers have the quality of power contact, meaning that the closed or "on" position provides direct conduction #of lower to the load with negligible impedance and upon interruption there is a clean break imposing an infinite impedance# in the load circuit. such apparatus is. also usually designed to be capable of inverse-time overload trip protection. also, conventional circuit breakers can readily be provided with means for status indication of the contacts. all these functions are- desirably to be achieved in a solid-state circuit breaker which avoids problems of mechanical wear, reliability, and bulk. among the features not provided by conventional type circuit breakers is a means for insuring occurrence of the closing or interruption function to synchronize with a predetermined point in the applied power wave for#m. such synchronism becomes an important objective in designing a solid-state circuit breaker because the power switch elements-, normally thyristors-, unlike mechanical contacts, are particularly dependent in their operation and performance on the applied wave shape. also, conventional circuit breakers inherently exhibit overload protection within too wide a tolerance range which is desirably to be made more precise. other features of conventional circuit breakers tending to make them less desirable in situations requiring high reliability is that they are affected by ambient temperature, dust, moisture, and the like, and exhibit relatively low physical strength and endurance to shock and vibration. described herein is a solid-state circuit breaker apparatus with the good qualities of electromechanical circuit b#reakers while markedly improving on other poorer qualities so that the apparatus is capable of performance with high reliability in a compact and low weight structure making it particularly suitable for use in aerospace, military and other applications where these
