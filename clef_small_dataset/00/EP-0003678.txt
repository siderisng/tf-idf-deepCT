<ABSTRACT>
a gear assembly: a gear assembly which is used  in a power assisted steering system of a vehicle.  the gear assembly comprises a piston (1) within a  cylinder (2), the piston (1) being axially displaceable in  response to an input shaft (4).  the piston (1) is axially  rotatable by means of a track (18) and track follower (19)  in response to axial displacement.  splines (40) on the  piston (1) intermesh with teeth (42a) of a take off part (42)  which is laterally spaced and in side by side relationship  with the piston.  by rotation of the piston (1) an output  shaft (44) of the take off part (42) is rotated.  in a modification  the take off part instead of being in side by side relationship  is an extension of the piston and the track is of  variable curved portions.
