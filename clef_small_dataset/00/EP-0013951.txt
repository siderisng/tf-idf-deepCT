<ABSTRACT>
building bricks for a refractory lining are positively locked to one another with the aid of projections (13) and recesses (16) on the upper side and the lower side, in order that they keep their position within the brick bond and the joints remain tight, even when the brick dimensions change as a result of the effects of temperature or the bricks tend to move in relation to one another.  a particularly compact brick is to be provided, which ensures better force transmission and smoothly running horizontal joints.  in this brick, the recesses (16), which are provided in the central part (11), and the projections (13) of the end parts (12) in each case extend only in the central width region of the brick cross-section, while in the adjoining edge regions (14) the upper side and lower side of the brick in each case run in a continuous plane.
