<ABSTRACT>
a workbench includes' a top structure (10) and a  supporting structure (20) for supporting the top structure  above the floor.  the top structure includes a three part vice,  one part being a first elongate vice member (32) and the  second and third parts (36, 38) together forming a second  elongate vice member (34) extending in side-by-side relationship  with the first elongate vice member, the two  elongate vice members having opposed clamping faces.  a  first vice operating arrangement (28) causes movement of  the clamping face of at least one vice member towards and  away from the clamping face of the other vice member.  a  second vice operating arrangement causes relative movement  of the second and third parts (36, 38) in a direction  parallel to the direction of elongation of the vice members to  permit clamping of objects between opposed further clamping  faces of the second and third parts (36, 38).
