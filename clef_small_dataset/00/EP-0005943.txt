<ABSTRACT>
a data transmission system to enable data to be  transmitted along a transmission path at a rate c greater  than the upper data rate limit a of the path.  a data  transmitter driven by an internal clock at c hertz transmits  data along the transmission path and at the same time also  transmits a derived clock signal at a frequency c/n hertz  where  c / n < a along the path.  at the receiver the data is  clocked into a series of data stores under the control of the  transmitted clock signal and is thereafter recombined into a  serial stream under the control of the clock signal driving the  receiver.
