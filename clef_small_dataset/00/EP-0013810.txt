<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus is provided for the manufacture  of dry spun explosive fusecord, the method comprising contin­ uously advancing a carrier tape in a horizontal linear parth,  partially convoluting the tape to form a longitudinal open  trough portion extending over a feed zone of said path, contin­ uously feeding a stream of explosive material into the trough  portion at a controlled rate appropriate to the formation of  the desired explosive core, said stream being elongated and  extending longitudinally over a portion of said feed zone, fur­ ther convoluting the loaded tape to form a closed tube sur­ rounding the explosive core and subsequently applying rein­ forcing materials around the closed tube.  the carrier tape is  preferably convoluted by carrying it through guides whilst the  tape is supported on an auxiliary transport tape of stronger  material.  helically spun layers of textile reinforcing material  are advantageously applied from supply reels mounted in line  co-axially with the path of the carrier tape, the fusecord pas­ sing through the centre of each textile supply reel.  the method permits higher production rates and more  uniform loading of the explosive core of the fusecord.
