<ABSTRACT>
an encapsulated hall effect device is constructed on a  thin substrate (20) with an aperture (25).  a semi-conductor  chip (30) having a plurality of connection leads (34,35) and  including a hall effect element having a sensing surface (38) is  disposed in registration with the aperture (25).  encapsulation  material (40) surrounds the chip (30) and aperture (25).  the  encapsulation material (40) comprises a nonmagnetic portion  (42) which surrounds the sensing surface (38) of the chip (30)  and a magnetically active portion (44) which surrounds the  surface of the chip (30) opposite the sensing surface (38), with  both portions (42,44) together fully enclosing the chip (30).
