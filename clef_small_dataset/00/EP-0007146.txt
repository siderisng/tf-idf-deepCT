<ABSTRACT>
three elongate members such as rods or tubes forming  mutually perpendicular uprights (2), transoms (1) and ledgers  (3) in a scaffolding structure and interconnected by engage­ ment of a bracket (6) carried at one end of a first (horizontal)  member (1) in a socket provided in a second (upright) member  (2), a third horizontal member (3) being engaged between the  said end and the second member and retained in position by a  wedge element (15).  the wedge element is jammed in posi­ tion by tightening a clamping nut (18).  the resulting intercon­ nection is easy to effect and makes use of standard pipes such  as scaffolding tubes.
