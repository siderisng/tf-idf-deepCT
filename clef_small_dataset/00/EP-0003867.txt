<ABSTRACT>
an am receiver for utilizing a broadcast signal of the  form (1 + l + r)cos(ωct + ⊘) separates the l and r signals  by utilizing phase detection and matrixing.  distortion is  either eliminated with non-linear amplification or reduced  with partial matrixing.  the receiver includes an rf stage (11)  and an if stage (12) for receiving the above signal where l  and r are information signals, ωct is the carrier frequency  and ø is arc tan (l - r) (1 + l + r).  the receiver also includes  a first circuit means (18, 20, 24, 30, 31, 33, 40) coupled to the  if stage (12) to provide a first intermediate signal related to  tan ø, a second circuit means (14) coupled to the if stage (12)  for providing a second intermediate signal proportional to  the amplitude modulation on the received signal, and matrixing  means (16) coupled to the first and second circuit means  (14, 18, 20, 24, 30, 31, 33, 40) to provide output signals substantially  proportional to l and r.
