<ABSTRACT>
an electroconductive polymer composition contains  from 90 to 99. 5% by weight of a water-soluble electrocon­ ductive polymer; sufficient amounts of a stabilizer to adjust  the ph to 8. 0 or more; and from 0. 5 to 10% by weight of the  polymer composition of a (mono or)bis-(fluorinated alkyl)-­ phosphate ester of the formula:   (cmf2m+1cnh2no)ypo(om)3-y   where m is an integer between 4 and 10, n is an integer  between 1 and 11, y is 1 or 2 and m is a water-solubilizing  cation; or of an ammonium bis-(n-ethyl-2-perfluoralkyl­ sulfonamide ethyl) phosphate containing not more than  15% ammonium mono(n-ethyl-2-perfluoroalkylsulfonamido­ ethyl) phosphate in which the alkyl group is more than 95%  c₈, the fluorine content is 50. 2% to 52. 8% as determined  a solids basis.

<DESCRIPTION>
use of fluorosurfactants in electroconductive coating compositions this invention relates to electroconductive polymer compositions of the type that may be applied to surface-sized and non-surfaced--sized paper raw stock. the present invention is based on the discovery that, by incorporating into a condactive polymer an effective quantity of certain fluorosurfactants and a stabilizer, the solvent holdout and tack properties can be improved, so that paper coated with the compositions will have solvent holdout, conductivity and tack properties that are acceptable as electroconductive base stocks for electrographic and electrophotographic papers. in general, electroconductive base sheets for use in the manufacture of electrographic and electrophotographic reproduction papers are prepared by applying to one or both surfaces of a suitable paper substrate (a publication grade paper oi basis weight in the range of 30 to 45 pounds per 3,000 square feet, i.e. o.ojj9 to 0.074 kg/m2) a resinous conductive layer to render the paper electroconductive. commonly the conductive layer comprises an electroconductive polymer either alone or more usually, formulated with a binder (normally a water-soluble, non-conductive, film-iorming polymer such ns a protein, starch, styrene-butadiene latices, a modified or converted starell, casein, polyvinylacetate, polyvinylalcohol, copolymer of ethylene and vinylacetate, and the like) and with a pigment (such as calcium carbonate, kaolin clay, titanium dioxide, alumina or a combination of these materials). in the electrostatic paper industry, such formulations including a conductive agent, a binder and a pigment are commonly ref erred to as coating formulations or compositions. the binders in conventional conductive coating formulations serve to make the paper less porous and more uniform, to improve the adherence of the conductive layer to the base paper and, importantly, to impart to the conductive layer the properties of a holdout or barrier coating to prevent solvents used in the later applied photosensitive or dielectric layers from penetrating into the conductivized paper. a separate nonconductive solvent holdout layer comprising one or a mixture of conventional binders is applied to the paper prior to the application oi the conductive layer in order to assist in achieving a solvent holdout effect. solvent holdout to toluene and, in some cases, paraffinic solvents is essential because the top side oi a conductive base paper comes into contact with toluene during the subsequent application of the photo-sensitive or dielectric coating which comprises dye-sensitized zinc oxide or dielectric resin dispersed in toluene and a binder. in some cases, the back of the zinc oxide or dielectric coated base stock (now referred to as finished electrofax or dielectric paper) comes into contact with kerosene during the copying process inside copy machines that use bwet" toners which are composed of carbon particles suspended in a solution of kerosene and binders. the usual type of electroconductive polymer in combination with the usual type of coating additives, such as the binders and pigments mentioned above, will not give acceptable solvent holdout when applied at commercially feasable coatweights of from 1 to 4 pounds of coating per 3;ooo square feet per paper surface where attempts are made to
