<ABSTRACT>
crystalline aluminosilicates containing an organic  nitrogen cation are prepared by mixing a source of silica,  a source of alumina, a source of alkali metal, water and  one or more substituted neopentyl amines having the for­ mula    wherein r² is h, oh or nh₂, and r¹ is a c₁ to c₆ alkyl group,  thereby maintaining the mixture under conditions of ele­ vated temperature and pressure, typically in the range from  80 to 210°c and 70 to 400 psig, for a time sufficient to  effect formation of the aluminosilicate, typically not less  than 4 hours.  the molar ratio of silica to alumina in the  initial mixture is suitably in the range from 10:1 to 150:1  and the amounts of alkali metal and neopentyl amine or  mixture thereof are suitable in the range from 50 to 0. 02  moles per mole equivalent of total silica and alumina in the  respective sources.  depending on the ratio of silica to alu­ mina in the initial mixture crystalline aluminosilicates hav­ ing a mordenite structure or a zsm-5 type zeolite structure  or mixtures thereof may be prepared.  mordenites having a  silica to alumina ratio greater than 10:1 and an alkali metal  content less than 0. 15% by weight can be prepared directly  by crystallisation without any post-crystallisation treatment.  the aluminosilicates are used as catalyst supports in  various organic conversion reactions.  catalytic composi­ tions are prepared therefrom by depositing thereon one or  more metal oxides.
