<ABSTRACT>
a self-adhesive ceramic or other rigid tile having on a face  thereof which is to be adhered to a surface a whole or partial,  dry coating of a hydraulically active tile composition comprising  a hydraulic material and a water soluble adhesive.  a  method for the preparation of these tiles comprises applying  to a face of a tile a paste comprising a dispersion in a liquid  medium of a hydraulic material, a water soluble adhesive,  and/or if necessary, a solvent-soluble adhesive, and drying  the tile face to remove the liquid medium.  on immersion or dipping of the tiles in water the tile  composition adsorbs enough water to be converted into a  paste having adequate adhesive properties for the tiles to be  fixed to a surface to be tired.
