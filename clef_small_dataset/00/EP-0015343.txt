<ABSTRACT>
there ist provided a high pass switched capacitor fil­ ter having low bandpass ripple.  the present filter does not  have peaking near its center frequency when sampled at  switching frequencies used in communication systems.   the high pass filter has three switched capacitor integra­ tors (10, 25, 40) providing a 3-pole chebyshev high pass  switched capacitor filter.  a fourth switched capacitor inte­ grator (50) is used to provide an output for the filter.  a  method of implementing the high pass filter from a set of  parameter requirements is also provided.  the capacitors  used in this filter are rations of each other and the filter  readily lends itself to being implemented as a monolithic  integrated circuit, paricularly as a cmos circuit.
