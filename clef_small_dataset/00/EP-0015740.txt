<ABSTRACT>
a conveyor roller comprises a roller tube (35) fitted with  end cap assemblies incorporating bearings (11) for rotatably  mounting the roller tube (35) on a fixed shaft (36).  each end  cap assembly comprises a rigid housing having a cylindrical  collar (13) adapted to be a push fit in an end of the roller tube  (35), the outer end of the collar (13) being spaced radially from  the housing.  the end cap assembly is secured in position by  swaging the end of the tube (35) so as to force the outer end of  the collar (13) radially inwards against the rigid housing.  the  collar (13) may be a close fit on the housing, or the housing  may be moulded in plastics material and one end of the collar  (13) embedded in the plastics during the moulding of the hous­ ing.  the outer end of the collar (13) has a flange (26) which  abuts the end of the roller tube (35).  the outer surface of the  housing is curved radially inwards in the direction of the free  end of the collar (13) to limit the deflection of the collar (13).   the separate collar can have a thickness adapted to any partic­ ular diameter of roller tube (35), and may be connected to the  housing by welding, adhesive or interengaging teeth or ribs to  prevent relative rotation therebetween.
