The movements of each actuating rod (9) are transmitted via Zah Nr√§der (6) and a connector (4, 5) to a player (1) above the game board (13). The connector (4, 5) is through the slot (12) in the game board (13) and carries a support piece (2) where the player (1) is held. The support plate has a recess (22), through which a lever (3) attached to one end on the shaft (8) extends, the other end at the movable arm or leg (11) of the player (1) attacks with which the ball over The game board (13) is pushed.
