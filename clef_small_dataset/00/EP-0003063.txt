<ABSTRACT>
for inserting a prefabricated pile into the ground, in which a shaft is formed in the ground by introducing a steel sheath into the ground, the ground beneath the pile is consolidated by pressing the pile down whilst bearing on the sheath to be held in the ground. 
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
method and device for inserting a pile into the ground the invention relates to a method of inserting a prefabricated pile into the ground, in which a shaft is formed in the ground by introducing a steel sheath into the ground, the prefabricated pile is slipped into the sheath and the sheath is removed from the shaft whilst leaving the pile in the ground. such a method is known. in the known method there is a risk that after the removal of the sheath the pile may subsequently sink too deeply into the ground due to lack of ground resistance. the invention has for its object to improve the support of the pile, whilst by means of a comparatively light and readily maniable device the pile can be rapidly inserted into the ground without the risk of destruction of the pile. in a method according to the invention the ground beneath the pile is consolidated by pressing down the pile, which sets off from the sheath to be held in the ground, the sheath being removed from the ground not until has the consolidation been achieved. the invention furthermore relates to and improves a device for inserting a prefabricated pile into the ground by using the method in accordance with the invention, said device comprising a tubular sheath and a displaceable guide frame having driving means for introducing the sheath into the ground. this device is characterized by setting-off means to be arranged between the pile and the sheath and by means for energizing said setting-off means in order to press down the pile during consolidation of the ground by setting off the pile against the sheath to be held in the ground and by means separated from the setting-off means for withdrawing the sheath from the ground. the invention provides furthermore a pile inserted into the ground by the method according to the invention, said pile being characterized in that the pile is fixed in place with respect to the pile foot without the interposition of concrete locally shed in shaft by means of undeformable, interengaging contact surfaces between the pile foot and the pile. the above-mentioned and further features of the invention will be explained in the following description with reference to drawings. the drawings show schematically in figures 1, 6, 10, 11 and 12 longitudinal sectional views of a sheath with a pile during the consolidation of the ground located beneath the pile, figures 3, 4, 5 and 8 longitudinal sectional views of the lower end of the sheath during the introduction thereof into the ground, figures 2, 7 and 9 longitudinal sectional views of the lower end of a pile inserted into the ground by using the method shown in figures 1, 6 and 8 respectively, figure 13 a plan view of a site during the insertion of piles into the ground, figure 14 on an enlarged scale a detail xiv of figure 13, figure 15 a control-system for the device illustrated in figure 14, figure
