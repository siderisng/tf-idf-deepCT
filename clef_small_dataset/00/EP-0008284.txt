<ABSTRACT>
1.  process of making of ornamental stones of concrete porelessly coated with an artificial resin characterized by the following steps partially known per se a) making a concrete mixture of cement and balast material, which mixture contains per part by volume cement at least seven, preferably seven to twelve parts by volume of balast material, whereby a mixture of 70-90, preferably 80 % of preferably twice washed quartz-sand of a particle size of 2 mm and 10 to 30, preferably 20 % fine-quartz-sand of a maximum particle size of 1 mm is preferably used as balast material, b) adding of water until the mixture is damp, c) shaping of the ornamental stone, d) setting the concrete for 20 to 30 days under moderated moistening and exclusion of direct sun-radiation, e) applying of an annealing powder of an artificial resin, for example a polyester-resin or an epoxy-resin or mixtures thereof onto the ornamental stone of concrete preferably electrostatically, and f) deposing the ornamental stone into a chamber preheated to 180 to 220 degrees c preferable to 190 to 200 degrees c for a time of 15 to 30, preferably 20 to 25 min for annealing the powder of the artificial resin to the end of achieving of poreless coating of the resin on the ornamental stone.
