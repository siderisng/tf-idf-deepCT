<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement for generating actuating movements on motor vehicle ventilation devices driven by electric motor, in particular on by lid-closable roof openings, the control movements are carried out automatically without access to the vehicle occupants during the journey, whereby the size of the ventilation opening can be controlled as a function of the driving speed.The arrangement provides that with a motor vehicle part (1a) rotating in the driving operation, whose speed of the driving speed is directly proportional, a generator (1b) is coupled from which a control signal is derived, with the aid of the actuator (36) for theVentilation device according to the driving speed, at a higher speed in the closing direction and at lower speed in the opening direction of the ventilation device, is switched on.
