<ABSTRACT>
 poly(aryloxyphosphazene) copolymers are prepared  having randomly repeating units represented by the formula:    wherein r and r¹ may be the same or different and are  selected from the group consisting of monovalent aryl radi­ cals and substituted aryl radicals having the structure:    wherein x is a substituent selected from the group consisting  of alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, aryloxy, amino and halogen substituted  on any sterically permissible position on the phenyl group;  and wherein the amount of cl present in the form of p-cl  bonds is from about 0. 4 percent to about 10 percent by weight  based upon the total weight of copolymer.  the copolymers may contain minor proportions of ran­ domly distributed units in addition to the repeating units  described above, these additional units containing reactive  sites enabling the properties of the copolymers to be modified  by crosslinking and/or curing.  the copolymers are elastomeric even in the absence of  low molecular weight polyphosphazene oils.  the copolymers  are curable by a variety of curing agents such as sulfur and  peroxides, and can also be cured by radiation and ultraviolet  light.  the copolymers may be utilized in various applications  such as foams and coatings, and are particularly suited for use  in wire coating formulations.
