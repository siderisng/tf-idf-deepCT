<ABSTRACT>
a digital multiplex type vehicle electrical switching sys­ tem includes a transmitter and a plurality of receivers, each  controlling a plurality of load devices (l₁. . . l₄).  the transmitter  produces a sequence of multibit digital words each including  a plurality an address code bits and a plurality of utilization  code bits.  each receiver recognises its own address code and  accepts the associated utilization code.  a command verifica­ tion logic circuit (58) is connected to recognise when the  utilisation codes accepted by the receiver in successive cycles  are identical.  a fail safe circuit (66) operates to cause all the  load devices (l₁ to l₄) to be driven to predetermined "safe"  condition in the event that the command verification logic  circuit fails to produce a "utilization code verified" signal  periodically.
