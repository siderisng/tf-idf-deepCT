<ABSTRACT>
1.  scaffolding elements (10, 11) such for instance as scaffolding frames (10) comprising each one two like parallel crosswise spaced and rigidly interconnected tube sections (19), both opposite ends (19', 19") of each tube section (19) forming a spigot portion (19') and a socket portion (19"), respectively, adapted to be connected through interfitted jointing to a socket portion (18, 19") and to a spigot portion (17, 19"), respectively, of another adjacent scaffolding element (11, 10), both tube sections (19) of each element (10) being arranged in head-to-foot relationship, so that the spigot portion (19') of the end of one tube be on a level with the socket portion (19") of the end of the other tube and conversely, characterized in that each spigot portion (19') is shaped through swaging to an outside diameter slightly less than the inside diameter of the socket portion (18, 19"), said socket portions (19") of said element (10) having each one at least one longitudinal groove (32) and a cross groove or circumferential groove (34), said spigot portions (19') of said element (10) having each one at least one longitudinal groove (27), said longitudinal grooves or cross grooves (27, 32, 34) being shaped through distortion for instance through swaging, rolling or stamping of said tube sections (19), so that the cross-sectional contour of the outer surface of a spigot portion (19') upon said jointing conforms with a relatively very small clearance to the cross-sectional contour of the inner surface of a socket portion (18, 19"), the end (29) of said spigot portion (19') abutting against said cross or circumferential groove (34) of said socket portion (18, 19") of said other adjacent scaffolding elements (10, 11) where as the end (35) of said socket portion (18, 19") abuts against a shoulder provided by said swaging of the spigot portion (19').
