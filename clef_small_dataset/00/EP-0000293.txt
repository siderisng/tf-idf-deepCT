<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for anaerobic digestion of biodegradable  waste material comprises a closed substantially vertical  cylindrical tank (1) containing a mixing assembly (4) which  comprises an annular gas-holding member (8) connected to  a gas distribution arm (9) extending substantially radially  outwardly from the annular gas-holding member (8) towards  the periphery of the tank (1).  both the annular gas-holding  member (8) and the gas distribution arm (9) have open lower  surfaces, and the gas distribution arm (9) has exhaust apertures  (10) spaced along the length of the arm (9) for delivering  gas from the gas-holding member (8) at different radial  distances along the arm (9).  the mixing assembly (4) is  rotatable about the central axis of the tank (1), with which  axis the annular gas-holding member (8) is concentrically  located, and gas is supplied to the gas-holding member (8)  by a gas delivery duct (12) having an outlet (13) disposed  beneath a part of the annulus defined by the annular gas-holding  member (8).
