there is described a coded glass container wherein the  code comprises markings arranged on the base of the conÂ­ tainer along the circumferences of at least two concentric  circles.  the circles may be of infinite radius.

<DESCRIPTION>
"container coding". this invention relates to the coding of containers, and especially to the coding of glass containers such as bottles and jars. the manufacture of glass containers is a highly automated procedure. molten glass is fed from a furnace to one or more moulding machines, in which the glass, in the form of individual gobs, is pressed and/or blown into shape in mould cavities. several different types of glass making machine are known, and they operate on the multi-mould cavity principle. in other words, it is normal for a machine to comprise at least eight moulds, and many machines have twleve, sixteen or even twenty-four moulds which are simultaneously operating to produce moulded glass containers. each individual mould will produce some thousands of containers per day, if the machine is operated continuously. it sometimes happens that the glasslsare produced in glass-making machines is defective for one reason or another, and in some cases the defects are so bad that the ware cannot be supplied for the customers particular end use. it will normally be the case that the defective ware is produced in one, or perhaps two, moulds only, and it is therefore necessary that those moulds, and the ware produced by them, should be easily and readily identifiable so that the ware that is defective can be located and discarded. it is also a requirement of packages nowadays that, regardless of whether the glassware is defective, each article of glassware, e.g. each glass bottle or jar, should be readily identifiable as to its place of manufacture, the mould in which it was manufactured, and possibly even the date of manufacture. for these reasons it has recently become necessary to provide glassware with distinguishing markings, or codes, by which their precise location of manufacture may be identified. the present invention is concerned with the provision of a coding system for glass bottles and other glass containers. according to the invention there is provided a coded glass container wherein the code comprises markings arranged on the base of the container along the circumferences of at least two concentric circles. the invention also provides glass-making moulds which are configured to provide the glassware manufactured in them with the markings described immediately above. the coding system of the invention may be applied to glass containers of various shapes. thus, it may be applied to bottles having round bases, in which case the concentric circles will have a finite radius, suitably only slightly smaller than the radius of the base (i.e. the markings are sited adjacent the periphery of the base); or it may be applied to bottles having bases which are other than round, e.g. rectangular, in which case the concentric circles may have an infinite radius and the two sets of markings will occupy positions on parallel straight lines, preferably along one or both edges of the base of the container. for containers whose bases are neither round nor rectangular it will be preferable to adopt a system of parallel straight

claims:   1. a coded glass container wherein the code comprises markings arranged on the base of the container along the circumferences of at least two concentric circles.   2. a coded glass container wherein the code comprises markings arranged on the base of the container along the circumferences of two concentric circles.   3. a container as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein at least some of the markings are constituted by stippling.   4. a container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said concentric circles are of infinite radius.   5. a container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the code appears twice on the bottom of the contrainer.      6. a coded glass container, substantially as herein-    before described with reference to figure 1 or figure 2 of the accompanying drawings.
