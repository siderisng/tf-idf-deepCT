<ABSTRACT>
a roller assembly includes a body (10) with a cylindri­ cal bore (12) and rollers (14) extending lengthwise inside  the bore.  the rollers abut one another to form a closed cir­ cle of rollers.  a folded spring (18) extends diametrically across the  circle of rollers with diametrically opposite ends (20,22)  pressing between two adjoining rollers to wedge these rol­ lers apart circumferentially and thus to press all the rollers  against the surface (16) of the bore (12) in a "keystoning"  effect with sufficient force to prevent axial movement of  the rollers and to radially retain the rollers in the body.  the  spring is arranged to be subsequently pushed axially from  the body.
