<ABSTRACT>
1.  lying or sitting device for a patient with a rotatably arranged paper dispensing roller (1) in the vicinity of one end of its lying or sitting surface (4) and with a drivable take-up device (2) in the vicinity of the other end of the lying or sitting surface (4) with which a fresh section of paper is drawn over the lying or sitting surface (4) from the dispensing roller (1) whilst simultaneously taking up the used section of paper, characterised in that the take-up device (2) comprises a rotatably mounted slotted spindle (21) in whose slot (22) the end of the sheet of paper to be taken up from the dispensing roller (11) may be inserted, that the slot (22) extends to one end of the spindle (21) thus forming two prongs (23, 24) and that a closure disc (25) is attachable to the free ends of the prongs (23, 24) which has a block (26a) engaging between the prongs (23, 24) which holds the prongs (23, 24) in the spread state, so that when separating the closure disc (25) from the spindle (21) the prongs (23, 24) move together and thus an easy withdrawal of the spindle (21) from the waste paper roller is ensured.
