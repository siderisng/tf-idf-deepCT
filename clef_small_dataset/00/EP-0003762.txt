<ABSTRACT>
a fire detector with a monitor circuit having an oscillating  circuit (1), a sampling pulse generating circuit (2) for  generating a sampling pulse (p2) on the basis of an oscillating  output pulse (p1) of said oscillating circuit (1), a sensing  portion (3) for producing a fire sensing signal (p3) at least at  the time that said sampling pulse (p2) is transmitted, a judging  circuit (4) having a pulse circuit means for producing an  elongated judging output signal (p4) with a longer pulse  duration than that of said oscillating output pulse (p1) from  said oscillating circuit (1) when said sensing signal (p3) from  said sensing portion (3) exceeds a predetermined level (rl),  a fire alarm trigger signal transmitting circuit (5) for generating  a fire alarm trigger signal (p5) on the basis of said judging  signal (p4) from said judging circuit (4) and for transmitting  said fire alarm trigger signal (p5) through a signal line (10) to  a fire alarm controller (11), and a monitor circuit (6,7) which  receives said oscillating output pulse (p1) said sampling  pulse (p2) and said elongated judging output signal (p4), and  which produces at a monitor output terminal (9) of said  monitor circuit (6,7) no output signal (pml) when no output  pulse is produced from said oscillating circuit (1), produces  at said monitor output terminal (9) a signal (pm2) with the  same waveform as that of said sampling pulse (p2) when  said sensing portion (3) does not sense fire, and produces at  said monitor output terminal (9) a signal (pm3) with the same  waveform as that of said oscillating output pulse (p1) when  said sensing portion (3) senses fire under a condition that  said oscillating circuit (1) generates said oscillating output  pulse (p1).  the three operating conditions can be monitored by  applying the monitor output (pm) from said monitor circuit  (6, 7) to a state discrimination unit (8) such as a monitor lamp  or synchroscope and accordingly monitoring operation is  completed within a short time.
