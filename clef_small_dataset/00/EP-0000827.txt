<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for the production of mixtures, dispersions  and the like.  in apparatus for mixing finely divided materials such as  powders in a liquid, for example in the production of paints,  by means of a rotary agitator (14) which is vertically movable,  the vertical position of the agitator (14) is controlled in dependence  upon the noise level emitted by the agitated contents of  the pot (10).  in this way, the problems arising out of manual  control of the vertical position of the agitator (14) or the use of  mechanical floats or electrical probes are avoided.
