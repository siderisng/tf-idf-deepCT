<ABSTRACT>
chuck for lathes, having chuck jaws (2) consisting of an axially front jaw part (2a) and an axially rear jaw part (2b) which are each guided independently in a radially adjustable manner in the chuck body (1).  the rear jaw part (2b) is in engagement on the one hand with a drive member (4) for the jaw adjustment and on the other hand with the front jaw part (2a) through a coupling piece (16) which can be actuated from outside, is guided in the rear jaw part (2b) and, in the coupled state, engages in a tooth system (18a) which extends radially along the rear side of the front jaw part (2a).  to change the chucking diameter, it is therefore sufficient to adjust the front jaw part (2a) relative to the rear jaw part (2b).  the front jaw part (2a) therefore no longer needs to be set up for the radial adjustment of false jaws (40) attached, for example, to it.  nonetheless, so that false jaws (40) designed for such an adjustment, that is, false jaws (40) provided with a radially longitudinally running guide groove (41) for sliding blocks and with axial through bores (42) for fastening screws (43) holding the sliding blocks, can be attached to the front jaw part (2a) without having to provide there a t-slot or cross slot otherwise serving to accommodate the sliding blocks, the front jaw part (2a) merely has on its front side a flat guide groove (44) opposite the guide groove (41) of the false jaw (40), a sharp-toothed bearing surface (45) for the false jaw (40) and tapped holes (46) for the fastening screws (43).  inserted in the longitudinal channel formed by both guide grooves (41, 44) is a strip (47) which orientates the false jaw (40) on the front jaw part (2a).  <image>
