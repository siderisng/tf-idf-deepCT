<ABSTRACT>
a power transmission has a continuously variable gear  ratio, the torque being transmitted by friction between  balls (16, 17) and runways (14, 15, 18, 19, 29, 31, 36, 38).   the balls and runways are divided into two groups, each  group comprising a set of balls (e. g.  16) which roll on four  runways (e. g.  14, 18, 36, 38), two of the runways (36, 38)  being stationary or intercoupled to rotate with the same  angular velocity, and the other two runways (14, 18) being  coupled to the driving and the driven shaft respectively.   the two groups are coupled in parallel, each transmitting  torque from the driving shaft to the driven shaft.  at least two runways in each group are axially displaceable  to vary the gear ratio.  the cross-sectional  shapes of the runways are designed in accordance with  certain criteria in order to ensure that contact between all  the balls and runways is maintained during this displacement.
