<ABSTRACT>
1.  composite profiled bar, especially for window wing frames and casements or facades having an internal and an external partially profiled bar (17, 18), these two being connected with each other by spaced connecting elements made of a thermo-insulating material, these connecting elements being formed as two web-formed intermediate members (1, 2) which, hooked in grooves of the partially profiled bars (17, 18), are pushed apart from each other by at least one wedge-shaped member (3) interposed between them and are clamped in the grooves of the partially profiled bars, the thermo-insulating air chambers of said composite profiled bar being covered appropriately by stripes or bands, characterized in that, in the cross-section of the composite profiled bar, the intermediate members (1, 2) and the wedge-shaped member (3) are formed as a step wedge having at least one wedge step (9'), the latter scending obliquely in the longitudinal views of the intermediate members (1, 2) and the wedge-shaped member (3) in order to permit the clamping of the connecting elements in the grooves of the partially profiled bars (17, 18) by displacing the wedge-shaped member (3) along the wedge step.
