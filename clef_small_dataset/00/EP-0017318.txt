<ABSTRACT>
the casing (12a) of a hand-held instrument (12) provides  a contact surface for a capacitive switching circuit for  energizing a controlled device (63).  the switching circuit and  device are remote from the contact area.  the switching  circuit includes an input circuit (80) incorporating the body  capacitance (cb) and a variable capacitor (81) which is  adjusted to balance the circuit in the presence of only stray  capacitance (ce) without body capacitance so that the  switching circuit remains unactuated.  the addition of body  capacitance will actuate the switching circuit.  in the illusÂ­ trated embodiment, the input circuit (80) is energized by a  periodic signal.  an output signal is coupled from the  switching circuit to the controlled device through a delay off  circuit (88) which has a delay time longer than the period of  the periodic signal so that if contact with the instrument is  lost momentarily, there is no interruption in the controlled  function.  this is particularly advantageous in the case of a  medical device or dental handpiece where light from a high  intensity source is coupled back to the instrument for  illuminating the work area.

<DESCRIPTION>
capacitive switching circuit for energizing remote controlled device background and summary the present invention relates, in general, to capacitive switches. such devices are known in the art. in general, a capacitive switch is responsive to contact by the skin of a person or animal for switching an electrical circuit. such switches are in common use in elevators, for example. in most cases where a capacitive switch is used, the switching circuit may be located immediately adjacent any contact or sensor area (that is, the area which, if touched, will add body capacitance to a circuit and cause it to generate a control signal). however, a special problem is presented in the case of hand-held instruments, such as are in common use in the medical and dental fields. that is, in the case of a dental handpiece (or medical instrument, tool or probe), it is highly desirable to avoid having any voltage present in the handpiece which, if a short occurred, could cause a shock in the patient. further, most dental handpieces or medical instruments are highly compact to begin with, and the addition of any circuitry to the instrument could only add bulk to the design and reduce mobility. still further, in the case of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable to incorporate the controlled function into a dental handpiece as an option to be selected by the practitioner. that is to say, the illustrated embodiment includes a capacitive switching circuit which cooperates with a dental handpiece, the casing of the handpiece serving as the contact or sensor area which, if touched by a person, will actuate the capacitive switch. the capacitive switch, in turn, turns on a high intensity light source, the output of which is coupled through a fiber optic bundle back to the handpiece to illuminate the work area of the dentist. the dental handpiece is coupled to a console or the like through a conventional umbilical cord, and the high intensity light source is located at the console. since it is desirable not to have any voltage present in the handpiece which could cause a shock to the patient, the control circuitry is also located in the console, and this requires that the contact area of the handpiece be connected to the remote switching circuit by means of an electrical conductor, which is referred to as a capacitive cable. since it is desirable to provide umbilical cords of different lengths, both to accommodate an individual dentist's needs and to use the system for retrofitting dental consoles, the length of the capacitive cable may vary. adding to this variable is the effect on the stray capacitance of the cable and the body capacitance of the dentist due to environmental parameters, such as the type of floor covering, the relative humidity of the office, and so on. the capacitive switching circuit of the present invention incorporates the stray capacitances with an adjustable capacitance in an input circuit. the variable capacitance enables one to "tune"
