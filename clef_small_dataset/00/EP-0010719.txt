<ABSTRACT>
In a stroke tilting device or tilting device for emptying containers of different sizes, especially for emptying waste containers Different size in collection containers of refuse vehicles are two single-stroke tilting devices or single-tilted directions (20a and 20b ) The same type side by side such that smaller containers for emptying each only detected by one of the two single-stroke tilting reserves or single-tilt devices and larger containers for emptying simultaneously from both single-hub tilt devices or single tilt devices can be taken. The two single-stroke tilting devices (20a, 20b) or single tilting devices are also permitted in addition to their same design with the same, especially equal to large-lined pressure medium engines (23, 34). These pressure medium engines are connected to two equal pressure medium circuits (A, B). These pressure medium circles (A, B) each contain a control valve (37a, 37b) adapted for zero position, working stroke and return stroke) and are at their pressure mintteline tions (54a) extending from these control valves (37a, 37b) to the pressure medium motors (23, 34). 54b) Connected to each other via a shut-off and switching valve (38) in order to select them with each other by opening this from the locking and switching valve (38) with each other parall.
