<ABSTRACT>
known electrolysis cells used for producing chlorine for sanitising and sterilisation purposes deteriorate due to accummulation of scale on the electrodes thereof.  this problem is solved by an improved cell (10) comprising an outer electrode (12) having an in-facing surface (14) which defines a first cylindrical surface (16), and an inner, generally coaxial electrode (34) having an out-facing surface (38) which defines a second cylindrical surface (40).  the second cylindrical surface (40) lies radially inward of the first cylindrical surface (16).  the outer and inner electrodes (12 and 34) are longitudinally coextensive for at least a substantial portion thereof.  the inner and outer electrodes (12 and 34) are rotable relative to one another.  an abrading structure (98) is mounted to one of the electrodes (34) with an abrasive portion (100) thereof in abrasive contact with the other of the electrodes (12).  the abrading structure (98) is electrically insulated from at least one of the electrodes.  the electrodes (12 and 34) are supported in electrically insulating relation to one another within a cell cavity (36).
