<ABSTRACT>
in a photographic camera (10) having a hinged cover (20) serving as handle, a closeup attachment (30) with an objective lens (40) and an optical finder attachment element (41) is designed as a flat support plate and is disposed between the front (11) of the camera and the inner surface of a side wall (21) of the cover.  in this case, the cover and the closeup attachment are mounted to be pivotable about a common axis (26).  a leaf spring (35) prestresses the closeup attachment against the front of the camera, so that in its position of use the attachment is supported on the front of the camera and is held by means of locking means (25, 37).  in order to remove the closeup attachment which is situated in front of the exposure objective, the cover is closed.  in this case, an abutment nose (32) of the closeup attachment is resiliently supported on an abutment rib formed on the cover, and when the cover is opened the closeup attachment is entrained and held in the cover in consequence of the frictional connection between the abutment nose and the abutment rib.  <image>
