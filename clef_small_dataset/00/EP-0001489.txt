<ABSTRACT>
a method of preparing a stable dispersion in an aqueous  medium of particles of polymer in which stabilisation  of the particles against flocculation is effected by a steric  mechanism.  the method comprises (i) forming a sterically  stabilised dispersion in a non-aqueous liquid of a first polymer  insoluble both in the non-aqueous liquid and in water;  (ii) polymerising monomer in the same non-aqueous liquid  in the presence of the particles of the first polymer and of  a steric stabiliser, so as to form second polymer which is  soluble in the chosen aqueous medium; (iii) transferring  the resulting particles to the aqueous medium.  there may  be prepared in this way aqueous dispersions of polymers  incorporating units of water-soluble monomers, which are  difficult to make by known aqueous emulsion polymerisation  techniques.
