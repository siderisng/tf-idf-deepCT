<DESCRIPTION>
perfluoroalkylalkylenemercapto group containing non-ionic surfactants, process for their manufacture and their use. the instant invention relates to novel fluorinated non-ionic surfactants of the general formula emi1.1 wherein rf is perfluoroalkyl of 4 to 20 carbon atoms, or perfluoro alkoxyperfluoroalkyl of 4 to 20 carbon atoms, a is straight or branched chain alkyl of 1 to 10 carbon atoms which is unsubstituted or is substituted by halogen, preferably by chloro or fluoro, n is 1 to 50, r1 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and r2 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. preferably, rf is perfluoroalkyl of 4 to 16, preferably 4 to 14 carbon atoms or said perfluoroalkyl substituted by perfluoroalkoxy of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, a is unsubstituted alkylene of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably ethylene, n is 5 to 25, r1 is hydrogen or methyl, r2 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl and n is 5 to 50. where n is less than 5, the resulting-compounds have little water solubility. however, such compounds are useful as surfactants in non-aqueous systems, as mold release agents in the plastics and silicone industry, as well as grease and oil repellants for paper. those compounds wherein r1 is predominately lower alkyl are likewise characterized by their limited water solubility and likewise possess utility as surfactants in non aqueous systems, as mold release agents and as grease and oil repellants for paper and the like. preferred compounds are those wherein r is at least predominately hydrogen, r2 is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and n is 5 to 50, preferably 5 to 25. such compounds are essentially water soluble. such water soluble compounds are valuable aqueous surfactants and are useful industry wetting agents. thus, they are useful wetting agents for biocides, cleaming compositions and detergents, as rinseaids for cars, dishes an the like, as emulsifiers, and as levelling agents in the dye and pigment industry. the compounds of t4e instant invention are easily prepared by any one of a number ef n woes. the compounds can 4e prepared conveniently by reacting an alkoxylated compound of wee formula emi3.1 with epichlorohydrin in bulk or in a common dry and aprotic solvent, including ketones, such as acetone gr methyl ethyl ketone; ethers; such as diethylether, ethylenglycol-dimethylether or tetrahydrofuran; esters such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyleneglycol acetate; and amides, such as dimethylformamide or n-methyl pyrrolidone. a lewis acid catalyst, such as boron trifluoride (usually in the form of the diethyl ether complex tberof) or aluminium chloride, is used to promote the formation of the halohydrin intermediate. if the reaction is run in the absence of a solvent, it is advantageously run at a temperature above the melting point of the alkoxylated compound with boron trifluoride-etherate. the reaction is ordinarily exothermic. it is generally not necessary te isolate the halohydrin intermediate, and the next rection can be carried out in the same vessel. the halohydrin intermediate has
