<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure relates to a tire, a rim and a combina­ tion thereof that yields improved stability characteristics  when the tire is run flat.  the combination of this invention  yields a structure wherein the tire will operate normally  under normal conditions of load and pressure and will oper­ ate with the load equally distributed on each sidewall of the  tire during run fiat operation.  in this invention, the tire has  an asymmetric sidewall (17) construction resulting from the  inclusion of rubber inserts in its sidewalls of different bulk  (13, 14) and the rim has axially outward extending rim flange  extensions (5) which are angled in relation to the axis of  rotation of the rim.  the extensions are angled in opposite  directions.  the proper combination of these features com­ pensates for the camber that the tire is subjected to when it  is run flat.
