<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for measuring the colour of a product and  method of calibrating same is used for colour grading of  products such as fruits, vegetables and food products  being processed.  the apparatus employs a light source  (15) for illuminating the product and means (18) for detect­ ing light reflected from the product to provide a signal  that is a measure of the colour of the product.  for calibra­ tion, a target (35) of known colour is moved in front of the  light source and the signal resulting from the light  reflected by the target is compared with a reference signal  to generate a modifying signal.  means (36) are provided  for automatic calibration of the apparatus whereby this  modifying signal is stored and thereafter used to adjust  all subsequent readout signals.
