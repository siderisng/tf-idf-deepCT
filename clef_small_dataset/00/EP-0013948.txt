<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tripod for optical devices, in particular cameras, in which one in its length different spacer (9) at one end a fastening direction head (6) and at its other end by means of support elements (12, 13, 14) mounted, From a rest position into a suitable position spreadable legs (15, 16, 17). In order to achieve in such a tripod that it can be used as well fully as a shoulder stand and as a table stand, it is proposed, the carriers (12, 13, 14) for at least two of the legs (15, 16, 17) is thus the spacer (9) rotatably rotatable that the legs for forming a table stand in a first utility layer, in which they are arranged in the circumferential direction approximately at the same angular distance from each other, and to form a shoulder stand in a second current position in which they are covered or antigen system of at least two legs are arranged diametrically against overlying, can be adjusted.
