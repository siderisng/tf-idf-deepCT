<ABSTRACT>
in an apparatus for casting metal between a pair of  heat-conductive belts (21) an array of closely spaced  hexagonal-headed (50) support members are arranged  behind each belt at the mould space.  each support member  includes a restricted axial coolant jet passage and a film of  coolant is maintained between each head and the adjacent  belt, which is pulled against the support heads by maintain­ ing subatmospheric pressure conditions in the region of the  supports.  each support member is slidably mounted in a  base and is forced towards the belt by a spring but a stop  retains each support when the belt is removed.  the close  spacing of the hexagonal heads prevent their rotation in rela­ tion to each other but an individual support can be released  by depressing the support head out of the plane of adjacent  support heads and rotating the support through 60° to dis­ engage it from its stop.  the support can then be withdrawn  axially.
