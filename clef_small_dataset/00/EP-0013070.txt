<ABSTRACT>
a video record system includes a record disk 12 and a  read/write head 19.  a signal to be recorded is received on line  15 and processed by a converter26 before being passed to the  read/write head 19.  a signal read from the disk 12 by the  read/write head 19 is passed through a converter 30 and a  digital signal processor 32 to a television 14.  in this video record system the length of a mark along a  record track 20 on the disk 12 represents a four bit binary  storage code block and the player/recorder system operates  in eight-bit system code blocks.  thus, two marks on the disk  represent a single system code block.  the bits of the system  code block are assigned to bit positions of the storage code  blocks in such a way that there is a reduction in the affect in the  associated system of errors in initially writing or subsequently  reading a mark.  the increments of mark length are also made  non-constant to reduce the effect in the associated system of  errors in mark length.
