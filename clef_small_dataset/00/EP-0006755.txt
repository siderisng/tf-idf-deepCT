<ABSTRACT>
a drip irrigation system includes a flow control valve  (10) having an inlet opening (16) which constricts in re足 sponse to pressure increases to provide a uniform flow  despite pressure variations.  the inlet opening (16) of the  valve has a rectangularly cross-sectioned central section  and end sections which are non-rectangular, such as trian足 gular or semi-circular, in cross-section.  during normal flow  conditions the rectangular central section of the inlet open足 ing is pressed closed and irrigation liquid flows at a con足 stant rate through the two end sections.
