<ABSTRACT>
a female part (8) of the terminal has a wire receiving  first bore (22) with an eccentric counterbore (24) in which  is a plug (40) having a wire receiving second bore (42)  aligned with the first bore (22) and being eccentric with  respect to the axis of the plug (40).  the plug (40) is rotaÂ­ table in the counterbore (24), to an extent limited by stop  surfaces (36 and 52), so that a wire when received in the  bores (22 and 42) is constricted.  a body (38) projects from  the counterbore (24) in order to simpify the manufacture of the terminal and  to adapt it for use with aluminium wire, the plug (40) is  rigidly connected to the body (38), the stop surfaces (36  and 52) being external surfaces of the female part (8) and  the body (38) and being so relatively positioned that during  the relative rotation, substantial torsional shearing forces  are applied to the wire.
