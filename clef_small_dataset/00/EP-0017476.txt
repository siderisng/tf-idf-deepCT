<ABSTRACT>
an electrical storage heater comprising a heat store (10),  electrical heating means (10a), 10b) for heating same, means  for providing a flow of air (13) into contact with the heat store  (10) and thereafter into a space or place to be heated, and a  flow control means (14, 114, 214) for controlling the flow of  such air, wherein the control means (14, 114, 214) is operated  by first thermo-motive means such as a bimetal strip (23) and  also by a second thermo-motive means such as a hydraulic  device (34, 35, 32, 134, 135, 132, 234, 235) acting jointly by  way of a rocking arm (22, 122, 222) on a flap element (17, 117,  217) powered by available heat sources such as the store (10)  and air in the space or place to be heated to eliminate  consumption of electrical current during on-peak periods.
