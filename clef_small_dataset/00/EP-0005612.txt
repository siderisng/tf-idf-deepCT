<ABSTRACT>
an endoprosthetic knee joint device as femoral (10) and  tibial (20) components respectively adapted for connection  to the femur and tibia, and respective bearing surfaces for  mutual articulatory engagement to simulate natural joint  movements.  it is now proposed that the femoral component  has two transversely spaced spockets (15) as bearing  surfaces, and that the tibial component has two upstanding  ball parts (28) for respective articulation in the sockets.  the  ball parts can be separable, by the provision of stems (31)  engageable in apertures (30) in the base part.  preferably, the  sockets are enlarged relative to the balls to allow mutual  rotation about the axis of the leg.  also, the sockets and balls  can be of different material from their respective base parts,  the latter suitably being of metal.
