<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to new tetrapeptide hydrazide derivatives which have analgesic activity. hushes et al isolated from the brain of a pig a couple of pentapeptides, generically called enkephalin, which give morphinomimetic activity on intracerebral administration, and identified them to be h-tyr -gly-gly-phe-met-oh and h tyr-gly-gly-phe-leu-oh, respectively (nature 258, 577 p (1975)). although these substances display a morphinemimetic action when directly administered by the intracerebral route, they do not have an analgesic action on intravenous administration. r-endorphin, which is apparently derived from the carboxyl terminal of -lipotropin, when intravenously administered produces profound analgesic effects but since it is a polypeptide consisting of 31 amino acid residues, it is extremely difficult to produce it by an organic chemical process and, therefore, to make it available as a medicinal product on a commercial scale. the investigation made for commercially advantageous compounds which would be stable and capable of producing an adequate relief of pain on intravenous or subcutaneous administration led us to the finding that certain tetrapeptide derivatives are suitable for the abovestated purpose. the finding was followed by further research which has resulted in this present invention this invention is directed to: (1) a tetrapeptide hydrazide derivative, inclusive of a pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, which has the general formula (i): emi2.1 (wherein 21 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; r2 is hydrogen or the side chain of a r-a-amino acid; r3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; r4 is hydrogen, or a saturated or unsaturated and straight or branched lower aliphatic acyl group which may optionally. be substituted by hydroxy, amino, lower alkoxy, halogen, oxo, lower alkylthio or lower alkylthiooxide7 (2) a method of producing a tetrapeptide hydrazide derivative of general formula (i) characterized by deprotecting a compound of general formula (ii): emi2.2 (wherein r1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; r2 is hydrogen or the side chain of a d-a-amino acid which may optionally be protected; f, is hydrogen or lower alkyl; r4 is hydrogen, or a saturated or unsaturated and straight or branched lower aliphatic acyl group which may optionally be substituted by hydroxy, amino lower alkoxy halogen, oxo, lower alkylthio or lower alkylthiooxide and which may be protected; y1 is a protective group; y2 and yx, respectively mean hydrogen or a protective group). in this specification, amino acids and peptides are designated either by the abbreviations commonly used in the art or by those adopted by the committee on chemical nomenclature of iupac-iub. some of such abbreviations are as follows ala : alanine gly : glycine leu : leucine phe : phenylalanine methe : n-methyl-phenylalanine tyr : tyrosine metyr : n-methyl-tyrosine gln : glutamine thr : threonine ser : serine nva : norvaline met(o) : methionine sulfoxide met(o2) : methionine sulfone lys : lysine his : histidine glu : glutamic acid in the following description, the compounds repeatedly referred to are designated by the following abbreviations dcc : n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide honb : n-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide onb : honb ester z : benzyloicycarbonyl oet : ethyl ester onp : p-nitrophenyl ester frds :
