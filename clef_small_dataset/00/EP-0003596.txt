<ABSTRACT>
1.  a disc-shaped support for cam elements (9 ; 38) for acting on a movable element (26 ; 42) with a hub (1) and a disc (3) mounted on this perpendicular to its axis, which at least substantially rod-shaped cam elements (9 ; 38) with a rectangular cross-section and an extension (22) and with recesses disposed close to the periphery of the disc (3) in radial formation in uniform distribution corresponding to the n indexing steps of a cyclically periodic switching program, in which recesses the cam elements (9 ; 38) are pivotally guided, characterized in that the hub (1) carries, with axial spacing from the disc (3), an annular beaded edge (11), the cross-section of which is more than half circular in an axial sectional plane containing the axis (2a) of the hub, that the extension (22) of the cam elements (9 ; 38) is constructed as a bearing position (21) similar to a bearing bush in the form of an aperture which is circular over more than 180 degrees in the axial sectional plane and the diameter of which is at least substantially equal to that of the annular beaded edge (11) so that the cam elements (9 ; 38), applied to this, are pivotable about this beaded edge (11) in the axial sectional plane, and that the restoring force (25 ; 41) of the movable elements (26 ; 42) is directed at right angles to its cross-section and within this at least substantially towards the bearing position (21) and that the cam element (9 ; 38) comprises, at its side remote from the bearing position (21), as an arm, a transverse member (23, 40) with a contact surface (33) which, in the deflected position of the cam element (9 ; 38) is perpendicular to the direction of the restoring force (25 ; 41) (figure 1.  figure 4).
