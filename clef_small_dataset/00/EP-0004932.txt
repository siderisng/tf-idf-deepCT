<ABSTRACT>
With this opening device is created in preferably an end wall of a disposable packaging container, a lockable outlet opening after the first time opening. After a laid on the end wall loosely connected web material stripes partially firmly firmly connected to their surface, within the strip area connected to the end wall surface by a outline adjustment or outline weakness, a disengaging portion is set, which held on the occasion of the punching or outline weakening operation in its original position in the end wall becomes. After the punching or outline weakening process, the second, not already connected to the end wall region of the web material strip is returned by 180 ° congruent over the formed strip area and the expansion opening area. By attaching connection zones in the second strip area, this part is connected to a certain portion of the end wall material within the expansion opening, and the other out of this opening and around them with the container end wall. This creates primarily a hermetically sealing opposing device on the packaging container. A tearing of the second-mentioned strip area is exposed with simultaneous removal of the predetermined end wall material the expansion opening. After removing the desired quantum of the contents of the container, the second-mentioned strip area together with the end wall material adhering thereto is folded back on or into the outlet opening, wherein by snap engagement between the edges of the predetermined end wall material and the opening edge again no longer hermetically closing, but mechanical Adhesive opening closure results.
