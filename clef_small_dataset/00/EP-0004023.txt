<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a hinged connection for opening doors, flaps or the like.  in a hinged connection of this type, the hinge parts are fastened both to the carcase and to the door by means of screw-on plates (15, 19), the fastening bores of which lie in a connecting line aligned parallel to the pivot pins (12) and are coordinated with the hole spacing of series of holes made in the door, flap or the like and the cupboard walls.  it is thus possible also to connect doors, flaps or the like and carcase walls (26) of small wall thickness to one another in an articulated manner.  moreover, the hinge part (16) located on the carcase is connected adjustably to the associated screw-on plate (15, 19), so that the hinged connection can nevertheless be readjusted.  <image>
