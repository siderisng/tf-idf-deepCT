<ABSTRACT>
Naked movie sheet changer for radiodiagnostic apparatus that comprises a supply tray (22) for containing a stacked blank film reserve, associated with an extraction device (45) of one of the leaves. of the stack film (30), an exposure section (100) to which are successfully transferred the sheets to be placed between two presses trays (3, 5), one (5) is movable, which are provided with Reinforcing screens (4, 6) on their faces and placed in the X-ray exposure field, and a receiving store (23) for the shots exposed. The feed tray (22) is located in part under the exposure section (100) so as to allow the extraction device (45) which comprises coupling means constituted by a rectilinear rack (46) integral with the Lower part of the movable presser tray (5) and a pinion (47) engreging with this key lifter (46) to be driven by the single movement of the mobile tray (5). The pinion (47) entrans via a positive non-return signal the rotation of a roller (49) in one direction. The perimeter of the extraction roller (49) relying on the upper face of the battery (30) due to its mobile suspension in the normal direction, its unidirectional rotation has the effect of presenting the upper sheet of The battery (30) to a transfer device composed of motor rollers (36) and a pressure cylinder (38) rotating continuously, during each removal of the mobile (5) and fixed (2) trays.
