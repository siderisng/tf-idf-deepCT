<ABSTRACT>
the invention consists in a method of purifying an  insulin-containing aqueous ethanolic raw extract from  pancreas glands.  the extract - which has been subjected  to strong cooling and separation of the fat crystals formed  thereby and which has possibly been further prepurified -  is, with an ethanol concentration of 60-80 per cent by volume,  subjected to gel filtration, use being made as the gel  of sephadexÂ® lh-60.  the sephadex beads are swollen in  ethanol or in aqueous ethanol, preferably with a concentration  of at least 60 per cent by volume.  as eluant ethanol or  aqueous ethanol, preferably with a concentration of at least  60 per cent by volume, is likewise used.  the eluted insulin-containing fraction is a limpid liquid  totally freed from colouring substances and containing no  or practically no proteins having a larger molecule than  insulin or having a smaller molecule than insulin, but only  insulin derivatives with practically the same molecular size  as the insulin.  practically a 100% yield of insulin is obtained.
