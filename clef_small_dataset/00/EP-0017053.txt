<ABSTRACT>
a key copying machine including an electric motor  operated cutter unit with a supporting frame (21) therefor, an  adjustable feeler assembly (36,37), and a support facing the  cutter unit (28) and the feeler assembly (36,37) and having  means for clamping thereon the key to be copied and the  sample key and wherein means are provided allowing  relative movement between the support and the cutter unit  (28) and feeler assembly (36,37) and wherein the feeler of the  feeler assembly senses the shape of the sample key and  defines thereby the copying action of the cutter (28).  the  feeler assembly (36,37) has supporting means (31, 31a)  allowing at least an angular movement of the feeler assemÂ­ bly (36,37) independent within limits from the cutter unit (28)  and its supporting frame (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a key copying machine, with which a rotating cutter operated by an electric motor cats into a blank key a profile which is equal to that of a sample key and which is aensed by a feeler, said keys being locked on to a support. the keys may be coaxially locked on the support with such copying machines, the support is moved manually so that the feeler follows the profile of the key to be copied, while the cutter reproduces this profile on the blank key. in known machines, there is the disadvantage that at the moment of impact between the cutter and the blank key, the feeler has not yet become properly engaged between the teeth of the sample key, so that the cutter tends to move laterally. in addition the cut key comprises sharp edges in the zone between the profiled teeth, and these act on the revolving plugs of the lock. this is responsible for the well known difficulty to which cut keys are subject, namely of making lock opening difficult because these sharp edges tend to jam during key rotation0 it should be noted that the above mentioned undesired sharp edges may be present both on lateral surfaces delimiting the key notches and also on the bottom surface of the key notches. different attempts have been already made to remove the drawbacks regarding the above mentioned sharp edges on the bottom surface of the key notches by providing means which allow an adequate relative movement between the cutter and the key to be copied to be performed. such relative movement is normally a composite movement comprising translatory movement components along different axes perpendicular to each other and rotatory movements about different axes differently positioned to each other. such relative movements allow also to obtain selectively shaped bottom surfaces of the key notches. it has heretofore been believed that it is techni- cally more advantageous if such composite movements are performed manly by the support for the keys while maintaining the cutter unit and the feeler stationary positioned since both the construction and th d operation was believed to be simplier and more efficient in this way. attempts have also been made to select for the feeler a circular shape corresponding to the circular shape of the cutter to facilitate removal of the sharp edges on the bottom surfaces of the key notches, and to facilitate the relative movement between the circular feeler edge and the notch surface of the sample key. in order to remove the drawback regarding the sharp edges on the lateral surfaces of the key notches especially for those types of keys in which the notches or grooves have parallel side surfaces so that the width of the slot remains constant, attempts have also been made to use circular feelers having zones with different thicknesses so that for each-groove width of the key a suitable thickness zone of tie feeler may be selected. however, while this type of feeler
