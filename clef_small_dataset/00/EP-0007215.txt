<ABSTRACT>
carton forming apparatus comprises unitary corner ele­ ment erecting devices (9) which are independently movable  within the frame of the apparatus.  the erecting device (9)  include pressure plates (24) operable by piston and cylinder  units (22) for applying pressure to the overlapping portions of  an erected corner portion to cause an adhesive to become  effective.  in another embodiment a signal pressure plate is  common to two of the corner forming devices (9).  the particu­ lar combination of features of the apparatus allows for the  manufacture of an effective carton forming apparatus at low  cost and also allow ready adaptation of the apparatus to  cartons of different sizes.

<DESCRIPTION>
carton erecting apparatus technical field this invention relates to apparatus including devices and machines for erecting portions or the whole of carton blanks to make cartons or boxes. background art carton blanks are usually of planar form and have various crease lines and cut lines arranged so that portions of the carton can be erected with respect to other portions during passage of the carton in one direction through the apparatus for forming the carton from the blank. apparatus for the formation of cartons from planar blanks is generally of a complicated structure and includes a large number of moving parts designed to erect various elements of the blank with respect to each other around the aforementioned crease and cut lines. the complexity of known machines increases substantially when it is desired to provide a single machine for a number of different sizes of cartons or to include means for securing the box together in its finished state. british patents 936 743 and 1,35 498 498 describe such complex machines. disclosure of invention in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus for erecting a carton blank which includes a substantially polygonal base apd, in at least one corner area of the base, two side walls joined to the base along crease lines and extending away from the corner area and at least one uniting portion, parts of one or both said side walls and the or each uniting portion overlapping each other in the erected condition of the blank for holding the side walls erect, the apparatus comprising a plurality of independent devices for erecting respective corner portions of the blank, each such device comprising erecting elements for said side walls and the or each uniting portion arranged to be fixed in relation to each other, the side walls erecting elements extending at an angle to each other corresponding to the angle between the associated side walls in the erected condition of the carton and having a longitudinal extent such as to contact only the relatively short portion of the associated side walls lying adjacent the said corner area, and a forming mandrel arranged to move a carton blank past said erecting elements to erect the side walls and the or each uniting portion, and wherein there is associated with each said device a respective side wall support and guide located downstream with respect to the movement of the mandrel, of each associated side wall erecting element, which support and guide serves to hold the erected parts of the or each corner portion of the blanks in position against the forming mandrel, and wherein the support and guide for the overlapping ones of the erected parts of the corner portion is movable towards and away from the mandrel in a direction generally perpendicular to the direction of movement of the mandrel to cause the support and guide to be applied under substantial pressure against the mandrel with the overlapping parts of the corner portion of
