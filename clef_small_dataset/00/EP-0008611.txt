<ABSTRACT>
gaseous hydrogen chloride is obtained by a process in which   a) aqueous hydrochloric acid is extracted with an amine or a mixture of an amine and an inert, water- immiscible solvent boiling at not less than 120 deg c, the amine being a tertiary alkylamine which contains a total of 14 to 36 carbon atoms in the nitrogen-linked carbon chains, at most one of the nitrogen-linked carbon chains being a methyl group and at least one being an aliphatic radical containing at least 6 carbon atoms, the acid constant ka of the amine being less than 10<-3>, b) an inert, water-immiscible solvent boiling at not less than 120 deg c is added to the extract, unless all the solvent required has already been present in stage a), c) the extract is distilled, the resulting vapour is condensed, the water is continuously removed from the two-phase condensate, and the organic phase is returned to the distillation process, d) the extract is distilled, under reflux, after the water has been removed, and the gaseous hydrogen chloride liberated at the top of the column is taken off, or the hydrogen chloride is separated off at below the boiling point of the solvent by passing an inert gas stream through the mixture, and e) the solvent containing the amine is recycled to the extraction process after the amine has been treated with an absorbent to remove by products of the process.
