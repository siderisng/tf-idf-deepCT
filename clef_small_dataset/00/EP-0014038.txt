<ABSTRACT>
in a kilowatt-hour meter for measuring electrical ener­ gy consumption from an alternating electrical supply, a  microprocessor (20) includes a clock signal generator (22)  which is synchronised in phase with the incoming supply  frequency.  pulse sampling means (21) controlled by the  clock generator (22) sample the incoming voltage and cur­ rent waveforms at a preselected time instant or instants in  each cycle and the sampled data is utilised in the micro­ processor to determine energy consumption.
