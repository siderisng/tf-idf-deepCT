<ABSTRACT>
a process for dyeing expandable polystyrene beads  involves making an aqueous slurry, adding the dye and heat­ ing in a closed pressure vessel.  the only additive required is a  surfactant which wets the surface of the beads to reduce  surface tension and allow the dye to penetrate homogene­ ously through the beads.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements relating to the production of coloured expandable polystyrene" this invention relates to the production of coloured expandable polystyrene (e.p.s). an early proposal for dyeing pre-expanded polystyrene beads is described in us patent o. 3020247, but this had shortcomings. the process was difficult to control and resulted in surface dyeing only1 whereas the aim was, and is in this invention, to attain uniform colouring. throughout. failure to achieve this results in a mottled appearance in the final moulding of expanded beads. the problem appeared to be mainly one of time and temperature. the beads expand at more than 900c and if immersed in an open bath for more than 30minutes they lose too much blowing agent. thus the beads could not be heated for long nor at very high temperatures, and so the dye could not penetrate sufficiently, even with the recommended solvents. this process was soon superseded by one in which the dye vessel was closed and the dye was aided by a penetrant, as described in british patent no. 1064490. the dyeing was thus carried out under pressure, and higher temperatures and longer times could be used. a preferred penetrant was pentane, which is the commonest blowing anent for e.p.s. beads. this was an improvement, but a further advance was claimed in british patent no. 1314701, which proposed the use of a dye adjuvant rather than a bead penetrant. the dye adjuvant contained organic compounds which, it was believed, broke down the surface layer of the beads, swelling and softening the skin that impedes dye penetration. > neither of these methods are perfect. with the first one it has been found that the penetrant does not necessarily result in homogeneous colouring, and a fault with the favoured pentane penetrant is that the contents of the vessel tend to gel together, irrespective of agitation or stirring. with the second method, it is clearly undesirable to attack the structure of the beads. the aim of this invention is therefore to dye e,p,s, beads without the use of any additive to the aqueous slurry that will cause gelling or modification to the structure of the beads. the result should be dye and nothing but dye permeated right through all the still unexpanded beads. according to the present invention there is provic'd i process for producing coloured expandable polystyrene, wherein expandable non-coloured polystyrene beads are charged to a pressure vessel with water and oil soluble and/or spirit soluble dye, the resultant slurry is heated to at least 500c and subject to at least autogenous pressure in the closed vessel, and subseouently cooled, and the polystyrene beads, dyed and ready for expansion, are separated from the remaining contents of the vessel, characterised in that the sole initial active additive to the slurry, apart from the dye and optionally a diluent for the additive, is a surface active agent or surfactant incapable of penetrating or modifying the structure of the beads, but which acts to lower the surfacetension at, or "whet", the surface of

    oijaims       1. a process for producing coloured expandable polystyrene, wherein expandable non-coloured polystyrene beads are   enlarged    to a pressure vessel with water and oil soluble and/or spirit soluble dye, the resultant slurry is heated to at least   5000    and subject to at least autogenous pressure an the closed vessel, and subsequently cooled, and the polystyrene beads, dyed and ready for expansion are separated from the remaining contents of the vessel, characterised in that the sole initial active additive to the slurry, apart from the dye and optionally a diluent for the additive, is a surface active agent or surfactant incapable of penetrating or modifying the structure of the beads, but which acts to lower the surface tension at, or   "wet",    the surface of the beads to cause dye penetration.    2. a process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the surfactant is non-ionic, or is a mixture of anionic and cationic surfactants, and has an   kt'b    value of from 8 to 12.    3. a process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the proportion of surfactant is less than   1%    by weight of the total mix.    4. a process as claimed in claim 1, 2 or   3,    wherein the diluent includes an organic liquid.     5. a process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the diluent includes an alcohol.      6. a process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the surfactant is a blend of polyoxyethylene esters of mixed fatty acids  7. a process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the pressure vessel is left unpressurised during initial heating to a temperature in the range 400 - 800c and is then closed for heating to higher temperatures.    8. a process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the slurry is stirred or agitated.    9. a process as claimed in any preceding claims wherein a safety blanket of inert gas is provided for the slurry.    10. a process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the dye is of the monoazo, disazo or   anthraquinone    type.
