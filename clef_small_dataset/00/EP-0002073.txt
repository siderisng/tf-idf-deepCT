<ABSTRACT>
1.  a control device for a commercial vehicle provided with an anti-skid system, having a drive axle and a trailing axle disposed directly therebehind, the braking action on the drive axle and trailing axle being controlled in dependence upon the signals from sensors associated with the drive axle, characterised in that the trailing axle is a lift-up axle, in that the two wheels (5, 6) of the drive axle (3) are each provided with a sensor (7, 8), and in that the axle wheel (5 or 6) sensed at any given time determines, by way of a common pressure-control valve (19 or 20), the side-wise regulation of the brake pressure of the corresponding wheel of the lift-up axle (15 or 16) running in the same track, and in that means (25, 26; 32, 33; 35) are used by which the braking action on the wheels (15, 16) of the lift-up axle (4) is reduced relative to the braking action on the wheels (5, 6) of the drive axle (3).
