<ABSTRACT>
A method for removing a tubular heat exchanger from the lower chamber a probe apparatus that can be attached to the exchanger using expandable mandrels with at least one guide tube for a control probe. From the opening of access to the chamber, it is introduced into the guide tube (15) and into the water tube (2) which faces the extremity of a false probe constituted by a tube ( 18) In a relatively rigid material, but can nevertheless bending slightly, provided with said end of a fixing means (19-20) to the water tube, controllable from the other end of the tube, we fix said end to the water tube (2), and the mandrels of the probe holder is loosened, so that this unit slides along the tube (18) of the false probe to the access opening and can thus be evacuated to the outside. The invention also relates to a false probe for the implementation of this method and a method for replacing a probe holder with the aid of this false probe.
