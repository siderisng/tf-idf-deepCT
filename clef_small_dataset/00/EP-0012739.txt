<ABSTRACT>
A throttle coil usually consists of nuclear columns connected by Joche (4), wherein the core columns consist of individual, by unmagnetic between layers (3) separated, radial-panel packets (2). Both the nuclear columns and yokes (4) have cylindrical recesses which serve to accommodate central tension bolts with the help of which the entire construction is pressed and held. The magnetic flux is forced by these recesses to avoid transversely to the sheets into the edge zones, thereby increasing the recessed edges we increasing beltroom losses and to dangerous heating. In order to avoid such disadvantages, the packets (2) of the nuclear pillars applied to the jochen (4) in Rich tung of the yokes (4) are wedge-shaped extinguishing (7) and the yokes (4) in cross-section rectangular (6) unmagnetic Linegers up. These intermediate layers (6, 7) are arranged in the interrupted by the recesses central region.
