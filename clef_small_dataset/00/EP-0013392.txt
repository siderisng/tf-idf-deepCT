<ABSTRACT>
a dividing network in order to be compatible with the  impedance of the line or load and to fit to an arbitrary crosÂ­ sover frequency comprises a dividing network element (24)  formed by winding a pair of strip members (22a, 22b) of high  electro-conductivity arranged opposedly to each other with a  dielectric member interposed (21a), 21b) therebetween,  inductance formed in said wound strip members (22a, 22b),  capacitance formed between said strip members (22a, 22b)  and a plurality of terminals (27,28,29,30) selectively led out  from the end portions (25a, 25b, 26a) or other portion of said  pair of the strip members (22a, 22b).
