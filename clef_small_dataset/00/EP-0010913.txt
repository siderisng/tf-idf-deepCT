<ABSTRACT>
a composite reverse buckling disc assembly consist­ ing of two portions, a concav-convex dome portion (2) and  a support portion (6).  the support portion (6) includes an  annular outer part (8) for clamping between opposed inlet  and outlet support means (12, 14) of a safety pressure re­ lief device and an inner part (10) for location in the bore  through said device.  the dome portion (2) is located on  the support portion (6) such that, on reversal of said dome  portion (2) when it is subjected to the critical pressure of  the assembly, said reversing dome portion (2) engages  with the inner part (10) of the support portion (6) with suffi­ cient force to break said inner part (10) away from the  clamped outer part (8), whereby the dome portion (2) is  released from the assembly and full-bore discharge  through the safety pressure relief device occurs.
