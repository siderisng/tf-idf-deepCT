<ABSTRACT>
ammunition comprising a lead bullet having a coating  comprised of polymeric material, e. g.  a polyamide which  may include a solid lubricant such as molybdenum disulfide  nylon 11 per se and other coatings are disclosed.  the  coating minimizes or prevents deposition of lead along the  barrel and other mechanisms of a firearm.  in the preferred  method of manufacture, the bullet is degreased, roughened  and heated to clean its surfaces.  a phosphate coating is  applied and the bullet is heated to a temperature of at  least 425°f.  the heated bullet is then disposed in blended  molybdenum disulfide and nylon 11 powder, nylon 11 per  se; or other coating materials to obtain a coating thickness  within a range of 1 to 12 mils.  the coated bullet is subse­ quently heated to at least 367°f to fuse and to densify the  coating on the bullet.
