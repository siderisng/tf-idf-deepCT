<ABSTRACT>
a kit for applying a design, like a colored emblem, to a  fabric, like a t-shirt, comprises a transfer sheet (50) having an  obverse surface (50a) and a rear surface (50b) with a pattern  (52a) to be transferred generated on the obverse surface, and  a copy sheet (54) juxtaposed with said rear surface.  the said  copy sheet includes a substrate (58) of paper, plastic or the like  and a surface layer (56) of pressure or heat transferable col­ ored material.  when applying heat or pressure energy  through said transfer sheet (50) to said substrate (58) a trans­ ferable mirror image (52b) of said design is generated on the  rear surface of the transfer sheet.  the mirror image after  having removed the transfer sheet from the copy sheet, may  be transferred to a contiguous fabric, like a t-shirt, in response  to the application of energy to the obverse surface.
