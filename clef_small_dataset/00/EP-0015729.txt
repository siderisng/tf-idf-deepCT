<ABSTRACT>
the formation of improved intercalated graphitic carbon  fibers of further diminished electrical resistivity (i. e. , increased  electrical conductivity) is made possible.  not only is the specif­ ic electrical resistivity of the resulting fibers reduced (e. g. , to  extremely low levels no greater than that of copper in preferred  embodiments), but the desirable tensile properties of the fi­ bers are maintained at a satisfactory level even after intercala­ tion.  a carbonaceous fibrous material containing the usual tur­ bostratic graphitic carbon which is derived from an acrylonitrile  homopolymer or a closely related copolymer (as defined) is se­ lected and is structurally modified in a manner which has been  found to render it particularly suited for intercalation as evi­ denced by a further reduction in the electrical resistivity of the  resulting intercalated fibrous material while retaining other de­ sirable properties.  more specifically, the carbonaceous fibrous  material (as defined) prior to intercalation with an electron ac­ ceptor intercalating agent is modified via an atypical extremely  high temperature treatment so as to yield a modified structure  which can be evidenced upon wide angle x-ray diffraction anal­ ysis, i. e.  resolved graphitic miller index (100) and (101) reflec­ tions and the presence of a (112) reflection are observed,  which surprisingly has been found capable of subsequently  yielding an improved intercalated product having a substantial­ ly reduced electrical resistivity.  the intercalated product finds  utility as an improved lightweight electrical conductor.
