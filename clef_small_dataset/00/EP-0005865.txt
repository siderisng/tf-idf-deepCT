<ABSTRACT>
Connecting system for pressure lines, in particular plastic lines for brake systems, consisting of a housing part and a connecting coupling part with this connectable coupling part. The housing part (366) and the coupling part (354) are connectable via a plug-in system. The housing part (366) has a through-hole (353), in which the end of the coupling part (354) formed as a plug is sealingly insertionable. The plug shaft of the connector (354) is held by means of a lock in the through hole. The lock consists of a central ring centric (359) centric (313 a), which preferably has a three-point system in the receiving groove. The sealing of the connection system inwardly takes place advantageously by a rubber buffer (404) arranged below the plug shaft in the through hole (404), which simultaneously serves as a spring element for generating a bias voltage in the connection system. In addition, a sealing is provided to the outside by means of a O-sealing ring (375 a) arranged in the plug shaft (354) and a sealing ring (374) in the thread portion of a screwed nut (368) which is screwed into the housing part (366), wherein by unscrewing the screw nut (368) The connection system according to the invention can be solved. The housing part of the connecting system may be designed as an adapter and as a molded part with plug-in opening and plug pin or be integrated directly in an aggregate housing.
