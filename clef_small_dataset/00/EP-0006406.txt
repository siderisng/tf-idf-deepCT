<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a cover for use in neuro足 surgical operations on brain and spinal cord, which con足 sists of a porous sheet (1) of a hydrophilic polymer sub足 stance having a substantially continuous cellular struc足 ture and being non-reactive to living body tissues.  the  sheet (1) may have a thread (2) attached thereto.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
cover sheet for brain and spinal cord in neurosurgical operation the present invention relates to a cover which is to be placed on the brain and spinal cord, for the purpose of protecting them against drying and damages during the operation. neurosurgical operations on the brain and spinal cord involve an extreme danger, and an inadvertent damage on the essential part thereof is on occasion fatal or may be attended with serious postoperative complication subsequent to the operation. the circulation of blood in the brain is so vigorous that even an injury inflicted on a small vessel would cause an intense bleeding. accordingly, in order to protect those parts of the neurosurgical operation field which need no operative intervention, to prevent them from getting dry, and to minimize mechanical damages thereon during operation, it is necessary to provide a cover to be placed on the brain and spinal cord. as a cover for this purpose in the prior art, there is used one prepared by cutting gauze, absorbent cotton or nonwoven fabric after the shape of the operation field, sterilizing the thus cut material and thereafter wetting it with a physiological saline solution for softening. however, in the case of an operation requiring much time, a cover of this kind would partially get dry, causing such troubles that a portion of the brain tissue peels off along with the cover at the time of the removal thereof, or a part of fibers of the cover is inadvertently left behind as a foreign substance in the brain tissue. besides, the fiber material is apt to be finely splitted and to get fluffy easily, so the visual field under the operating microscope is not infrequently obstructed. the brain tissue is very soft to the touch like pudding and is apt to be injured. accordingly, a cover sheet for the purpose of covering thejurface of the operation field during the neurosurgical operation so as to protect the brain tissue against damages should meet such requirements as follows: 1. it should touch the brain tissue very softly. 2. since the operation field is exposed to an illuminant and the brain tissue tends to get dry, it should have a sufficient water-holding capacity. 3. there should not be caused falling-off of any substance including fibers at the time of removing the cover sheet from the surface of the brain tissue. 4. it should be water-insoluble, essentially non-reactive to body tissues as well as fluids, and harmless to the patient. 5. it should permit to conduct the suction of fluid such as saline solution, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood from above the cover sheet. 6. it should be uniformly thin and not fluffy so as not to obstruct the view at the time of conducting operation under the operating microscope. the present invention has as its object to provide a cover for use in neurosurgical operation on brain and spinal cord which is capable of sufficiently meeting the aforementioned requirements. the invention as characterized in the enclosed

patent claims   1. a cover for use in neurosurgical operation on the  cerebrospinal medulla, characterized in that said  cover is non-reactive to body tissues and is formed  of a porous sheet (1) of a hydrophilic polymer sub  stance being water-absorbent, hydrophilic, water  insoluble, resistant to chemicals and pliable and  having a substantially continuous cellular structure,  said porous sheet (1) having a thickness of about 0.5  to about 3 mm, a water-holding capacity of about 8 to  about 19 times as much as the dry weight of the sheet,  porosity of about 85 to about 95%, and an excellent  pliability in wet condition.    2. a cover according to claim 1, characterized in that  said porous sheet (1) is provided with a colored thread  (2) fixed thereto.   3. a cover according to claim 2, characterized in that  said colored thread (2) contains an x-ray contrast medium.   4. a cover according to claim 1, characterized in that  said porous sheet (1) is made of polyvinylformal.   5. a cover according to claim 1, characterized in that  said porous sheet (1) is made of viscose sponge.
