<ABSTRACT>
a method of treating a surface of a metal plate (10) com­ prises projecting sharp non-metallic particles at the surface  whilst the surface is at a temperature such as to be in a fluid or  substantially fluid state.  the particles employed are prefer­ ably made by forming a mix of particles of granite, feldspathic  rock and aluminium oxide with a kaolin or other clay binder,  compressing the mix into blocks, firing and crushing the  blocks.  the blocks may be crushed before or after firing.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method of treating metal plate" the present invention relates to surface treatment of metal plates with sharp, non-metallic particles. the principal purpose of this treatment is to render the plates sl? prnof and thus permit .m to be used as decking plates on shlps and other ;cations. however other applications for such plates, such as carriers for abrasives, are also foreseen. it is already known to coat ship deck plates with a plastic material, incorporating suspended sharp particles. thus epoxy resin coatings have been loaded with gritstone fillers for that purpose but have been only partically satisfactory in service. we have now found that an improved non-slip plate can be achieved by avoiding the use of a plastic coating to bond the sharp particles to the metal plate. in accordance with the present invention we project the sharp non-metallic particles at a metallic plate which has been heated to such an extent that its surface is in a fluid or softened condition at the moment of impact of such particles thereon. the heating of the metal plate may be carried out in a variety of ways. preferably however the heating is carried ou: to effect surface-melting of the plate in a single narrow transverse band which travels along the plate. such a surface-melted ;;and is most conveniently generated by moving the plate past a heating station lich it is subjected to intense local surface heating by means of, for example, an array of gas orches, welding electrodes such as are used in tungsten/inert gas welding or plasma torches. the non-metallic particles are projected against the surface of the metal plate either within the narrow band subjected to heating to effect surface melting or in the zone immdiat-; succeeding said band so that the particles strike the metal surface whilst till molten or in a heat-softened condition. the particles should strike the metal surface with sufficient force to embed them firmly in the metal without at the same time submerging the particles to such extent that they project insufficiently from the subsequently solidified metal surface to achieve the result for which they are intended, over a prolonged service life. in general it may be said that satisfactory bonding of the particles into the metal surface will be achieved where rather more than half the volume of the individual particles lie within the metal, but this will vary hoth with the size of the particles and the shape of such particles. it is envisaged that the method of the invention will involve the use of coarse, sharp grit of a particle size in the range of 2 - 5 mm, although particles of smaller size down to 100 microns may be used, preferably in a xfure with the envisaged coarse grit, although in some circumstances, these small particles may be used by themselves. it is envisaged that the force required to project the pa':t:icles at c;ie metal plate to achieve adequate penetration of the metal surface could be generated either by centrifugal

 claims   1. a method of treating a metal plate e.g. a steel or aluminium plate characterised by the step of projecting sharp non-metallic particles on to a surface of the plate which has been heated to such an extent that the surface is in a fluid or substantially fluid state.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the particle size is in the range 2 to 5 mm.   3. a method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the particles are projected on to said surface by centrifugal action.   4. a method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the particles are projected on to said surface by a high speed gas stream.   5. a method as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the gas stream is pre-heated.   6. a method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the particles are produced by forming a mix consisting essentially of particles of granite or other feldspathic rock and aluminium oxide particles in the size range of 10 preferably less than   125p,    the aluminium oxide forming 2% to 30%, preferably 5% to 15%, of the mix and a clay, preferably kaolin, or other binder, compressing the mix to form coherent   "green"    blocks and firing the compressed "green" material for a time and temperature sufficient to form the mix into a matrix containing hard sharp alumina particles, and comminuting the compressed material before or after firing.      7. a metal plate characterised by a coating of sharp non-metallic particles embedded in the metal surface.   8. a metal plate as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that the particles are produced by forming a mix consisting essentially of particles of granite or other feldspathic rock and aluminium oxide particles in the size range of 10 preferably less than   125 > ,    the aluminium oxide forming 2% to 30%, preferably 5% to 15%, of the mix and a clay, preferably kaolin, or other binder, compressing the mix to form coherent "green" blocks and firing the compressed "green" material for a time and temperature sufficient to form the mix into a matrix containing hard sharp alumina particles, and comminuting the compressed material before or after firing.
