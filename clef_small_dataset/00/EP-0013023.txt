<ABSTRACT>
In this method, cereals in a cereal mill (10) with control means (14, 16) for controlling, including locking of process elements (grinding material and attachment elements) (12) and associated operational per zeßparameter, in particular during the start-up, work and outflow phase , Grim. For facilitating the guidance of the method and the grain mill system by the Obermüller, to increase their stability, operational safety and transparency, and for the optimal division of labor between Obermüller, control and machine park, for controlling the Ver driving is initially from a group of selected pre-sets or specified process parameters. and target variables. Thereafter, the process sizes of the selected group are determined to be determined quantitative and qua litative values ​​and in groups as inputti gnal sizes (Q₁M₁.,, QNMN) used to control, each of the group of input signal sizes determined from the predetermined process sizes (STO₁₁,). , Stone) is assigned and the groups obtained by the assignment (STO₁₁,,, ston) for automatic control of such control chains and / or control circles are used to influence the opera tive process parameters (direct) directly to the process elements. For this purpose, a grain mill system is provided on the control means (14, 16) assembly (30), which has at least one storage unit (42) whose signal outputs (43₁ ,.,, 43N) are connected to the control inputs of the control chains and control circuits. The memory unit (42) is fer ner for addressing the stored in it-stored groups of control signals (STO₁₁,,,, STONN) by the grupen of the selected input signal size N (Q₁M₁,,,, QNMN). Also, the cereal mill (10) in hierarchical is a one overlaid, yet decentralized and far-step autonomous tax benches.
