<ABSTRACT>
The water water is carried out, for example, the water vapor produced in a turbo-alternator turbine is used under pressure to produce electricity, the residual freshwater vapor is condensed and we recover as under -Product the residue of evaporation, for example sea salt. The water vapor is sent directly or at its outlet of the turbine, on the iron heated to about 800 Â° C, which supplies hydrogen and, as a by-product, ferric oxide and the source of the source. Initial energy is, in addition to solar energy, any unprofitable source of energy, such as coal at large depths. The starting aqueous substance is, in addition to seawater, the residual sludge, a solution of gemsel salt or a mixture of sludge and saline solution. In the case of sludge, the by-product is a dry and sterilized fertilizer, convertible into tiable combus briquettes. The salt residue is transformed by hydrogen electrolysis and sodium chlorate, which is a fuel, the sludge-salt residue provides a combustible mixture, sodium chlorine muds, mixed with garbage to promote the fuel of it. . Sodium chlorate is convertible into chlorate potas sium and pressurized water vapor can be condensed in remote tanks and its recovered heat. The energies produced are usable in the process.
