<ABSTRACT>
a fluid flow restricting apparatus for use in a fluid mixer  comprises a body (200) of solid material housing capillary  tubes (226) in passages (206 to 224).  nuts (240) compress  elastomeric o-ring sealing members (242) such that they  make fluid-tight seals between the capillary tubes and their  respective passages.  an inlet header (202) is demountably  attached to the body (200) and has inlets (246, 248, 250 and  252) communicating with chambers (254, 256, 258 and 260)  respectively.  by means of the chambers, the inlet (246) is  placed in communication with the capillary tubes in pas­ sages (206, 208, 210 and 212); the inlet (248) with the tubes in  passages (214, 216 and 218): the inlet (250) with the tubes in  passages (220 and 222) and the inlet (252) with the tube in  the passage (224).  the outlets of the capillary tubes com­ municate with a common outlet passage (236).  the appar­ atus may be readily dismantled and reassembled to allow  the capillary tubes to be changes.
