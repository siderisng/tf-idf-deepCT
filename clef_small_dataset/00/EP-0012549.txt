<ABSTRACT>
support means for an endless load-carrying belt for  causing it to trough in the region of a loading point and for  supporting it across its entire width in that region, the sup­ port means being constituted by a troughing mat (10) extend­ ing completely across the conveyor, the opposite ends of the  troughing mat (10) being secured to bearers (12) disposed on  opposite sides of the conveyor and capable of being engular­ ly adjusted to suit the degree of troughing required.  screw  means (32) are provided for adjusting the positions of the  bearers (12) on angularly adjustable brackets (14) by which  they are carried so that a height adjustment of the troughing  mat can accompany an angular adjustment of the bearers  (12).
