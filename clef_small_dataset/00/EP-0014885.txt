<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel pyrimidine derivatives of the formula wherein at least one of the rings a and b represents a trans-1.4 disubstituted cyclohexane ring and the other is optionally aromatic and R is a straight-chain alkyl or alkoxy group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a branched alkyl group C₂H₅-CH (CH₃) - (CH₂) N- where n is an integer of 1 to 3. The invention also relates to the preparation of the compounds of formula I by dehydration of a compound of formula wherein A, B and R have the above meaning, or for the preparation of compounds of formula I, wherein ring A represents a cyclohexyl ring and ring b a benzene ring, By reacting a compound of the formula wherein R and A have the above meaning and represents x fluorine, chlorine or bromine, with copper (I) cyanide or with sodium or potassium cyanide. The invention further relates to nematic and cholesteric mixtures which contain compounds of formula I and, optionally, dichroic dyes containing electro-optical devices containing compounds of formula I, the use of the compounds of formula I for electro-optical purposes, as well as the preparation of such mixtures and devices. The compounds of formula I are particularly valuable as components of liquid crystalline mixtures. They have particularly large mesophase regions with high sewage points, a great positive anisotropy of the dielectric constants and accordingly lower threshold voltages, a short response time and great chemical stability.
