<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement serves to suppress high-frequency flows in bearings of waves with capacitive treatment facilities with operating frequencies in MegaHertzbe rich.The substance (26) resulting from the bearing capacity is arranged in such a four-pole (28) that the high-frequency voltage remains smaller than 0.7V.The minimization of the voltage is achieved in mass of free waves by a parallel to the bearing abrasive contact.The particular element of the four-pole (28) is - in addition to the abrasive contact - a high-resistance parallel resonant circuit (33, 34), whose capacitance (34) is formed by an insulating plate and its inductance (33) are formed by an insulating plate and its inductance (33) by a winding.
