<ABSTRACT>
electrical connecting means and an electric motor stator  assembly.  an insulating housing mounted on an electric motor stator  (6) receives slotted plate terminals (34) connected to leads (24,  28, 30), the ends of the stator windings (2 and 4), which extend  through slots (62, 64, 66, 68) in the housing, being received in  the slots (36, 38) of the terminals (34).  to enable the terminals (34) all to be identical, where the  windings (2 and 4) are of different gauges, as in an induction  electric motor stator (6), and to ensure that the terminals (34)  can only be inserted into the housing in their correct orientations,  each terminal (34) has two slots, one (36) dimensioned to  receive the main stator winding (2) and the other (38) to receive  the auxiliary stator winding (4), two of the slots (62 and 68) of the  housing being dimensioned to receive the auxiliary winding (4).
