<ABSTRACT>
feline infectious peritonitis is a disease of members of  the genus felix which is almost invariably fatal, and for which  there is currently no vaccine available.  indeed many attempts  to isolate and grow the virus have failed.  by passaging a  virulent isolate of felix infectious peritonitis virus in feline  embryonic cell cultures until the infected cell cultrues exhibit a  cytopathic effect, then inactivating the virus and presenting it  in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, an  inactivated vaccine suitable for immunisation purposes can  be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
feline infectious peritonitis vaccine this invention relates to a method of preparing an inactivated feline infectious peritonitis vaccine, hereinafter referred to as fip vaccine, and in particular to a vaccine made by the method, which is useful in the prevention of fip. in a further aspect the invention relates to a method for developing immunity to fip in animals of the genus felix. feline infectious peritonitis is an important disease of both domestic and wild felidae because it is almost invariably fatal. the disease was first recognised in about 1950 and reported under the name chronic fibrinous peritonitis (j. amer. vet. med. assoc., 144, 1409-1420, (1963)). since then fip has been diagnosed in north america, europe, south africa australasia and japan. ore recently the causative organism has been described as a corona-like virus (nature, 266, 682, (1977)). animals which contract the disease become lethargic and inappetant. fluid collects in the peritoneal cavity with the result that the abdomen becomes enlarged and the cat eventually dies in a jaundiced state. whilst therapy and supportive treatment may prolong the course of the disease, all animals showing clinical signs eventually die, (j. amer. vet. hecl. assoc., 154, 26-35, (1969)). it has long been recognised that a vaccine is required to prevent fip outbreaks (j. after. vet. med. assoc., 155, 1728-1733, (1969)), however many attempts to isolate and grow the virus have failed. it has recently been reported that fip virus has been grown in feline small intestine organ culture, (the cornell veterinarian, 68, 411-417, (1978)), but this is not a practical method for vaccine production. it has now been found that an inactivated fip vaccine can be prepared b passaging an isolate of virulent ftp in feline embryonic cell cultures until the infected cultures exhibit a characteristic cytopathic effect (cpe), as hereinafter described, inactivating the virus so produced, and presenting the virus in associ,tion with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. accor-ding to the present invention in one aspect there is provided a method eor preparing an inactivated feline infectious peritonitis vaccine comprising serially passaging an isolate of virulent fip in feline embryonic cell cultures until the infected cultures exhibit a cpe characteristic of pip, inactivating the virus so produced, and presenting the inactivated virus in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. virulent f1p virus may be isolated from the peritoneal fluid, blood, urine and various organs of a cat suffering from the disease. in the case of the peritoneal fluid, the urine, the infected fluid may be inoculated directly on to the selected cell cultures. for isolating virus from the blood the infected animal may be bled from the jugular or any other suitable vein. the sample is subsequently allowed to clot, is then removed and triturated, for example in a pestle and mortar, and resuspended in a suitable medium, such as phosphate buffered saline. the suspension is then centifuged to remove gross tissue debris the supernatant fluid is removed and used to inoculate cell cultures. virus may be obtained from such organs as

   claims      1. a method for preparinq an inactivated feline infectious  peritonitis vaccine characterised in that an isolate  of virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus is serially  passaged in feline embryonic cell cultures until the  infected cultures exhibit a   cytopathic    effect, that is the cells  produce irregular   shapes    when examined microscopically as   wet    preparations, the virus so produced is inactivated and  presented in association with a   pharmaceutically      acceptable     carrier.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1 further characterised in that  the embryonic cell cultures comprise diploid feline  embryonic lung cells.      a    a method as claimed in claim 1 further characterised in that    the    feline embryonic cell cultures comprise heteroploid  feline embryonic lung cells.    4. a method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 further  characterised in that the virus is inactivated by  chemical means.      5.    a   me as      c3 aimed    in any one of claims 1 to 3   further     characterised in that the virus is inactivated by physical  means.   6. a   vaccine    for developing immunity in animals to feline  infectious   peritollitist    prepared according to method of      claim    1, in an   effective      dosage,    or multiples thereof 7. a vaccine as claimed in claim   6    further characterised  in that the effective dosage is from 104.0 to  tcid50 per ml.
