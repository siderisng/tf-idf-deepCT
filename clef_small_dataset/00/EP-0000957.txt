<ABSTRACT>
a microwave oven sensing system having a humidity  sensor and a temperature sensor at an exit ventilation port  of a microwave oven heating cavity to sense the exiting  humidity and the air temperature of the microwave oven  heating cavity is disclosed.  the sensors connect to a programmable  controller and input the sensed humidity and  temperature of the microwave oven heating cavity to a programmable  controller.  characteristic humidity curves for  microwave cooking of different types of foods are stored  in the memory of the programmable controller and the  programmable controller controls the microwave cooking  in accordance with a selected algorithm for the sensed  environmental conditions.  a numeric keyboard control  panel inputs to the programmable controller the microwave  cooking parameters and selects the desired characteristic  humidity curve.  the programmable controller may  control a microwave power source control circuit and an  air exchange circuit according to the selected algorithm in  the programmable controller.
