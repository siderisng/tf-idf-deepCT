<ABSTRACT>
Circuit arrangement for evaluating the output signals output from a clock of different amplitudes and to generate clock signals from the same. Tact signals are required if a process is to run at a specific time. Thus, a clock signal is required to trigger the printing operation at a printer. These clock signals are generated by means of a clock, which outputs a clock signal each time when the process is to occur. The clock signal (UG) is supplied to a threshold circuit (TS1), which outputs rectangular pulses (US), the duration of which depends on the time of exceeding the threshold (SC1) of the threshold circuit by the clock signals. The capacitor of a discharge circuit is discharged from an initial value with a first unloading current upon occurrence of the front edge of the pulse (US). Upon occurrence of the back edge of the pulse, the capacitor (C12) is further discharged with a second, double value of the first exposure of the current having unloading current. The capacitor (C12) of the discharge circuit is connected to another threshold circuit (TS2) that outputs the clock signal when the potential of the capacitor falls below a fixed threshold.
