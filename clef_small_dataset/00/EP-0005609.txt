<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for shielding molten metal during teeming,  characterized in that it comprises a first arm pivotably  mountable on a carriage for carrying a ladle, a second arm  pivotably mountable on said carriage, a first cylinder open at  both ends, connected to said first arm and having one end  which, during teeming, is urged against the pouring spout on  the bottom of a ladle mounted on said carriage, a second  cylinder open at both ends, connected to said second arm,  and moveable relative to said first cylinder to vary the  distance between said first and second cylinders, and means  to introduce a shielding gas into the interior of said cylinders,  the arrangement being such that, is use, after the pouring  spout of a ladle is arranged over a pouring trumpet, said  arms can be moved so that said first and second cylinders  define a passageway between the pouring spout on the ladle  and the pouring trumpet into which shielding gas can be  introduced via said means to inhibit air coming into contact  with molten metal as it passes through said passageway.
