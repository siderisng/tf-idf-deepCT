<ABSTRACT>
a clutch release mechanism (m) employs a bearing  assembly with a rotatable race (10) serving to actuate a clutch  and a stationary race (12) supported by a hub or thrust sleeve  (17) to which external force (f) is applied.  the bearing  assembly is permitted to move bodily radially to achieve  self-alignment with the clutch.  a chamber (24) is provided radially adjacent the  stationary race (12) and contains a filler medium displaced by  the radial adjustment of the bearing assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in clutch release mechanisms the present invention relates to clutch release mechanisms incorporating rolling element bearing assemblies. it is well known to employ a rolling element bearing assembly as a thrust bearing in the clutch release mechanism for a motor vehicle clutch. in one known conven- tional form of mechanism, the axis of rotation of the bearing assembly is constrained to be substantially ccinciderlt with the transmission shaft, which may or may not be coincident with the axis of rotation of the clutch on final vehicle assembly. customarily, one race or ring of tne bearing assembly is rotatable, relative to the other and is engageable directly, or indirectly by means of a suitable adapting element, with an associated contact surface of the clutch under an axial thrust force to effect clutch release. considerable frictional sliding, scuffing and hence wear, heat and noise generation, can be produced as a result nf the contact between the contacting surfaces, if slight misalignment or non-coincidence of the axes of rotation occurs. as described in uk patent specification 1478612, it is possible to provide a positive drive location by means of projections on one contacting surface engaging with slots in the other surface so that, inter alia, wear due to circumferencial sliding can be reduced. nevertheless, slight misalignment or non-coincidence of the rotational ae: an still occur. in another known form of mechanism described in uk patent specification 1126058, the axis of rotation of the bearing assembly is not constrained as aforementioned, and the entire bearing assembly can be displaced radially to ensure coincidence between the respective axes of rotation. in order to retain the bearing assembly in the desired location, an axially directed spring force is applied to the end faces of the non-rotating bearing race to produce a 'frictional grip'. it has been found that if any oil or grease should become present in the vicinity of the end faces, the frictional force locating the bearing can be reduced and the assembly can slip out of the concentric position. a general object of the present invention is to provide an improved form of clutch release mechanism. a clutch release mechanism made in accordance with the invention employs a bearing assembly composed of inner and outer rings or races, with rolling elements therebetween and, as is known, the bearing assembly may employ a cage for locating the rolling elements, and seals for retaining lubricant in the assembly and for preventing the ingress of contaminants. one of the races is intended to rotate and contact part of an associated clutch directly or indirectly to impart thrust force thereto for clutch release the other race is preferably guided for axial mcwement in response to said force. in accordance with the invention, a chamber containing a displaceable filler medium is defined radially adjacent the other race. this chamber can assume a symmetrical or asymmetrical profile relative to the axis of rotation of the assembly. hence, the entire bearing assembly consisting of the inner and outer races,
