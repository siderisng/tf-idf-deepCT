<ABSTRACT>
a stabilized absorbent rayon web (1) which may be  used alone or which may serve as outer piles for absor足 bent structures.  the rayon web (2) may be a spunbonded  web or an air laid, wet laid or carded web of staple  length or longer fibers, with substantial fiber orientation  in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the web by  virtue of the way in which the web is formed or by virtue  of mechanical or hydraulic needling.  the thermoplastic  web (3) is melted into the rayon web from the bottom  surface thereof to a controlled penetration depth of from  about 10% to about 40% and preferably from about  10% to about 25%.  as a result, the cross over points of  the rayon fibers are effectively stabilized form the bottom  of the rayon web to the controlled penetration depth  therein while the aesthetics of the upper surface of the  rayon web are undisturbed.  the thermoplastic web may  be of any appropriate polymer and any structured form  having an open area of at least about 40%.  the stabiliz足 ed rayon web demonstrates improved resistance to sur足 face abrasion, improved tensile strength, improved web  bulk and resiliency and improved dimensional stability,  both wet and dry.  the bottom surface of the stabilized rayon web can  be heat bonded to other webs without the use of ad足 ditional thermoplastic material.
