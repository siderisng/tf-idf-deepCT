<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for decaffeinating raw coffee, in which the caffeine is extracted by means of an aqueous liquid and is adsorbed on an adsorption agent from the liquid, characterized in that the adsorption agent is pre-loaded with at least one water-soluble raw coffee constituent, which is not ot be bound on the adsorption agent out of the liquid, or with a substance having the same molecular structure and weight and the degree of loading is adjusted so that an adsorption equilibrium exists between the liquid and the adsorption agent in respect to the said raw coffee constituent or of the said raw coffee constituents, with the exception of caffeine and that then the decaffeinated extract obtained in this way is concentrated and once more combined with the raw coffee which has been dried in the meantime or that decaffeinated extract is used as the aqueous liquid for extracting the caffeine from the raw coffee, whereby in this case the concentration of water-soluble raw coffee constituents in the caffeine-free extract is so high that apart from the caffeine, virtually no other water-soluble raw coffee constituents are dissolved out of the raw coffee.
