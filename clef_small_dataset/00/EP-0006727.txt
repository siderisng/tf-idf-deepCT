<ABSTRACT>
an optical scanner is incorporated in a thermal imaging  system which generates high resolution images at commercial  t. v.  rates while scanning relatively large apertures.  a facet  mirror (25) is mounted for rotation about a vertical rotational axis  (33), and a framing mirror (43) is mounted on the optical axis  (51) for oscillation about a horizontal oscillatory axis (59).  an off  axis, magnifying relay lens system (41) including an objective  lens (45) and an eyepiece (47) re-images the pupil at the facet  mirror onto the framing mirror, so that there is a real pupil at the  framing mirror with no image artifacts.  the relay lens system  (41) is located in the optical path between the facet mirror (25)  and the framing mirror (43) and provides a magnification of  about 1. 8.  the relay lens system defines an image plane (53)  and at least one point blockbody is located substantially at the  image plane for purposes of providing a video reference and  calibration.  a detector (21) receives the focused beam of radiaÂ­ tion reflected by the facet mirror through a collimator (23) for  subsequent display on commercial t. v.  monitors (19).  the  detector shares vacuum with the high-speed scanner.
