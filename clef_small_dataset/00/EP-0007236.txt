<ABSTRACT>
a mineral assemblage containing immobilised high level  radioactive waste (mlw), said assemblage comprising cryst­ als belonging to, or having crystal structures closely related to  crystals belonging to, mineral classes which are resistant to  leaching and alteration in appropriate geologic environments  and including crystals belonging to he titanate classes of  minerals, and said assemblage having elements of said hlw  incorporated in solid solution within the crystals thereof.  the assemblage is made by mixing the hlw and selected  oxides including tio₂ and thus heating and cooling to crystal­ lise the mixture.  the assemblage preferably contains crystals of or struc­ turally related to at least three of the mineral classes perovs­ kite, zirconolite, hollandite-type mineral, barium felspar, leuc­ ite, kalsilite, and nepheline; or at least two of the mineral  classes perovskite, zirconolite and hollandite-type mineral.
