<DESCRIPTION>
title ceramic composition useful for machining ca#t iron, and its method of manufacture. dsscript}on this invention relates to ceramic compositions and articles made therefrom. ceramic compositions composed principally of silicon nitride tsi 4) have found significant use as ceramic components for machines or as vessel coatings. this material is known to have many good characteristics such as high oxidation resistance at high temperatures (1400 c), good mechanical strength at high temperatures, and good hardness at high temperature. the strength of this material is related to its density and it has been found that the densification property of silicon nitride, sintered under atmospheric pressure, is very inferior. therefore, it has been considered important to employ high pressure when a product of good strength is desired. this is commonly referred to as "hot pressing" of silicon nitride. however, in spite of the use of hot pressing, the bend strength of simple ski#;4 has not been as high as desired at high temperatures. accordingly, other avenues of strength improvement have been sought such as through the use of additives which operate as a low temperature liquid phase to facilitate densification and not significantly imparing the creep resistance of the ceramic body at high temperatures. these added materials have included relatively large amounts of chromium oxide, zinc oxide, nickel oxide, titanium oxide, cerium oxide, magnesium oxide, yttrium oxide and others, ranging in excess of 2owb (wt.) of the matrix material. silicon nitride with these particular additives tends to form a structure having a strength level which does not usually exceed 50 ksi at high temperatures. in one instance (u.s. patent 3,830,652 to gala) did the prior art obtain strength levels in excess of 50 ksi. in this instance, the concern was for physical characteristics useful for turbine elements: hardness, oxidation resistance (inertness) and transverse rupture strength. gaza explored metal oxide additives to a ski?4 system which ranged in amounts related solely to machine element usage. the additions were added in amounts up to 20, < . however, commercial cutting tools today exhibit the same or better physical properties that were the focus of gaza's work. for example, commercial a1203 or tic tools have excellent hardness at high temperature, high resistance to oxidation and transverse rupture strengths at high temperatures which range up to 100,000 psi. strength is considered the most important feature because of the necessity to withstand forces imposed on the tool material by the tool fixture and by the resistance of the stock material, particularly at heavy depths of cutting. these forces become unusually exaggerated when cutting ferrous material such as cast iron at high speeds and feeds. without increased strength, it is believed by those skilled in the art that further improvements in tool life cannot be achieved. since the strength level of si 4 is equal to or lower than commercial materials now available, it has been rejected as a tool material with little hope in improving tool life. in only one known instance has the art attempted to employ
