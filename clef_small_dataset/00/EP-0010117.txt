<ABSTRACT>
a pilot operated relief valve has a main relief valve (10)  and a pilot relief valve (31) connected between a control  chamber (23) and drain.  a restriction (16) connects the control  chamber (23) to the inlet chamber (22) which is separated  from the control chamber by a piston (24) integral with the  main relief valve closure member (12).  thus opening of the  pilot relief valve against the adjustable force of a spring (14)  determines the maximum pressure in the inlet chamber (22).   the control chamber (23) can also be connected to drain (70)  by a pilot valve (19) which is operated by a force motor (52)  against pressure in a feedback chamber (56) connected to the  inlet passage (22).  the energisation of the force motor (52) can  be adjusted to adjust the relief pressure to a value below that  at which the pilot relief valve (31) opens.  alternatively the  pressure in the feedback chamber (56) can depend on the  pressure at least one side of a load fed via a directional valve  from the inlet passage (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
description "improvements in or relating to pressure relief valves". the present invention relates to relief valves for fluids and more particularly to a pilot operated relief valve having a fluid-pressure operated main relief valve and a pilot valve for controlling the fluid pressure for operating the main relief valve commonly, a piston integrally formed with the main relief valve closure member is subjected on one side to the pressure in the inlet chamber (i.e. to the pressure to be relieved or controlled) and on the other side to the pressure in a control chamber. the inlet chamber is connected to the control chamber via a restriction and the control chamber is connectible to drain via a pilot relief valve when the desired pressure in the inlet chamber is reached, the pilot relief valve opens and the resulting fluid flow through the restriction creates a pressure drop across the piston, whereby the main relief valve is opened to connect the inlet chamber to the outlet chamber which is normally connected to drain. in the pilot operated relief valve described in british patent no. 1 109 261, the pilot relief valve is opened by the pressure in the control chamber acting against a spring and against the pressure in a back pressure chamber (the outlet chamber of the pilot relief valve). the spring force may be manually adjustable but to provide for the possibilfty cf remote control, a bleed path extends from a fluid supply, e.g. the source of the pressure to be relieved or controlled, to drain and comprises a second restriction and a servo valve operated by an electrical torque motor the junction of the second restriction and the servo valve is connected to the back pressure chanber so that the second restriction lies in parallel with the pilot relief valve. when the servo valve is opened by the application of an electrical signal to the torque motor, the pressure in- the back pressure chamber is reduced, whereby the opening pressure of the pilot relief valve, and thereby of the main relief valve is reduced. it is to be noted that, in the event of failure of the electrical circuitry, the - servo valve will remain closed so that the inlet pressure wili not be limited unless a separate safety relief valve is provided. an object of the invention is to provide a remotely controllable relief valve which opens at a relatively low or minimum pressure in the event of absence of a control ling electrical signal. according to the present invention, a pressure relief value comprises a piston operated main relief valve, one side of the piston being exposed to the inlet pressure and the other side being exposed to a control chamber which is itself connected to the junction between a restriction leading frcm a pressure source, e.g. the source of the pressure to be controlled, and a pilot valve leading to drain and an electrical force motor for actuating the pilot valve against p fluid pressure produced
