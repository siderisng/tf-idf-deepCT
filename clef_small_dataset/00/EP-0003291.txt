<ABSTRACT>
1.  an apparatus for the blast-cleaning of the wall surfaces of pipes (r) brought by means of conveyor devices (17, 18, 19) and placed in succession on a frictional rotary bearing (16) with blasting devices (1, 2) arranged in front of the two orifices of the pipes (r) with guide tubes (1a, 2a) which are directed toward the interior of the pipes (r) and of which the orifices are at an adjustable distance from the orifices of the pipes (r) and with a lifting and onward conveying device (21 to 25) for the already blasted pipes (r), characterized in that the blasting devices (1, 2) are arranged rigidly on or in a closed blasting chamber (3) accommodating the frictional rotary bearings (16) for the pipes (r) and the collecting and discharge devices (3c, 8, 9) for the blasting medium, and the guide tubes (1a, 2a) are designed so as to be adjustable in length and cross-section.
