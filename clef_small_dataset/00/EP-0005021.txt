<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for providing a continuous supply of web  material to a web printer or other system.  it is necessary to  achieve this so that a printing operation, for example, may  continue in uninterrupted fashion even as successive rolls of  printing paper or other web material are depleted.  the web  material is fed from a first roll (36) supported in a feed  position, and when the first roll is near depletion, the leading  end of a second roll (36) is adhesively connected to the web  of the first roll with that web then being severed.  one belt  drive means (48) is employed for rotating both the forward  and rearward rolls so that these achieve the same speed for  the connecting and severing operations.  the belt drive  means are connected to the press drive through control  means (73) which vary the belt drive speed in accordance  with the tension of the web.  an indexing conveyor (30, 32)  supports forward and rearward rolls to locate the rolls in the  forward and rearward running positions and in intermediate  positions for connecting and severing of the web material  and for loading of new rolls into the system.
