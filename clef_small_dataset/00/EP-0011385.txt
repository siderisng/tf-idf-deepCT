<ABSTRACT>
a mounting device for shallow channel section plates  has an elongate base strip (10) from which project a series of  heads (12), each head comprising a pair of outwardly convex  elements (14).  the plate can be clipped resiliently onto any  two mutually outwardly convex elements (14).  grooves (24)  are provided between adjacent heads (12) so that the base  strip can be broken to suit the overall width of the plate or  plates being mounted.  end spacer elements (28) are proÂ­ vided for accurately positioning two strips end-to-end.  the  spacer element (28) can be broken away if not required.  one  or more strips (10) may be slidably carried in a channel  member (32) mounted to a support.  alternatively the strips  (10) can be screwed directly to a support through slightly  elongate holes (26) between each pair of elements (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
mounting device for plates this invention relates to mounting plates, for example sign plates, to a support such as a wall. more particularly it is concerned with plates which are of shallow channel cross-section, having rearwardly directed flanges with mutually convergent portions on their facing surfaces. in my u.k. patent no. 1,532,995 i described a mounting device for such plates in the form of an elongate base strip having a plurality of heads projecting therefrom uniformly spaced along the strip, each head comprising a spaced pair of elements having mutually divergent portionsontheir surfaces remote from each other, whereby plates, whose flanges are spaced apart by a multiple of the unit centre-to-centre spacing of adjacent heads, can be resiliently push-fitted onto the strip which extends at right angles to direction of extension of the plates. the present invention provides a development of this device which is more versatile and more easily employed. the present invention provides a mounting device for use in mounting to a support surface a plate which is provided with rearwardly directed flanges having mutually convergent portions on their facing surfaces, the device comprising an elongate base strip for securing to a said support and having a plurality of heads projecting therefrom uniformly spaced apart along the strip, each head comprising a spaced pair of elements having mutually divergent portions on their surfaces remote from each other, whereby a said plate can be mounted to the device by resiliently pushing the plate flanges over two said elements on the strip, the mutually convergent portions of the flanges being retained by the mutually divergent portions of the elements; characterised in that the strip has lines of weakening between adjacent heads whereby portions of the strip having one or more complete heads can be broken therefrom. preferably the strip is provided at its ends with a spacer element, whereby when a strip end is mounted end-to-end with a broken-off portion of a strip, with the spacer element abutting the edge formed by the fracture at the line of weakening, the spacing of the adjacent heads on either side of the join is the same as the uniform spacing of the heads along a strip. the spacer element is preferably connected to the strip by a line of weakening, whereby it can be broken away when not required for spacer purposes. preferably, an aperture is provided in the base strip between each pair of head-forming elements. the aperture is desirably elongate in the longitudinal direction of the strip. the strip preferably extends at each longitudinal side beyond the heads to provide side flanges. there may be provided a channel member into which the base strip or a broken-off part thereof is longitudinally slidable, the side flanges being retained by inturned lips at the mouth of the channel, the heads projecting through the mouth of the channel, whereby the channel can be mounted to the said support, and one or more clips each comprising a strip or a portion of a said
