<ABSTRACT>
In the method for producing laterally isolated silicon regions in a silicon body are etched by means of reactive lonid etching in compliance with defined pressures, concentrations of the reactive gas, power densities and etching speeds and using a mask of SiO₂ grooves, which rejuvenate with the depth and have a flat bottom . Then, by means of a thermal oxidation, the grooves are coated with a thin SiO₂ layer, and then SiO₂ is separated all the surface in a thickness determined by the groove width, the grooves being completely filled. Finally, the SiO₂ applied outside the grooves is etched away. If the silicon body contains a highly doped layer, which is etched in the formation of the grooves, an entertainment is prevented by working in the reactive loner etching at a particularly low overall pressure and / or a particularly low concentration of the reactive gas. In the isolated silicon regions, for example, bipolar transistors, field effect transistors and resistors can be formed.
