<ABSTRACT>
a capacitive pressure sensor includes at least one stationary  substrate (201a, 201b) and a diaphragm (202) having a  portion movable with respect to the substrate, a pressure  chamber (205a, 205b) being defined between the diaphragm  and the at least one substrate and filled with a fluid exposed to  the pressure to be detected.  the diaphragm (203) is formed of  silicon as an electrically conductive material, thus serving as  one electrode of the capacitive sensor.  the opposite electrode  or electrodes (202a, 202b) are plated on the surfaces of the  substrate or substrates facing the diaphragm, when the substrate  or substrates are made of insulating material such as  borosilicate glass, quartz, soft glass or sapphire.  in this case,  the diaphragm is directly bonded to the substrate or substrates.  in an alternative, the substrate or substrates are also  formed of silicon, thus themselves forming the opposite electrode  or electrodes of the capacitive sensor.  in this case, spacers  of insulating material such as borosilicate glass, quartz,  soft glass or sapphire, are bonded between the diaphragm  and the substrate or substrates.
