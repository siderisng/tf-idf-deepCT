<ABSTRACT>
a pipe coating composition is provided having good  crack resistance properties that consists essentially of  about 50 to 70 wt. % mineral aggregate, about 15 to 35 wt. %  finely divided mineral filler, about 5 to 20 wt. % asphalt, about  0. 05 to 7 wt. % of a rubbery radial teleblock copolymer, about  0 to 7 wt. % of an oil, and about 0 to 0. 5 wt. % of a fibrous  material.  furthermore, the crack resistance of a pipe coating  composition is dramatically improved by using an asphalt  rubber composition in which the rubber is an epoxy-coupled  radial teleblock copolymer as compared to a silicon  tetrahalide-coupled radial teleblock copolymer of essentially  the same structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
asphalt and rubber comprising composition t@is invention relates to ruber asphalt mixtures. more specifically, this invention relates to a composition of watter useful as a pipe coating. furthermore, this invention relates to a process of coating a pipe. background of the invention natal pipes are subjected to corrosion. particularly when they are laid in the ground or in water. it has been described in the art that such pipes can be protected fro this corrosion by a protecting coating of asphalt, coated in turn with concrete. such a coating not only renders the pipe heavy and is difficult to be put on the pipe joint, but the coating is not sufficiently flexible so that cracking may occur during the pipe laying. an improved technique known in the art provides for a protective coating for pipes that comprises asphalt, sand, limestone dust and asbestos or glass fiber fillers. whereas such a coating ie reported to be more flexible than a concrete coating, it would be desirable to have a coating material available with still further improved crack resistance. the invention it is thus one object of this invention to provide a coating composition with good cracking resistanca. another object of this invention is to provide a coated pipe with good crack-resistant properties of the coating. a further.object of this invention is to provide a process for coating a pipe with Ã¥a protective coating in order to reduce the corrosion of such 8 pipe when laid in the ground or under water. these and other objects, details, advantages, embodiments and features of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the invention and the appended claims. in accordance with this invention, we have now found that a composition of matter consisting essentially of mineral aggregates, finely divided mineral filler, asphalt, a rubbery radial teleblock copolymer, and optionally oil and fibrous material can be used for coating pipes and said composition exhibits advantageous resistance against cracking. more specifically, the composition of matter that is provided in accordance with this invention consists of the ingredients listed above within the weight percentage ranges shown in the following table. this table also shows the preferred range of the weight percentages of the individual ingre dint. weight percent ingreedient range preferred range mineral aggregate 50-70 55-65 finely divided mineral filler 15-35 20-30 emi2.1 <tb> asphalt <sep> 1 <tb> rubbery <sep> radial <sep> teleblock <sep> copolymer <sep> # <sep> <sep> 5-20 <sep> 8-15 <tb> oil <tb> fibrous material 0-05 0.1-0.5 in the following by the term "rubber", the rubbery radial teleblock copolymer is meant. this "rubber" comprises ns one of the mononers an alkadiene. as a general rule fibrous material is utilized in the composition of this lnvention in an amount of 0.05 to 0.5 wt. 2 and as pointed out above in the table, most preferably in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 wt. z. it is generally desirable to employ 1 to 20 parts by weight rubber,
