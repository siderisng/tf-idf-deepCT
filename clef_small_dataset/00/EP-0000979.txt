<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle having a rigid axle connected to the vehicle  chassis by link assemblies each comprising a first link (24,  44, 50) connected at an end of the axle and an upper,  second, link (25, 40, 51) pivoted at one end to the chassis,  the other ends of the two links being pivoted together.   spring means (35) acts on the second link at a position  to give a displacement of the spring means in roll of between  75 and 125% of its displacement in bump.  the upper  link may be triangulated in an assembly to provide for  pivoting of its connection with the first link about an axis  (33) inclined to the vehicle centre line.
