<ABSTRACT>
by the process of this invention, two-layer printed  circuits having conductive interconnections are prepared  by applying a photoadhesive layer to a substrate bearing  an electrically conductive circuit pattern, exposing the  photoadhesive layer to a circuit image related to a circuit  pattern to produce adherent circuit image areas having  segments overlying the circuit pattern, applying metal  powder to the adherent image areas, exposing the resultant  image areas to an image of the overlying segments,  removing the overlying segment areas of the phtoadhesive  layer with a suitable solvent, and soldering or  plating the resultant image areas to form an electrically  conductive pattern interconnected with the underlying  circuit pattern.
