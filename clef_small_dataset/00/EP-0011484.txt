<ABSTRACT>
metals are removed from aqueous or organic solution  by contacting the solution with a product, derived from an  inorganic oxide containing surface hydroxyl groups, e. g. ,  silica, containing groups of general formulae (i) and/or (ii).   r is a divalent radical containing up to 20 carbon atoms,  r¹ and r² are halogen atoms, organic radicals containing up  to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrolysis products thereof, m is a  metallic or hydrogen ion and (a) is an integer corresponding  to the valency of m.  suitable metals for removal include copper, silver,  rhodium, lead, uranium, palladium, cobalt and mercury.  the process may be used to recover wanted metals or to  remove contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
removal of metals from solution the present invention relates to the removal of metals from solution and in particular to the removal of calcium, iron, copper, rhodium, silver, mercury and uranium from solution. as a result of previous refining processes, traces of copper are sometimes present in distillate fuels such as automotive and aviation gasolines and aviation kerosines. copper is undesirable because it is an oxidation catalyst which promotes the formation of gums and resins which affect the performance of an engine. it is current practice to combat the adverse effect of copper by adding a copper deactivator to the fuel. when mercury is employed in processing operations it is necessary owing to its toxic nature to reduce to a minimum the quantities that are discharged to the environment in whatever form, including liquid effluents that are discharged to water courses. this is of particular importance in the manufacture of chlorine and caustic soda by the electrolysis of brine in mercury cathode electrolytic cells where the depleted brine leaving the cells contains a small concentration of mercury, usually between 2 and 10 mg/litre, either in the form of elemental mercury or mercury compounds. if this depleted brine is discharged to waste the value of the lost mercury is significant and the receiving water course may be polluted with mercury compounds to an unacceptable level. in the photographic industry it is desirable on economic grounds to remove and recover silver from residue other situations in which it is desirable or essential to remove soluble metal ions from solution include the softening of water, i.e., the removal of calcium ions, and the hydrometallurgical processing of mineral ores and metal concentrates. our co-pending british patent application no. 35566/78 (bp case no. 4620) discloses a process for the production of a product derived from an inorganic oxide containing surface hydroxyl groups, containing groups of general formula (i) and/or 1it): emi2.1 wherein r is a diva lent radical containing up to 20 carbon 1 2 atoms, k and/or r are nalogen atoms, organic radicals containing up to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrolysis products thereof, m is a metallic or hydrogen ion and (a) is an integer corresponding to the valency of m. suitable inorganic oxides containing surface hydroxyl groups include alumina, titania, zirconia, glass, sepiolite and zeolitic molecular sieve. preferably the inorganic oxide is silica and more preferably silica gel. in addition, mixtures of inorganic solids may be used. unless they have been subjected to severe treatment, e.g., heating above iooo0c, commercial silicas contain surface hydroxyl groups. r1 and/or r2 in the compounds of formulae (i) and/or (ii) may be halogen atoms, alkyl, aryl, aryloxy or alkoxy radicals or hydrolysis products thereof, and may be the same or different. preferably r1 and/or r2 are alkoxy groups containing 1-3 carbon atoms or hydrolysis products thereof. most preferably the are identical groups. r is preferably an alkylene group containing up to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably a di- or tri-methylene group. we have now discovered that this
