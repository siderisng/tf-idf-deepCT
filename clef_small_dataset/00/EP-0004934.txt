<ABSTRACT>
the plant is a tank (10) forming an aeration chamber in  which waste water is treated with active sludge and is  aerated, and which has mounted therein a plate insert (24)  defining an upwardly open secondary sedimentation chamber  having inclined side walls and an overflow for purified  waste water (40) as well as a bottom opening (25) through  which precipitated sludge flows back to the aeration chamber.   two vertical plates (31) define a central channel in the  plate insert, said channel being in communication with the  aeration chamber through tubes (32) and causing auxiliary  currents to be generated in the tubes and the lower portion  of the plate insert, said currents contributing towards  keeping the bottom opening free from accumulations of  sludge.

<DESCRIPTION>
tne invention relates to a plant for biological purification of waste water, said plant comprising an aeration chamber in which the waste water is mixed with active sludge and is aerated through immersed diffusers, and a secondary sedimentation chamber in which the slidge is precipitated and from which the purified water flows away through an overflow, and which is defined by an upwardly open plate insert mounted in an aeration tank, said plate insert having bottom and side walls inclining downwrdly towards a bottom opening. in operation of such a plant, the sludge precipitated in the secondary sedimentation chamber slides down the ln- clined bottom and side walls of the plate insert, out through the bottom opening and back to the aeration chamber however, sludge may accumulate at the bottom of the secon- dary y sedimentation chamber, which more or less clings the bottom opening and impedes the operation of the plant. this drawback is overcome by the plant of the invention where a central charnel is defined in the plate insert between two substantially vertical, parallel plates extending between the end plates of the insert and substantially from their upper edges to a level spaced somewhat from the bottom opening, said central channel being connected to the aeration chamber through a plurality of tubes. this construction causes auxiliary currents to be generated in the portion of the plate insert which is located below said tubes, said auxiliary currents contributing towards making the sludge present on the lower portions of the inclined walls of the insert slide down these walls without accumulating over the bottom opening and clogging fully or ach of tl form an essentially closed path extending upwardly from tne bottom opening of the insert through the space between sne of the inclined walls of the insert and the tank wall, in through the tubes and down through the central channel and the lower portion of the insert to its bottom opening. are plant of the invention is further characterized by the provision of an outlet chamber which is defined at one end of the central channel by means of transverse walls an a bottom wall, said outlet chamber being connected to an outlet channel and receiving purified water which overflows the secondary sedimentation chamber formed by the plate insert, and having mounted therein a diffusor for oxidizing the water. this construction has the advantage that the purified water s oxidized so effectively before it leaves the plant that it 5 not required to provide a separate, subsequent oxidizing plant. the invention will be explained more fully below with reference to the drawing, in which 1 shows a vertical section of an embodiment of the plant according to the invention, fig. 2 shows 2 horizontal section taken along the line ii-ii in fig. 1, and fig. 3 is a perspective view of a detail of the plant. in the drawing 10 is a cylindrical tank, which is dug into the ground and consists of a bottom 11 of
