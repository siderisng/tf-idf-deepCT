<ABSTRACT>
an inorganic material akin to imogolite is synthesised.   imogolite is a natural product having tubular structure and  occurs in some soils.  the synthetic product has tubes of 13 -  17% greater diameter, and is made thus:   prepare an aqueous hydroxyaluminium silicate solution  containing up to 0. 5 molar aluminum and of ph 3. 1 to 5. 0 by  acid-hydrolysing aluminium alkoxides and (introduced not  earlier than the alkoxide) tetraalkyl silicate.  the atomic prop­ ortion of si: al is up to 0. 6:1.  the solution thus prepared is digested, say at 96°c for a  day, until a product is obtained displaying discernible electron  diffraction peaks at 1. 4å, 2. 1å and 4. 2å.
