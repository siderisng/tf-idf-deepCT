<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the preparation of useful materials, comprising a liquid fuel, from solid waste comprising a biomass, this process consisting in subjecting the waste to separation, in subjecting the biomass to grinding and then to the action of acid hydrolysis at a sufficient temperature and pressure for the organic part of the waste to be substantially solubilised and converted to fermentescible sugars, and in fermenting the resulting product in order to cause the formation of alcohol and the production of residues for use as a nutrient, characterised in that : a) the hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of sulphurous acid as the hydrolysis catalyst ; b) the resulting fermented product is filtered in order to separate off a filtrate and a residue ; and c) the filtrate is distilled, in a manner which is in itself known, in order to obtain a liquid fuel and a residue.
