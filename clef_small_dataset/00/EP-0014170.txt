<ABSTRACT>
1.  divided plate for hives with a view to feeding the bees with liquid or eventually solid food, the solid or liquid food being placed in distinctive side-to-side compartments (1, 4, 30, 45, 46, 58) accessible for the bees by an opening in the base, and being closed by a movable slide door for the solid food, and by a through for the liquid food, the access to the trough being possible beneath, along and over a lath (5) which defines a trough lip and whose height is reduced with respect to the height of the plate in which it is placed, so as to permit the feeding of one to four colonies and characterized by the fact that : a) several troughs (13, 12, 31, 38, 54, 55) are provided for, contiguous to a common reservoir of liquid food ; they are grouped by twos, aligned on one or the two opposite sides of the reservoir (4, 30, 58), and they are equally provided with an upper access, at least a pair of troughs being disposed on one side of the plate, the lateral and outwars ends of the troughs being located on the sides of the plate at right angle to the above mentionned side ; b) each trough is provided on its upper and lower access, respectively with movable slide door (19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28) whose selective handling permits the checking of the access to the trough either from the upper hive or from the lower one or even the exchanges between hives, these movable slides being operated from outside the hive on the abovementionned perpendicular sides of the plate ; c) on these very perpendicular sides, there is a slanted conduit (6) used as a lodging for a removable syrup-guide, shaped like a drawer (7) meant for the refilling of the reservoir.
