<ABSTRACT>
a multiple spindle honing machine includes automatically  controlled feed cylinders (66a - 66h) for initially expanding  honing tools driven by the spindles (40a - 40h) and also  includes a constant rate feed mechanism (70) that continues  to expand the tools after the initial tool expansion actuated by  the feed cylinders (66a - 66h).  each spindle (40a - 40h) includes  a connector (68) that extends between one of the feed cylinders  (66a - 66h) and its associated honing tool.  mechanical  locks (178a - 178h) respectively lock the feed cylinders (66a -  66h) after the initial tool expansion.  the constant rate feed  mechanism (70) continues tool expansion after the feed cylinders  (66a - 66h) are locked.  electrical and hydraulic circuits  control operation of the pressure feed cylinders (66a - 66h),  the constant rate feed mechanism (70), and the mechanical  locks (178a - 178h).  each honing tool is automatically contracted  independently of the other tools after the respective  bore being machined reaches the required size and, after all  the tools are contracted, the feed cylinders (66a - 66h) may be  actuated to re-expand the tools for a finishing operation.
