<ABSTRACT>
control unit adjustable interlock apparatus in a con­ trol unit which includes a housing (6) through which a  rotatable and axially movable shaft (4) projects has a  collar (70) located in the housing (6) which collar (70)  surrounds the shaft (4) and which has a notch (100)  capable of being engaged by engaging means (80) asso­ ciated with a member (78) rotatable with the shaft (4) to  interlock the shaft.  the collar (70) has a section which  has serrations (110) which enable the collar (70) to be  fitted on to a retainer plate (72) in a plurality of positions.  the invention enables the sahft of the unit to be selec­ tively interlocked and also makes it possible for the collar to  be adjusted relative to the retaining plate so that the po­ sition where the interlock becomes effective is also ad­ justable.

<DESCRIPTION>
control unit adjustable interlock apparatus this invention relates to a control unit adjustable interlock apparatus in which the control unit includes a housing rotatably supporting a shaft. control units such as those used in marine applications are conveniently controlled with a single lever control handle. this handle or lever is used selectively to engage forward or reverse gear and to control the throttle setting. - it is useful if the throttle setting can be operated independently of the gear setting when this is neutral and this can be achieved by allowing axial movement of the shaft to disengage the throttle control from the gearing. it is necessary to provide suitable interlock arrangements to ensure that the various components of the control unit cannot be operated unless they are correctly positioned and it is an object of the present invention to achieve this. it is also convenient to allow the interlock and the handle to be able to be positioned in any one of a number of positions according to the convenience of operation for a person controlling the unit and it is also an object of the invention to provide a unit which has provision for this. examples of pertinent patents are united states patent nos. 2,254,144; 3,126,785; 3,511,117; 3,581,603; 3,842,695 and 3,929,039. in us patent 3,842,695, the lever and shaft are not capable of axial movement, but a slider shaft in the lever assembly can be retracted. when the transmission is in the neutral position, retraction of the slider shaft disengages key 96 having projection 100 from the driving gear 56, and pulls pin 108 into hole 110. us patent 3,581,603 discloses a similar mechanism. us patent 3,842,695 differs from the invention in several ways; first, the lock is on the slider shaft, not the lever; second, the slider shaft is non-rotatable; third, the lock is not spring biased. in us patent 3,581,603 the slider shaft is rotatable. us patents 3,511,117 and 3,127,785 disclose control levers which can be pulled outward when in neutral position, to open the throttle independently of the shift function. the control lever is spring biased. in us patent 3,511,117, blocking flange 134 locks curved portion 133 against reverse of interlocking plate 131 to prevent accidental shift while in the neutral throttle mode. lateral wings 135 or 136 are interposed between the blocking flange 134 and gear 38 to prevent axial translation of the control lever 18 except in the neutral position. us patent 3,127,785 has a similarly functioning plate 70 and flange 37. the lever in patent 3,929,039 contains a spring-loaded coupling shaft which can be disengaged while the lever is in a neutral position. the coupling shaft has radially extending pins 25 which couple the main shaft to the throttle gear. pressing in the coupling shaft against the spring disengages the pins from the gear, and the gear from the shaft. in operation, this mechanism functions in the reverse manner from the present invention. many problems remain in the prior art devices. one
