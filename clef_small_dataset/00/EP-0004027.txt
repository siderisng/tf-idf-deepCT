<ABSTRACT>
container for the transport and consumption of pizza and  food in general, consisting of a cover equipped with a small  peripheral step (5) of same cover under the upper level (7) of  the rim (8); this step is interrupted at constant angular intervals  by niches (9) tapered towards the bottom, which end at  the bottom of the container; these niches are intercalated with  analogous niches (14) of inferior depth compared to that of  the niches (9), limited by the level (13) and of such dimensions  that they consent the outer walls of the niches (9) to fit into the  inner part of the niches (14): the step (5) and the niches (9, 14)  are protruding towards the outside compared with the walls  (4) of the cover.  once arranged the food at the inside of the container, it is  possible to place a lid (17) on it, the projections (18) of which  come to lean on the bottom levels (13) of the niches (14), or it is  possible to place another container on it, resting the bottom of  the niches (9) on the levels (13) a. s. o.  when empty, the containers fit closely into each other  with a minimum of encumberment as to height, as their  niches (9) are in correspondence.
