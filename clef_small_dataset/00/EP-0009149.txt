<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to a collecting piece (1) for a milking product, wherein a plurality, in particular four leads (17-20), are provided for connection with each a milking cup. The ends of these leads each lead in a common first sliding surface of the Sam molding. Against the first sliding surface is sealingly a second sliding surface. Furthermore, a number of derivatives (12-15) corresponding to the number of allowances is present, whose beginnings are each in the second sliding surface and enforce them. The first and second sliding surfaces are rotatable against each other or sliding bar and the ends of the leads are arranged in such a way with respect to the beginnings of the derivations, that in a first position of the two sliding surfaces, the ends of all leads are directed with the beginnings of all derivatives and that In a second position of the two sliding surfaces, the second sliding surface closes the ends of all to leads and the first sliding surface the beginnings of all from lines.
