<ABSTRACT>
The casserole wheel brake is equipped with two brake shoes (2 and 3 in servo assembly. The first brake shoe (2) operative on forward traveling is mounted on two guide rollers (9, 10). The guide role Len (9 and 10) are on a carrier (6). The carrier (6) is spreadable by a cam (8) acting in the direction of the first brake jaw (2) against the brake drum (1). The first brake jaw (2) is in its support range on the guide rollers (9 and 10) provided with climbing train (11 and 12), which include with the outer curvature of the brake jaw (2) in each case a wedge surface tapered in the opening direction. The second brake pad (3) is supported on the one hand on a fixed abutment (4) and via a bolt (5) deposit at the other end of the second brake shoe (3) of the carrier (6) and the first brake shoe (2). By tensioning the cam (8), the carrier (6) is spreading against the brake drum (1) and shifted in circumstance. There For the first brake shoe (2) loses the immediate contact with the bolt (5). By friction between the brake shoe (2) and the brake drum (1), the brake jaw (2) is taken in the direction of rotation, while the brake jaw (2) moves via the clamping paths (11 and 12) along the guide rollers (9 and 10). This has the consequence that the brake jaw (2) corresponding to the wedge shape of the climb webs (11 and 12) with high force to the brake drum (1) is pressed.
