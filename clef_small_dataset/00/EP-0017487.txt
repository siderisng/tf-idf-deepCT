<ABSTRACT>
a shuttlecock comprising a cap portion and a plastics  skirt in the form of a truncated conical lattice structure having  main stems interconnected by ribs with further intermediate  stems located between the main stems, the lattice structure  in the vicinity of the wide end of the skirt being convoluted  with the flutings extending at an acute angle, preferably 45Â°  to the longitudinal axis of the shuttlecock, and being so  orientated as to make the shuttlecock spin and otherwise  behave as a feathered shuttlecock.  preferably, slots or slits are provided in the skirt at its  wide end and the convolutions extend approximately from  one end of one slot to the opposite end of an adjacent slot.   the convolutions are formed by deforming the skirt material  inwardly and this has the effect of slightly widening the slits  in the shuttlecock.  although preferred, the ribs, at least at the wide end of  the skirt, need not be provided, and could be replaced by  plastics flumes.

<DESCRIPTION>
"shuttie th is invention relates to shuttlecocks made of plastics material most commercially acceptable plastics shuttlecocks comprise a skirt portion attached to a cap portion, e.g. of cork or rubber, the skirt portion comprising a truncated conical plastics lattice structure made up of main stems extending axially and radially outwardly from a circular base at the narrow end of the skirt, the main stems being connected together by circumferentially extending ribs and in some cases being separated by one or more subsidiary stems. although feathered shuttlecocks are still preferred to plastics shuttlecocks because of their flight characteristics, they are extremely expensive, and hence, plastics shuttlecocks are now often used.. in order to obtain a flight as true as possible to that of a feather shuttlecock, one of the essential features is that the plastics shuttlerock, when in flight, spins. one way in which we have achieved spinning of plastics shuttlecocks is to stop the lattice t ructure short of the base and provide main stems only between the base and the lattice structure, these main stems having blades or flanges on their inner faces which are preferably non-radial and are so orientated that they produce spinning of the shuttlecock as it passes through the air. the presence of these blades or flanges give the main stems either a t-shaped or l-shaped or inverted l-shaped cross-section. what is more, the blade or flange of the l or t may extend obliquely relative to the base of the l or to the cross member of the t to assist with spinning. another feature which we have introduced into plastics shuttlecocks to assist with spinning is to make the main stems, at least where they form part of the lattice structure, slightly curved in the form of a helix, the helical stems standing slightly proud of the remainder of the lattice structure internally and/or externally. a further feature sshich we have introduced into our plastics shuttlecocks to assist with stability and/or spinning of the shuttlecock during flight is to provide slots or slits at the wide end of the skirt or lattice structure, said slots or slits extending parallel to the main stems and big located adjacent the main stems. it is vvital for all the features of a plastics shuttlecock wiilch impart spin to the shuttlecock lo act in a complementary fashion, and a shuttlecock having the above features is disclosed in our british patent no. 1,4297713. it is the aim of the majority of manufacturers of shuttlecocks utilizing plastics skirt to simulate. exactly the flight characteristics of a feathered shuttlecock and with this in mind, we have now developed an improved shuttlecock. according to the present invention, we provide a shuttlecock comprising a cap portion i a plastics skirt, wherein the plastics skirt, adjacent its widest end, is of fluted construction, the flutings extending at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of the shuttlecock and being orientated so as to complement the spinning characteristics of the shuttlecock. -ry fluted, we
