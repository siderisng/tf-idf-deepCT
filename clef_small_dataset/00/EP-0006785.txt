<ABSTRACT>
Heating device of the cathode of a power tube, intended in particular, to avoid damaging the tube to the power on.The effective value of the heating current supplied to the cathode K of a tube T is controlled by thyristors D₁, D₂ whose aperture angle is set by the value of a voltage u.When igniting the tube this tension u part of the value O and progressively reaches, with a time constant given by the elements of the circuit, a value u₀ corresponding to a tube preheating speed;It remains at this value u₀ under the control of a G₂ relay or gradually reaches an upper um value, if the G₂ relay is not powered, thus progresses the cathode of the tube at its normal operating temperature.Application, in particular, to transmitters with power tubes.
