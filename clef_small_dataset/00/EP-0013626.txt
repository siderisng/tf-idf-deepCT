<ABSTRACT>
corrugated tubing (13) is advanced along its axial path  (a) by rotatably driven lead screw members (19) the screw  threading (20) of which is in meshing engagement with the  corrugations of the tubing (21), the lead screw members (19)  being in pairs with the screw threading (20) of the lead screw  members (19) of each pair being of opposite hand and the lead  screw members (19) of each pair being rotated in opposite  directions.  the lead screw members (19) of each pair present  outwardly directed cutters (36) which are synchronized subÂ­ stantially simultaneously to intersect the tubing (13) thereby,  in perforating the tubing (13), to restain the tubing (13)  against rotation thereof about the axial path (a).  a slide  member (56) is preferably slidably and non-rotatably  mounted by a splined connection (57) on each lead screw  member (19) with the associated cutter or cutters (36)  mounted on the slide member (56) for rotation therewith  during operative rotation of the lead screw member (19), the  slide member (56) being slidably moved along the lead screw  member (19) by the advancing tubing (13) during intersection  of tubing (13) by the associated cutter or cutters (36) with the  slide member (56) and associated cutter or cutters (36) being  returned to the initial position thereof between intersections  of the tubing (13) by the cutter or cutters (36).  there is also  disclosed a method of producing the lead screw members (19)  with the outwardly projecting cutters (36) mounted thereon.
