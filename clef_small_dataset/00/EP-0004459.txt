<ABSTRACT>
a device for joining panels or the like.  it is known in  the art to join panels to a framework by means of bolts,  screws or by bonding.  such arrangements have the disadvantage  that they are not weather proof and the time required  for construction is high.  in order to overcome these problems, the panels are  arranged to be resiliently gripped by the device, which  device comprises a first extrusion moulded member (10)  forming part of a first panel receiving means having a  flange (10c) which, in use, engages around the edge of a  panel.  an extrusion moulded member (18) also forming  part of said means, which is located relative to the first extrusion  moulded member by interengaging projection and  recess means (18a, 10f) arranged as a push fit, the extrusion  moulded gripping member having an edge (18c)  which abuts the panel.  the panel being resiliently gripped  between the flange and the edge.  a second panel being  retained by a second panel receiving means of the device.
