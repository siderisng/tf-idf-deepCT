<ABSTRACT>
the invention is concerned with a tannery primary  treatment process that, in total combination, or as separate  sub-process features, enables the reducing of bod loading  in such treatment, while increasing the efficiency of hexavalent  chrome recovery therefrom by separating out alkaline  sulfide solids from the normal unhairing beamhouse stage  and utilizing the same to attain appropriate sedimentation  tank sludge ph for oxidation of the chrome to the hexavalent  state during incineration; and/or increasing the  hexavalent chrome recovery by backwetting and roasting  the ash again; and/or enabling use of such ash for recycling  as a chrome tanning liquor with the side-production  of an improved flocculating chrome water wash for waste  treatment use.
