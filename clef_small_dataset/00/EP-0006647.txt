<ABSTRACT>
disposable absorbent structures comprising alternate  hydrophobic thermoplastic material and nonwoven  hydrophobic thermoplastic material, minimally bonded  together.  the outer layers of the structures are of absorb­ ent nonwoven material and the structures comprise at  least two such absorbent layers and at least one nonwoven  hydrophobic thermoplastic layer.  the hydrophobic  thermoplastic material may comprise one or more webs  of any appropriate polymer and of any structural form  having an open area sufficient to permit the free passage  of liquids therethrough.  the absorbent layers may com­ prise spunbonded rayon webs or webs of air laid, wet  laid or carded rayon fibers of staple length or longer, with  or without mechanical or hydraulic needling.  the outer  absorbent layers may also comprise stabilized rayon webs  and the inner absorbent plies, when the ultimate desired  characteristics of the absorbent structure will permit,  may be of other cellulosic materials such as layers of  tissue, fluff, wadding and the like.  the absorbent  structures demonstrate synergistic absorbency, excellent  wet and dry bulk, low lint discharge and a cloth-like  aesthetic primarily consisting of quietness and good hand,  including such attributes as drape, softness and flexibility.
