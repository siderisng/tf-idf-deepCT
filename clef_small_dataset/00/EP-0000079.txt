<ABSTRACT>
visual display of dental or other radiographic images is  realized with an x-ray tube (13) in which an electron beam  (23) is scanned through an x-y- raster is synchronism with  x-y-sweep signals of a cathode ray display tube (17).  the intensity signal for the display is derived from an  x-ray detector (44) receiving x-rays passing through an  object (12) to be imaged.  the detector (44) is arranged in a probe (14a) supported  relative to the x-ray tube (13) at any location and a plurality  of such probes (14a) of different configuration is provided to  change focal length, to accomodate to different detector  placements, to enhance patient comfort and to enable production  of both periapical, and wider angle pantomographic  dental images.  high image definition with reduced radiation  dosage may be provided for.  mounting means enable  changes of collimator (29a) in conjunction with changes of  the probe to change focal length.  a control circuit (16) modifies the x-y-sweep signals and  modulates electron beam to correct for image distortions.
