<ABSTRACT>
an ice cream cone having a sanitary paper jacket  adhered thereto which is sufficiently adherent for shipping,  handling and vending but which is selectively removable  without leaving jacket remnants thereon at the point of consumption.   a jacket is telescopically juxtaposed over the cone  after the jacket interior is dosed with water vapor or a vaporized  mixture of water and propylene glycol.  a conveyor (16)  for the cones (12), a timed dispenser (22, 24) and injector (28)  for the jackets (14) placing the latter alternately on the same  conveyor with the cones, a device (18) to combine each jacket  with a cone and an accumulator (32, 34) for the jacketed  cone product comprises the apparatus to practice the  method.
