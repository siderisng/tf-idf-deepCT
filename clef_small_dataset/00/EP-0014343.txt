<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of the calcium silica catgranules or powder with micropore structure Tur, which by reacting Kirstallinem and given alorphone silicon dioxide or this materials containing calcium oxide with calcium oxide with respect to this containing materials in a mole ratio of CaO to SiO₂, 0, 8: 1 to 1.1: 1 Under Homo, they narrow in water and shapes, autoclave harden. Drying and classifying with the extension that the homogenization in the reaction by dispersing agents of the solid starting materials in the water with the addition of a previously in water into a microporous stable foam anion-active surfactant substance has been obtained, as a constructing and adsorbent for Liquids, steam and gases, as well as calcium silicate granules of this type with further-forming additives, such as fatty amines, fatty amal zen and / or polyamide growth, as such.
