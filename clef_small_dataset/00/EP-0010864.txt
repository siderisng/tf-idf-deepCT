<ABSTRACT>
a gas-driven dental handpiece having vibration isolat­ ing means has a handle in two parts (25, 27).  a joint is  provided by a shaft (36) from the end of one part which  fits in a chamber (42) in the end of the other shaft, leaving  a small annular gap (43) between them which is occupied  by resilient o-rings (40, 41) or the like, under compression.   a small axial gap (35) is also provided between the parts  (25, 27) so that they are not in direct contact, and the o-­ rings (40, 41) provide a rigid joint while reducing the trans­ mission of vibration.  a pin (49) may be provided, normally  out of contact with one or other of the parts, to prevent  relative axial or rotational displacement of the parts.  the  joint may be provided elsewhere in the handpiece; for  example between the head and the handle.
