<ABSTRACT>
the invention is relating to a handwashing composition,  to a process for its preparation and to the application of such  composition, which is composed of the following primary  characterizing ingredients:   - a continuous oil phase, mainly consisting of straight or  branched paraffinic oil fractions of 10-30 carbon atoms, hav­ ing a boiling range between 140-400°c and a viscosity of up to  35 centistokes at 25°c;   - a dispersed aqueous phase;   - a buffer, mainly composed by lactic acid and  triethanolamine;   - an emulsifying system, mainly consisting of mono- and  diglycerides of the higher natural fatty acids and ethoxylated  glycerine esterified by fatty acids;   - glycerine as stabilizer of the emulsion;   - caraghenates such as polysaccharides bearing sulphonic  acid residues, optionally esterified by lower alcohols, and as  additional secondary components: allantoin, additional  stabilizers in the form of montmorillonites, the free oxygen  sites of which are occupied by quaternary groups, lower  alkanol, preservatives, silicone oils, antioxydants, perfumes,  desinfectants and an abrasive for special purposes.
