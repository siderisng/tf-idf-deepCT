<ABSTRACT>
With the specified method, extremely narrow dimensioned surface areas for semi-term arrangements can be formed, which have comparable minimalimensio nEN reduced dimensions compared to conventional photolithography methods, e.g. b. Lienenbrei th to the area <1 Î¼m. For this purpose, depressions are initially formed in the underlying position in the usual manner, so that substantially horizontal and substantially vertical surface areas (14, 16) are present. The order is then covered with a layer (18) covering the entire surface. This layer (18) is finally subjected to a reactive ion etching method in which the horizontal layer regions are supported and the layer regions remaining on the vertical surfaces of the UN rigging are left to provide an opening opposite to the original opening width. The method can be used for numerous substrates or documents common in semiconductor technology, e.g. b. For single-crystal line silicon substrates with or without epi axis seals or subcollorcan areas, for substrates covered by a layer of poly crystalline silicon with insulating simplicity or double layer or the like.
