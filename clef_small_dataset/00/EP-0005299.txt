<ABSTRACT>
disclosed are novel 1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1h-3-benzazepines  of the general formula i    wherein x is fluoro, chloro, bromo, trifluoromethyl or methyl  and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts  thereof.  the novel compounds may be prepared by methods  known per se.  preferably the compounds are prepared by  reacting a 7-x-8-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1h-3-benzazepine  with a mono- or disubstituted amine    whereby at least one of the reactants is in the form of a  reactive derivative and one of the reactants provides the  carbonyl group contained in the compound of formula i  between the r₁r₂n-group and the oxygen at position 8.  the novel compounds show neuroleptic, antidepressive  and antiagressive activity.
