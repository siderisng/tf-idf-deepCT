<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns parasiticidal heterocyclic ether  derivatives of the formula i:-    wherein w is the group   -zm-(cr¹r²)n-(chr³)p-[o-(chr⁴)q-(chr⁵)r-]s-   in which z is oxygen or sulphur, r¹, r², r³, and r⁴ and r⁵ are  independently chosen from hydrogen and c₁ to c₆ alkyl, m is 0  or 1, n, p, q, r and s are independently 0 or an integer from 1 to  6, provided that m is 0 when n and p are both 0, s is 0 when q  and r are both 0, and n + p + s(q + r) is not greater than 12; a, b,  d, e and v are independently chosen from the group consist­ ing of hydrogen, halogen, nitro, amino, cyano, hydroxy, mer­ capto, thiocyano, carboxy, formyl, c₂ to c₆ alkanoyl, (c₁ to c₆  alkoxy) carbonyl, c₁ to c₆ alkyl optionally substituted with one  or more substituents chosen from halogen, phenyl and c₁ to  c₆ alkoxy, c₁ to c₆ alkoxy optionally substituted with one or  more substituents chosen from halogen, phenyl and c₁ to c₆  alkoxy; c₂ to c₆ alkenyl optionally substituted with one or  more substituents chosen from halogen, phenyl and c₁ to c₆  alkoxy, phenyl optionally substituted with one or more sub­ stituents chosen from halogen, c₁ to c₆ alkyl, c₁ to c₆ alkoxy,  nitro and cyano, phenoxy optionally substituted with one or  more substituents chosen from halogen, c₁ to c₆ alkyl, c₁ to c₆  alkoxy, nitro and cyano, c₁ to c₆ alkylthio optionally substi­ tuted with one or more substituents chosen from halogen,  phenyl and c₁ to c₆ alkoxy, (c₂ to c₆ alkanoyl)amino, (c₁ to c₆  alkyl)amino and di(c₁ to c₆ alkyl)amino; f is chosen from  isothiocyano and nr⁶r⁷, wherein r⁶ is chosen from hydrogen  and c₁ to c₆ alkyl and r⁷ is chosen from hydrogen, c₁ to c₆  alkyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents  chosen from halogen, phenyl and c₁ to c₆ alkoxy, c₂ to c₆  alkenyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents  chosen from halogen, phenyl and c₁ to c₆ alkoxy, and the  group    --r⁸   in which y is oxygen or sulphur and r⁸ is chosen from c₁ to c₆  alkyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents  chosen from halogen, phenyl and c₁ to c₆ alkoxy, c₂ to c₆  alkenyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents
