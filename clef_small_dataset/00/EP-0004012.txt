<ABSTRACT>
1.  a door locking device for electrical apparatus, more especially for washing machines, comprising a housing (19) containing the control parts for preventing locking and for closing the current circuit (45, 47) of the apparatus together with the following features : 1.  there is longitudinally slidable supported on the housing (19) a closing plate (8) 1. 1 in which the door latching hook (1) engages when the door is closed 1. 2 which is movable into its locking end position against the force of a return spring (63) through closing of the door and 1. 3 the movement of which into the locking end position forms the control movement for blocking the movement of the closing plate, 2.  a locking slide (17) is supported within the housing (19) for longitudinal sliding movement at right angles to the direction of movement (7) of the closing plate (8), 2. 1 a locking projection (20) of said locking slide passing through an opening (22) in the wall of the housing, 2. 2 said locking projection (20) being movable into interlocking engagement with the closing plate (8) when the latter is in said locking end position to prevent movement thereof and 2. 3 there are likewise provided in the housing (19), for effecting longitudinal movement of the locking slide into its locking position, a bimetal element (51) which can be heated by the closing of a heating current circuit, and a control switch (15) responsive to closing of the door, 3.  a switch plunger (26) for closing the heating current circuit (47, 48) of the bimetal element (51) is slidably mounted in the housing (19) in the direction of movement of the closing plate (8) and has a projection (25) passing through the wall of the housing and interengaging with the closing plate (8) characterized by the following further features : 4.  the return spring (63) is within the housing (19) and acts upon the switch plunger (26) 5.  the closing plate (8) is located on the outer side of the base (21) of the housing, 5. 1 whereby the base (21) of the housing and the facing surface of the frame (4) of the apparatus respectively form guide surfaces acting upon the surfaces of the closing plate, 6.  the locking slide (17) is slidably supported parallel to the base (21) and its locking projection (20) is engageable in a locking groove (24) of the closing plate (8) which extends at right angles to the direction (7) of movement of the closing plate (8).
