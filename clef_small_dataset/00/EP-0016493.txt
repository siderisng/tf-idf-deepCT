<ABSTRACT>
a chlorinated polyethylene elastomer or resin is modified  by graft copolymerization with acrylic ester type of mono­ meric material, whose homopolymer has a glass transition  temperature of not greater than 6°c, in an amount sufficient to  provide an ester group (-coo-) content of from 25 to 40% by  weight, to yield a mixed copolymerizate vulcanizable to a heat  and oil resistant elastomeric state.

<DESCRIPTION>
elastomer with improved heat and oil resistance based on modified chlorinated polyethylene this invention pertains to chlorinated polyethylene that has been modified by graft polymerization with acrylic ester type monomeric material to provide an improved elastomer. the invention is especially directed to elastomers, which when properly compounded and vulcanized, are charac terlzed by superior resistance to the deteriorating effects of exposure to high temperature and to oil. more particularly this invention relates to ne vulcanizable elastomers which are mixed polymerizates of (a) a spine which is a chlorinated polyethylene polymer; and, (b) acrylic ester type monomeric material graft copolymerized in the presence of (a). optionally, there may also be graft copolymerized in the presence of (a) and (b) a small amount of (c) different additional ethylenically unsaturated monomeric material which serves to enhance the vulcanizability of the copolymerizate. there is a need for a rubber which has a wlde range of service temperatures, for example, over the range of -250f to 3500f. conventional butadiene-acrylonitrile, epichlorohydrin and chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubbers have good to moderate oil swell properties but their maximum servlce temperatures are generally under 300 f. ever-rising temperatures under the hoods of automotive vehicles and other developments in the mechanical goods field have created a demand for more satisfactory high temperature and oil resistant rubbers. acrylate rubbers have these properties but their low temperature flexibility is poor and processing is often difficult; compression set (an important property for seals and mechanical goods) of acrylate rubbers is often too high certain known rubbers made by free radical high temperature and high pressure copolymerization of ethylene and methyl acrylate with small amounts of acrylic acid have good high temperature resistance (up to 3500f) and oil swell resistance (6op volume swell when immersed for 3 days in astm no. 3 oil at 3000f), but the usefulness of these products is known to be limited because of their low viscosity, low green strength, as well as stickiness on the mill and tendency to stick in the mold thus making demolding difficult. the present invention is concerned with ameliorating the disadvantages of the various just-described prior art specialty rubbers. u. s. patent 3,622,652, hamed et al., nov. 23, 1971, discloses grafting of certain acrylates and methacrylates onto olefin copolymer rubbers, but not chlorinated polyethylene and the proportion of acrylates is far below that employed in the present invention. u. s. patent 3,981,958, nakashlma et al., sept. 21, 1976, discloses grafts (on spines other than chlorinated polyethylene) of methacrylic ester moleties, particularly lower alkyl methacrylates which have a higher glass transition temperature than materials employed in the present invention. u. s. patent 4,066,590, eldred et al., jan. 3, 1978, discloses olefin copolymer rubber compositins with in- proved heat and oil resistance made by vulcanizing in a mold a mixture of the rubber with 10-35 phr of one of the following: (a) trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate; (b) polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate; (c) ethylene glycol dimethacrylate; or (d) triallylcyanurate; plus 6 phr of halogenated organic compound, plus10-25 phr zinc oxide, plus
