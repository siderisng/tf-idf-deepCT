<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to certain dimercaptopyridazine thiones, and to their zinc complexes and alkali metal salts, which possess antifugal activity. according to the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula: emi1.1 wherein r is 2, c1-ca alkyl, -ch2ch2(c1-c4 alkoxy) cr benzyl; or a zinc complex thereof; or an alkali methal salt of a compound of the formula (1) or (ii) or zinc complex thereof; together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, sai= composition being in unit dosage form (as hereinafter defined). the invention also provides a method of treating an animal, including a human being, having a fungal infection, which comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of either a compound of the formula (i) or (ii), or zinc complex or alkali metal salt as defined above, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising said compound, complex, or salt together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. the pharmaceutical composition can be unit dosage form (as hereinafter defined) for internal administration, or in a form suitable for topical adminis- tration. the invention further provides a compound of the formula (i) od (ii), zinc complex or salt defined above, for use in treating an animal, including a human being, having a fungal infection. ; the compounds of the formulae (i) and (ii) in which r is e or ch3 are known, but no medical use has previously been described for them /see j.c.s. perkin i, 1038 (1977); chew. pharm. bull., 18(5), 970-981 (1970); tetrahedron tatters no. 9, pp 393-396, 1962; j. bet. chem., 3, p 541 (dec. 1966); and j. bet. chem., 3, p 79 (march 1966)?. the zinc complexes and the compounds in which r is other than h or cb3 are however novel compounds. thus a further aspect of the invention provides a compound of the formula (i) or (ii) in which r is c2-c4 alkyl, -ch2ch2(c1-c4 alkoxy) or benzyl, or an alkali metal salt thereof; or a zinc complex of a compound of the formula (i) or (ii) in which r is h, c1-c4 alkyl, -ch2ch2(c1-c4 alkoxy) or benzyl or an alkali metal salt of said complex. the invention also includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula (i) or (ii) in which r is c2-ca alkyl, -ch2ch2(c1-c4 alkoxy) or benzyl, or an alkali metal salt thereof; or a zinc complex of a compound of the formula (i) or (ii) in which r is 2, c1-c4 alkyl, -ch2ch2(c1-c4 alkoxy) or benzyl, cr an alkali metal salt of said complex; together with a pharmaceutically acceptablediluent or carrier the most active compounds are those in which r is h or ce3 and their alkali metal salts and zinc complexes. the compounds of the formulae (i) and (ii) can exist in tautomeric forms, and such tautomers and compositions containing them, etc./ are also within the scope of the invention. for example, when r is h, formulae (i) and (ii) tautomeric structures. by the term "unit dosage form" as used herein is meant a
