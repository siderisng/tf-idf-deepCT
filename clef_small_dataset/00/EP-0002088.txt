<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for computerized axial tomography  (cat) image reconstruction applicable to x-ray  scanning of the human body.  successive series of calculations  determine the values of a characteristic in defined  segmented areas of an examination plane.  a reduction in  the time and equipment requirements for reconstruction  calculations may thereby be effected.  images representative of the difference between the  value of the characteristic at a reconstruction point and the  average value of the characteristic in adjacent regions (δµ)  may be calculated and displayed from measurements  taken within a localized contiguous region of the examination  plane.  radiation dose to patients and computation  time in x-ray computerized axial tomography scanning  systems is thus reduced.  differential displays of the type  described may be adjusted to image boundaries, in which  case they do not suffer from gray scale resolution problems  which are typical of prior art displays.  image artifacts attributable to interpolation errors  may be reduced with negligable effect on resolution by  incorporating a weighting function, preferentially a  gaussian function, in the image reconstruction.
