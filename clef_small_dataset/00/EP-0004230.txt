<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling and controlling the inclination of the crate of a vehicle mounted on at least one rolling rate on which the crate is articulated around a substantially horizontal axis and placed in the median plane of this one. The device according to the invention comprises means for failover and holding the inclination of the body (1) controlled by a motor shaft (22) trained in rotation by the means for moving the vehicle and comprising a failover mechanism susceptible to to be trained in two directions opposite by said motor shaft (22) by means of one or the other of two disengable coupling means controlling the tilting each in one direction and a progressive clutch means of one or the one or more The other of said coupling means controlled directly by the pendulum mass (82, the spacement thereof from one side or the other of the plane passing through its oscillation axis and parallel to the median plane of the box (1) Commanding the progressive clutch of that of the two coupling means determining the failover of the crate in the direction to reduce the median plane therein into the direction of the apparent vertical passing through the oscillation axis and the hundred re of severity of the pendulum mass.
