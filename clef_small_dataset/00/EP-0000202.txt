<ABSTRACT>
The device for controlling the line strength change of photosat fonts, which are designed by means of a photosat system, contains at least one control field (3) which has at least two surface elements whose smallest width and their smallest distance corresponds to the line strength tolerance of a font. The smallest width unn the smallest distance of the two surface elements is the bar strength tolerance of a font equal plus the line width of the finest line, which can be reproduced by the photosat system in which this control device is used. The surface elements of the control device may have the shape of a band, a circular surface, a rectangle or a square. In a further embodiment of the present control device, a further control field (11) is associated with the already mentioned control field (3), which has at least two surface elements whose smallest width and their smallest distance are smaller or greater than the widths or the distances of the surfaces elements In the former control panel.
