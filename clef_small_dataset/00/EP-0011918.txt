<ABSTRACT>
photopolymerisable compositions capable of polymer­ isation by an acid-catalysed mechanism under the influence  of ultraviolet and/or visible light comprise (a) at least one  material capable of polymerisation by an acid-catalysed  mechanism to a polymeric material of higher molecular  weight state, (b) a photosensitive aromatic sulphonium salt  and (c) a material which under the conditions of photo­ polymerisation will yield a significant proportion of free radi­ cals.  these compositions yield useful coating films and other  products on irradiation.
