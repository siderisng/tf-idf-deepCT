<ABSTRACT>
an electronic control system for a television receiver (12)  incorporates a light pen (10) which can be applied to selected  portions (16) of the screen (14).  these portions (16) are mod足 ulated at the field scan rate by data inputs such that  in successive television fields they are black or white in accor足 dance with the values 1 or 0 of the bits of the data.  the data can  be used to pre-programme the receiver, or alternatively sim足 ply stored or printed.  the light pen can also be used to read  bar codes (36) in a broadcasting periodical (38), and to distin足 guish whether the light pen is reading the crt or a bar code a  differentiator (42) and asymmetry detector (44) sense whether  the light pen output pulses have sharp or decaying trailing  edges.  in an alternative arrangement the light pen can be used  with a light emitting diode such as on a radio receiver or a  telephone.
