<ABSTRACT>
a method of making 5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-n-phenyl-­ 1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxamide is based on the use of an  oxathiolane, namely, 2-methyl-n-phenyl-1,3-oxathilane-2-­ acetamide, which may be formed by condensing 2-mercap­ toethanol with acetoacetanilide under acidic conditions in  a solvent medium (aromatic hydrocarbon, chlorinated hy­ drocarbon or alkyl ester of an aliphatic acid).  the said  oxathilane, with or without purification, is reacted with  hydrogen peroxide in water or in a water-organic solvent  mixture under basic conditions in the presence of a catalytic  amount of a metal compound such as sodium tungstate to  form 2-methyl-n-phenyl-1,3-oxathiolane-2-acetamide 3-ox­ ide.  the said oxathiolane oxide, while dissolved in a chlori­ nated hydrocarbon or an alkyl ester of an aliphatic carb­ oxylic acid, or while suspended in an aromatic hydrocarbon,  is subjected to a ring expansion reaction by heating under  acidic conditions in the presence of a catalytic quantity of  an anium compound, i. e. , a quaternary ammonium salt or  sulfonium, sulfoxonium or phosphonium compound, to  form 5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-n-phenyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carb­ oxamide with evolution of water.  the product is a known  bactericide and fungicide.
