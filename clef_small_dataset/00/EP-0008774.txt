<ABSTRACT>
a silicon body (10) of a first conductivity type is covered  with a sandwich of silicon dioxide (12), polycrystalline silicon  (14) and silicon nitride (16).  source, drain, and interconnect  work sites of the body are exposed by a first photoshaping  operation.  the work sites are doped forming regions (21, 22,  23) of a second conductivity type.  silicon dioxide (24, 26, 28) is  grown over the work sites.  a second photoshaping operation  provides an opening 36.  the walls of the opening 36 on two  opposite sides comprise sides of the sandwich layer as estab­ lished by the first photoshaping operation and the two  remaining walls comprise sides of the silicon dioxide as estab­ lished by the second photoshaping operation.  silicon nitride  (44) is next deposited over the entire wafer (15) which is then  photoshaped to define the field regions (46, 48).  the etching  process is continued to remove part of the silicon body as well  as the sides of those exposed regions.  thereafter, silicon  dioxide (47, 49) is grown in the field regions.  the remaining  silicon nitride layer is removed to reveal the underlying con­ ductive polycrystalline silicon (14) at the gate region, the walls  of the contact opening 36 and the interconnect region 23.  a  conductive material (51,50) is deposited over the wafer (15)  and then photoshaped to provide the desired pattern of  interconnections.
