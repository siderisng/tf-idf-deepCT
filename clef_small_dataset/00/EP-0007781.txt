<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a method of controlling the cur­ rent supplied by acurrent source to a load.  the current is  supplied to the load 12 via a first conductor 11 from the current  source 10 and the current in the first conductor 11 is moni­ tored by a second conductor 13 disposed alongside the first so  that a current is induced in the second conductor 13 which is  proportional to the current in the first conductor 11.  the signal  in the second conductor 13 is fed back to control the supply of  current by the current source 10 in dependence upon the  behaviour of the induced signal.  the invention is applicable to the short circuit protection  of amplifier end stages and the control of loudspeaker ampli­ fiers in the resonance frequency region.

<DESCRIPTION>
controlling the current supplied to a load this invention relates to a method of controlling the current supplied by a current source to a load, and is applicable to the short circuit protection of amplifier end stages and the control of loudspeaker amplifiers in the resonance frequency region. conventional protective circuits for amplifier final stages are only practicable up to medium power outputs. for amplifier outputs of 200 watts, 500 watts and above, the conventional circuits are no longer sufficiently rapid in response, and they mostly possess the property that the final stages must be regulated down to a so-called 'safe value'. nevertheless in such cases substantial currents still flow and the resulting dissipated heat is very high. in the case of long persisting short circuit conditions, the final transistors are usually damaged (due to thermal instability) or else they oscillate in the hf region and thus disturb, for example, a connected loudspeaker system. in the limiting case, that is to say in the case of a short circuit of the medium ohmic class, the protection is not at all effective and adjustment of the electronic circuitry is very critical and in most cases must be separately effected for both halves of the final stage. in the case of final stages in push-pull circuit the electronic circuitry is already very expensive. thus it is an object of the invention to provide a method of controlling the current supplied by a current source to a load, the control being rapidly effective in response to a predetermined behaviour of the current. accordingly the invention provides a method of controlling the current supplied by a current source through a first conductor to a load, wherein the current in the first conductor is monitored by a second conductor disposed alongside the first so that a current is induced in the second conductor which is proportional to the current in the first conductor, and the supply of current by the current source is controlled in dependence upon the behaviour of the current induced in the second conductor. embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram illustrating the principles on which the invention is based, - and figures 2 to 4 are schematic diagrams of respective control circuits embodying the invention. the invention is based upon the fact that an electromagnetic field is formed around any conductor carrying an electric current. thus, if a second conductor is laid alongside the first, a current is induced in the second conductor which is proportional to the current in the first conductor. this principle is shown in figure 1. a current source 10, such as a generator or amplifier, supplies current through a main conductor 11 to a load 12 such as a resistor, motor or loudspeaker. an auxiliary conductor 13 is disposed alongside the main conductor 11 for a distance of, for example, ten centimetres. the current induced in

claims:   1. a method of controlling the current supplied by a current source through a first conductor to a load, wherein the current in the first conductor is monitored by a second conductor disposed alongside the first so that a current is induced in the second conductor which is proportional to the current in the first conductor, and the supply of current by the current source is controlled in dependence upon the behaviour of the current induced in the second conductor.    2. a method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the current source is an amplifier and the load is a loudspeaker.   3. a method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the control is effected in such manner that an input signal to the amplifier is disconnected when the induced current exceeds a preselected threshold.   4. a method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the control is effected in such manner that the power to the amplifier is disconnected when the induced current exceeds a preselected threshold.   5. a method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the control is effected in such manner that the characteristics of the amplifier are modified in the region of the resonance frequency of the loudspeaker.     6. a method substantially as described with reference to figure 2, 3 or 4 of the accompanying drawings.   7. an apparatus arranged to be operated according to the method of any preceding claim.
