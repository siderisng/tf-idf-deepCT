<ABSTRACT>
1.  insulation layer field effect transistor with a channel region (16) of a second conductivity type formed between source (4) and drain (6) of a first conductivity type, in a substrate (2) of the second conductivity type and an insulated gate electrode over the channel region, characterised in that a buried insulation layer (10) is provided in the substrate (2) under the channel region (16) between source (4) and drain (6) which extends into the substrate (2) the effective transistor depletion zone appearing in connection with the channel region (16), which layer (10) can be completely depleted by the application of a critical substrate-source bias vxsc , whereby the distance between the electrostatic charges on the gate electrode and the charges induced by them in the substrate (2) is increased to such an extent that the sensivity of the threshold voltage vt relative to the changes of the substrate-source bias vxs is reduced.
