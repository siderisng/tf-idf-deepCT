<ABSTRACT>
pilferproof closure and container assembled with such  closure.  a tamper-proof cap (35) and neck (12) assembly  made of stretchable plastics material in which the neck  (12) has portions (14, 21) fitted within and about a short  metal neck portion (3) of a container (5) which serves as  a rigidifying back up for the plastic neck and for a locking  shoulder (13) on the neck (12) to provide a deflection  resistant structure and thereby prevent a tamper-indicating  ring (52) connected to the cap (35) from slipping off the  shoulder (13) without tearing upon linitial unthreading of  the cap (35).  this rigidified structure also facilitates appliÂ­ cation of the tamper-indicating ring (52) during initial  threading of the cap (35) onto the threaded neck (12) at  which time the ring (52) is stretched over the shoulder  (13) by a capper bead which engages force-transmitting  posts (58) integral with the ring (52) for forcing the ring  over the locking shoulder, the band (52) being stretched  between the posts (58) and extending beneath the shoulder  (13) as chordal segments.
