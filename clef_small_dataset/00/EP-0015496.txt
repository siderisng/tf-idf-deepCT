<ABSTRACT>
amine molybdates are formed by reacting molyb­ denum trioxide (moo₃) with an amine in an aqueous  medium essentially free of acid and in which is dissolved a  water-soluble ammonium or monovalent metal or divalent  metal or trivalent rare earth metal salt of an acid, or a  combination thereof.  although the reaction may be carried  out at room temperature, the reaction mixture desirably is  heated to between about 75° c to 110° c and preferably is  refluxed to reduce the time required for completion of the  reaction.  the reaction slurry is stirred while the reaction is  occurring.  upon completion of the reaction, the amine  molybdate is separated from the liquid phase, and is washed  and dried.  after removal of the solid amine molybdate from  the slurry the liquid component can be reused avoiding  possible environmental difficulties.
