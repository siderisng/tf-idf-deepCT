<ABSTRACT>
this railway rail consists of a rail head (1), rail web (2) having a double form, and adjoining rail-foot flanges (3).  so that the rail head (1) of the rail, which has a high moment of resistance against vertical and horizontal flexure, can yield elastically when subjected to horizontal and vertical impacts, the rail head having an optimum wear mass, the double rail web (2) is close together in the upper region (4) which terminates approximately vertically in the rail head (1) protruding on both sides, and bent apart in the lower region (6) in an arcuate manner towards the rail-foot flanges (3) which are angled to the outside.
