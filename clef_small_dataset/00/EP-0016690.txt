<ABSTRACT>
the influent is first mixed in a mixing chamber (3) and  then transferred to a settling chamber (7) through hydrodyÂ­ namic changing means able to reduce momentum transfer  to the liquid in said settling chamber and thus increase the  rate of sedimentation of the suspended solids.  according to the invention, the hydrodynamic changing  means comprise a perforated plate (5) which defines spaced  flow paths (21) inclines with respect to the plate as well as  relatively to each other so that the tangential velocity  components of the flows of iiquid exiting same tend to  cancel one another.  for use particularly in waste treatment systems.
