<ABSTRACT>
an improved process to produce a novel tissue which  becomes ply-separable during the papermaking process.  in a  first embodiment of the invention a two-layered stratified  web is formed, having a first layer (113a) comprised of a  relatively high consistency slurry of long papermaking fibers  and a second layer (113b) comprised of a lower consistency  slurry of relatively short papermaking fibers.  in a second  embodiment of the invention, a stratified web having three  layers is formed, comprised of well-bonded layers separated  by an interior barrier layer.  these improved tissue products  need not be creped from a creping roll with a doctor blade in  order to exhibit ply-separability, and they may be creped in a  single step to form a finished product which is creped all the  way through.
