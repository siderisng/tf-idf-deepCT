<ABSTRACT>
foot frames for tables, benches or the like are generally rigidly connected to the table or bench plates or slats (2).  a possibility is to be provided, by means of which the foot frame of tables, benches or the like can be adapted to unevenness in the floor in a simple manner.  the foot parts (3), which are arranged spaced apart, are connected to one another via a horizontal profile piece (7), the profile piece (7) being fixedly connected to the one foot part (3) and being swivellable in relation to the other foot part (4).  an arm (9), which is attached to the profile piece (7) and projects at right angles from the latter, can be swivelled in relation to the other foot part (4) and can be arrested in relation to the latter in the respectively set position.  the foot parts are fixedly connected to the table or bench plates or slats (2) so that, when the foot parts (3 and 4) undergo an adjustment movement, the plates or slats (2) are curved in their longitudinal direction and consequently the position is always secured non-positively.  <image>
