<ABSTRACT>
a remover, such as for removing nail polish, lacquer, or  enamel, in which the remover preparation is provided for  application in the form of a foam which provides handiness,  convenience, and other advantages.  other forms are pre­ sented also.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
lacquer remover this invention relates to a removal preparation and application procedure, and it is particularly desirable as for removal of so-called nail polish or nail lacquer or nail enamel from a person's fingernails or toenails. concepts of the present invention provide, in a desirable embodiment, a lacquer-remover preparation which is packaged in a dispenser, with the remover substance dispensed therefrom and applied in the form of a foam. other forms of the remover preparation, with other types of containers and dispensing means, are also included. the concepts also provide an advantageous and desirable remover substance or mixture. many advantages are provided by the inventive concepts. particularly contrasting conventional or usual removal methods for removing nail polish or lacquer from fingernails, for example, the present invention overcomes or greatly reduces the messiness, bother, and other disadvantages of conventional liquid polish removers. that is, conventional nail polish remover liquid is somewhat messy to apply and use, usually being done with the aid of cotton swabs or tissues. if the liquid spills, either some drops or the whole bottle, it has a very bad and difficult-to-repair effect on the finish of many surfaces. its odor is often not pleasant. the polish tends to smear onto skin regions adjacent the nail. the physiological effect o conventional removal liquid is a harsh or caustic drying effect on the user's nails and skin, causing a disadvantageous removal of natural oils from the user's skin. conventional remover can be painful if the user has any hangnail or cut or scratch on the cuticle or other skin adjacent the nail itself. much of the remover liquid is wasted, by either spillage or evaporation. extra time and bother is often used, to avoid spillage and evaporation, by a succession of closure and opening procedures for the remover liquid container's cap. it is a fire hazard. the concepts of the present invention, quite in contrast, provide in a preferred embodiment a convenient ease of application and procedure, whereby a dispensing of a foamtype remover is easily done specifically onto the nail and only a small area adjacent the nail. it need be left on only several seconds, much less than a minute, and usually about only one-fourth of a minute. then a relatively simple wipe-off with a tissue is usually all that is required; and the nail is not only satisfactorily clean of the polish, but neither the nail nor the adjacent skin is apparently harmed in the least, and the nail has a nice odor and feel. further, there is only a minimal danger of any spilling onto a surface which would be damaged, and there is no unpleasant odor; and any fire hazard of the lacquer solvent is minimal, much less than with conventional removers. moreover, the succession of closing and opening of a bottlecap is avoided. further, the foam nature seems to provide a special advantage, in that as the foam bubbles break down on the user's nail, there is achieved a sort of an automaticallyachieved

<CLAIMS>
    claims      1. a remover preparation for removing nail polish, in which  the remover preparation is dispensed in a foam or foam  like nature, and in which the preparation remains stable  in its foam or foam-like condition throughout a time  delayed breakdown of 'the foam or foam-like condition to  a liquid, thereby allowing solvent penetration into the  nail polish over an extended period of time, to thereby  achieve its polish-solubility and effective polish  removal, with only a small amount of   liquification    of  the preparation during its time-delayed breakdown,  feeding in a successive manner small increments of the  solvent in the then-liquid form to bperatively contact  the nail polish.   2. the invention as set forth in claim 1, in which the  preparation contains a foaming agent or agents which  provide the aforesaid time-delay breakdown of the foam  or foam-like condition of the preparation while it is on  the user's nail.   3. the invention as set forth in either of claims 1 or 2,  in which the foaming agent or agents, which achieve the  dispensing to be in a foam or foam-like nature, is/are  selected from a group consisting of stearic acid, soaps  or
