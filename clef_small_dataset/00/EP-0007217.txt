<ABSTRACT>
a mounting device (21,22,23) for anchoring a machine  element (11) coaxially on a rotary shaft (12).  the device fits  between the machine element and the shaft and is effective to  position the element at any desired position longitudinally of  the shaft and at any angular position circumferentially of the  shaft.  the device has similarly tapered inner (21) and outer  (22) segmented sleeves, so that relative axial displacement of  the sleeves effects radial expansion and contraction of the  combined elements.  at one end (29) the inner sleeve cooper­ ates with a nut (23) to effect the axial displacement of the  sleeves.  the outer sleeve has separate segments (36) coupled  with said nut to permit limited pivotal movement of the seg­ ments.  in another embodiment, the sleeves (121,122)  are constructed to avoid relative rotation between the sleeves  by a locking portion (146).  in a third embodiment, the  inner sleeve (221) also has separable segments (226) and a  tubular element (260) which are interconnected similarly to  the interlocking of the outer sleeve segments with the nut.   improved performance is provided by providing  anti-friction bearing elements (350) between the nut (323) and  the outer sleeve (321) and anti-friction screw threads (338)  between the nut (323) and the inner sleeve (322).  alternatively  , an anti-friction coating (450) may be applied to the  nut (423).
