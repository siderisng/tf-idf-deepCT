<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for aerating liquids on water-basis containing organic components, especially dung-water or canalisation waster water, said device having a circulating wheel being driven through an electric motor anf being provided with displacement shells or ribs and having further an air suction tube being disposed coaxially to said circulating wheel and above the latter, the upper inlet of which suction tube extends over the liquid level, characterized in that the displacement shells or ribs (13, 14 or 15 respective) have different flowing resistances in both rotational directions and that the rotational direction of the motor (5) is to be changed from a more intensive circulation and aeration corresponding to a rotation of the displacement shells or ribs with the larger flowing resistance in connection with larger motor power to a les intensive circulation and aeration corresponding to a rotation of the displacement shells or ribs with the smaller flowing resistance in connection with smaller motor power.
