<ABSTRACT>
a bonding process for grinding tools in which a metallic  workpiece (10) is pre-etched (14) to form cavities in  the surface of the workpiece for individually receiving abrasive  particles to be bonded thereto.  the etched workpiece  is at least partially embedded in a layer (46) of the  abrasive particles in a first plating bath (20) comprising an  aqueous solution of metal ions (22) and an electromotive  force is imposed across the workpiece and an anode (34)  so that the abrasive particles become partially embedded  in the cavities in the workpiece surface as metal is plated  on to the surface and around the abrasive particles adjacent  to the surface.  a second plating of metal in a second  plating bath (40) securely bonds the particles to the workpiece  and can provide the workpiece with a predetermined  hardness for a particular application.  the dual bonding  process can be repeated for each layer to make multi-layered  tools.
