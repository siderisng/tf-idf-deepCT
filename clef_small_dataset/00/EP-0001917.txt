<ABSTRACT>
a closure mechanism, such as a shutter in a camera, in  which a closure member (11) having a arcuate portion (12) is  arranged to roll on a support member (19) to cause a part  (20) of the closure member to move across an aperture (4)  thereby providing a movable barrier permitting selective  communication of the aperture with spaces on opposite  sides of the closure member.  when used in a camera, the  closure member (11) is accommodated in an enclosure of  which one wall (10) includes the aperture, which may be a  fibre optic plate (4).  the closure member is movable between  two extreme positions; in one position a mirror (15) carried  by the closure member optically couples the aperture with a  viewing system (16, 17) and in the other position it blocks the  viewing system while a film (5) is located adjacent the aperture  by a mechanism (21, 22) actuated in synchronism with  the closure member.
