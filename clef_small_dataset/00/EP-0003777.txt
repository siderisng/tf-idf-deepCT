<ABSTRACT>
a procedure and a device for reactivating the adhesive melting layer (13) of dowels (11) are specified.  for this purpose, a power- driven driving-in apparatus (1) is provided with a magazine (9) for receiving the dowels (11) joined to a strip (10), and at its front end with a nozzle (16), the nozzle bore (17) of which is smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the coated dowel (11).  before being driven into the bore (26) of the workpiece (25), the dowel (11) is driven through the nozzle bore (17), in which process the adhesive melting layer (13) is compressed and reactivated.  the melt adhesive solidifies in the bore (26) of the workpiece (25), as a result of which the dowel (11) is firmly joined to the workpiece (25).  <image>
