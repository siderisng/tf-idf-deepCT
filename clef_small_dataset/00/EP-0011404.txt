<ABSTRACT>
a process for producing methanol and ammonia by  generating nitrogen-containing synthesis gas, reacting the  carbon oxides and hydrogen incompletely to methanol and  passing the unreacted gas to ammonia synthesis, is characterised  by carrying out the methanol synthesis in a first, steamfree,  stage and in a second stage in the presence of sufficient  steam to convert to carbon dioxide substantially all the carbon  monoxide not converted to methanol.  methanol can be taken  from the synthesis stage as part of the product or can be  recycled to that stage, thus limiting its methanol output.  in a preferred example synthesis gas is generated by  primary steam reforming (12) and air secondary reforming  (20) of a hydrocarbon feedstock, dehumidified (30), compressed  (32) and reacted over catalyst (44) to produce methanol.   the gas is separated at (54) into liquid methanol and  unreacted gas, which is humidified at (62) and reacted over a  second methanol synthesis catalyst (68).  the gas from this  catalyst is cooled to condense aqueous methanol, washed  (76) with cold water to remove residual methanol and passed  to coâ‚‚-removal (80), methanation (86) and ammonial synthesis  in reactors (114) and (118).  condensate from the second  methanol synthesis stage is in part recycled via humidifier  (62), in part sent to distillative purification along with the  product of the first methanol synthesis stage (44).
