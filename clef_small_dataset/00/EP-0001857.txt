<ABSTRACT>
plant for the continuous production of high-value producer and water gas which is substantially free of ballast nitrogen from solid and high-boiling liquid fuels, comprising an indirectly heated reaction space subdivided into a plurality of chambers (27, 29, 31, 33) and, connected thereto, a heating space which supplies the thermal energy and also a number of heat exchange units accommodated in the heating space and in the flue gas channel (17), such as steam kettle (41), steam superheater (38, 44, 45), tar vaporiser (51), air preheater (14) for the combustion air and heat exchangers (57, 61) for the heat transport between the heating space and the reaction space by means of  circulating gas.  the plant further includes a water container (39) and a tar container (47) and also a number of pumps and blowers (11, 19, 37, 40, 54, 59).  by reinforcing the ceramic reaction space it is possible to lay out the plant for pressurised gas production.  <image>
