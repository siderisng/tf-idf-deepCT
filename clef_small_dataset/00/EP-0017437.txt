<ABSTRACT>
a gas sampling device (50) includes a sampling channel  (52) incorporating a coanda-effect device (90) which is  arranged to produce a flow of the gas to be tested through  the sampling channel (52).  a venturi (69) is provided in the  channel upstream of the coanda-effect device (90) so as to  produce a pressure differential between two locations in the  channel in response to gas flow therethrough.  a testing  channel inlet connection (73) communicates by way of an  annular filter element (80) with the location which is at the  higher pressure and provides a filtered flow path to a  gas-testing device.  a testing channel outlet connection (74)  communicates with the other, lower pressure location to  provide a gas return path from the gas testing device.  an improved construction of coanda-effect device is  also disclosed, as is a gas monitoring system incorporating  the gas sampling device in combination with a gas duct, such  as a flue arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved gas flow and gas sampling devices background of the invention ( fild of the invention this invention relates to improved gas flow devices using the coanda effect and also to improved gas sampling devices that may advantageously be used for extracting for test purposes a contiruous sample of a gas which may contain suspended particulate matter (2) description of the prior art in a number of applications1 such as flue gas analysis, there is a requirement to sense continuously the condition of a flowing gas. in one continuous sampling device, described in u.s. patent no. re 29,2091 a continuous flow of gas through a testing apparatus is produced by producing in the apparatus a temperature differential whereby gas is withdrawn from and returned to the main stream by convection. the rate of gas flow thus produced is necessarily slow and the flow must not be obstructed. widen this apparatus is used to sample gases contaminated by suspended particles the low flow rate results in deposition of the particles in the test apparatus leading to large and spurious variations in the measured characteristic and frequent cleaning is therefore required another problen with such an arrangement is that, due to the relatively slow rate of gas flow, testing performed ni tne sampled gas will have a correspondingly long response time. furthermore ince t gas flo depends on convection, the sampling device must be mounted so as to provide a vertical flow pat):.; this only one orientation of the apparatus is possible, which is a major di sadvantage in use. the use of the coaiida effect, first patented by h. coanda in u.s. patent no. 2,052,869, to effect isokinetic gas flow sampling for the purpose of obtaining a gas sample to be continuously tested has heretofore been proposed in, for example, u.s. patent no. 4,060,00l. the arrangement disclosed therein utilizes a coanda-effect device to provided flow of a gas to bc sampled, the outlet of the device being arranged to induce flow of the gas into a sample probe for analysis. one disadvantage with this arrangement is that the motive gas supply, frequently air under pressure, is introduced into the gas flow to be sampled. the results of the analysis by the probe are accordingly inaccurate as the gas has been diluted by the motive gas supply. when the motive gas is air, and the gas being monitored is oxygen or nitrogen, this inaccuracy can be substantial. a further disadanage of this arrangement is that when a contaminated gas is being monitored, despite the high flow velocities involved, particles suspended in the gas may still be deposited on the sample probe as described above with reference to the convection sampling arrangement. in another known testing apparatus, a continuous sample of gas is withdrawn from the main gas stream by passing the main stream through a passage having a restriction and coupling a conduit containing the testing apparatus between one location in the passage upstream of the restriction und another location in the
