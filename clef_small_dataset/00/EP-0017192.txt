<ABSTRACT>
In order to deposit oil from an oil-water mixture and to reduce the spinning degrees in the recovered water so that an environmental impact is not carried out, the mixture is preferably over a plurality of angle to each other with an oil-repellent fleece (30)provided in a housing (12) arranged oblique levels (18, 20, 22, 24) passed.In this case, the water penetrates through the fleece and is supplied at the lowest point of each plane of a collecting device (34, 36, 38, 40, 42), whereas the oil above the nonwoven is collected at the lowest point of the lowest level (24).
