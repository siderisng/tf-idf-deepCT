<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a device suitable for use as a toy  or educational aid.  it basically comprises a housing (4)  covering two or more discs (6,7) bearing markings such as  letters, numbers or other information.  viewing apertures (8)  enabling a part or parts of each disc (6,7) to be seen are  provided in the housing (4).  the discs (6,7) are rotated at  varying speeds and a reading is taken of the markings which  appear in the viewing apertures (8) when the rotation ceases.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to apparatus for the random selection of information. the invention has as itsobdect the provision of apparatus which can be operated to randomly select information for presentation to the operator, the randomly presented information being used, for example, as the basis of a game or for educational purposes. in accordance with the present invention, therefore, there is provided apparatus for random selection of information, the apparatus comprising a housing provided on one side thereof with at least one viewing aperture, or information indicator, at least two relatively rotatable co-axial discs arranged in the housing and each provided with a plurality of markings, which extend on a circular track concentric with the disc axis and which are arranged to be successively visible in conjunction with the information indicator, or through the viewing aperture or at least one of the viewing apertures on rotation of the respective disc, and a rotatable drive shaft projecting into the housing,+ one of the discs being rigidly coupled to the drive shaft to form a rotational assembly therewith and the other disc or at least one of the other discs being so mounted on the assembly as to be frictionally rotatable by but relative to the assembly. preferably both or all of the discs are readily demountable from and remountable on the drive shaft so that one or more of the discs may be replaced by substitute discs as desired. the housing is preferably constructed as a closed unit and may consist of, for example, a shallow box in which said one side is of circular or rectangular configuration. the housing may be made of cardboard, plastic, wood, metal or any other suitable material, preferably an economical and lightweight material or combination of materials such as cardboard or cardboard and plastic. in a preferred embodiment, said one side of the housn consists of stiff cardboard, with its outer face provided with markings and/or instructional information appropriate to the purpose and playing of the game or games for which the apparatus can be used. in certain constructions of the apparatus according to the invention, it may be possible for a substantial portion and a number of markings of one or more discs to be visible either in each viewing aperture or beyond the edges of the housing. in such circumstances an information indicator such as an arrow indicates the marking or markings to be chosen. the or each viewing aperture ma-y be of such a size as to permit simultaneous reading of all of theÂ¯tracks, or alternatively there may be a plurality of viewing apertures for individual reading of the tracks. it is, of course, possible to provide combinations of the different types of viewing aperture. the apertures may be provided by openings of rectangular, circular or any other suitable shape in the said one side of the housing and such openings may, if desired, be covered by a transparent material. the exact number, shape and disposition of the viewing apertures will, in
