<ABSTRACT>
in the bottom blown process for the refining of molten  steel, additional heat is generated for melting greater  amounts of scrap, by injecting at least one secondary stream  of an oxygen-containing gas to the space above the molten  metal bath so as to combust the co and h₂ evolving there­ from.  the excess heat so generated is absorbed both by the  bath and the furnace lining, causing overheating and rapid  deterioration of the lining.  for a given quantum of heat so  generated the ability of the molten metal to absorb a greater  portion of that heat and thereby maintain the temperature  of the furnace lining within the practical limits has been  found to depend to a significant extent on the design of  the furnace itself.  the invention is directed to conducting  the refining process in vessels which provide, for a given  bath capacity, greater top surface areas than has hereto­ fore been employed.
