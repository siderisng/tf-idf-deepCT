<ABSTRACT>
a method of continuously manufacturing a welding  electrode comprises coating a metal core member 1 with a  filler material in the form of a layer of coherent paste 4 under  substantial pressure, passing the coated core through a  drying kiln 7 and then bringing an outer metal strip 11 into  contact with the coated core member and deforming it  around the coated core to form a tubular sheath, and finally  closing the joint in the sheath by a continuous welding  operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
" weld ing electrode " - this invention relates to the manufacture of welding electrodes of the kind which comprise a metal core member, an outer tubular sheath, and a filler material between the core and the sheath. electrodes of this kind are particularly suitable for use in automatic welding. in known technology the said sheath is formed of a bent strip pressed or welded together at the seam. the sheath contains a filler material in the form of a powder whose nature depends on the type, dimensions and intended use of the electrode. provision of such a filler material improves the weld quality, diminishes heat losses in the welding zone, avoids atmospheric contamination, improves the electric arc stability and the metal yield, and reduces splashes. it may contain alloying metal particles. in one known process the filler is introduced into the tubular sheath after closing and winding up the tube on a reel, by feeding the powder through a screw driven hopper into the upper end of the tube. vibration is applied to urge the powder to progress through the whole tube length. a metal core member is not provided. in another known process, the filler powder is fed into a trough 'formed before the tube is- closed to form the sheath, and a metal strip is placed on the powder and located under the joint that is subsequently welded. a metal core in the form of a crimped wire may be centrally introduced into such a trough together with the powder, to provide a higher metallic yield at a reduced electric current supply. all these known methods use powder as a filler material and allow more or less continuous manufacture. however, the handling of powder is very difficult because it disperses easily in air currents and adheres to metals in undesired places. furthermore it is difficult to avoid segregation of the powder components, and some particles create pores in the weld seam when closing the tubular sheath. handling powders involves the riks of segregation of light from heavy particles and needs a supplementary agglomerating operation. extruded external powder layers on electrode rods are only practicable in short lengths, in order to permit the supply of electric current to the metal core. these powder layers are moreover easily contaminated, for example, by atmospheric moisture. it is already known to cover a core with a paste, but this is obtained by dipping the core in a paste at nearly atmospheric pressure. no substantial reduction in cross-section is envisaged afterwards. it is an object of the invention to provide an improved method of continuously manufacturing a welding electrode, which does not suffer from the aforementioned drawbacks. this is achieved according to the present invention by providing a method of continously manufacturing a welding electrode of the kind described comprising coating the metal member with a filler material in the form of a coherent paste in a continuous extrusion operation under substantial pressure, drying the extruded paste in a drying kiln after
