<ABSTRACT>
1.  the use of fire-resistant, dimensionally accurate lightweight building elements, optionally crushed and optionally in a classified state, as an absorption or adsorption agent for liquids, vapours and gases, having a gross density of about 160 kg/m**3 to 800 kg/m**3, the elements being based on fibre-reinforced calcium silicate compositions which have been obtained by a reaction of amorphous and crystalline silica or materials containing it, with calcium oxide or materials containing it, in a molar ratio of cao to sio2  of 0. 8 : 1 to 1. 1 : 1 with the addition of toxicologically harmless fibrous materials in the presence of water, and by shaping and hardening in an autoclave while dewatering, with the further measure that as an additional additive a synthetically produced calcium silicate granulate or powder having a molar ratio of cao to sio2  of 0. 8 : 1 to 1. 1 : 1 is used, and for the slow development of a gel structure the reaction is carried out before the shaping (pre-reaction) without the application of external heat.
