<ABSTRACT>
a cell connector for insuring direct electrical communication  and positive mechanical connection with a cell in a  bipolar permselective membrane electrolyzer, and which  precludes fluid or gaseous flow therefrom, is comprised of  an electrically non-conductive cell web (32), an electrically  conductive insert (36) disposed in an aperture in the web, an  electrode boss bearing a cell electrode on one face and  disposed adjacent the insert at a second face defining an  electrode interface, an electrically conductive fastener (44)  disposed through a bore in the insert and received in mating  engagement with the electrode boss for providing an axial  compressive force at the electrode interface, and a biasing  member (60) in operative engagement with the fastener for  providing a force in opposition to the axial compressive  force.
