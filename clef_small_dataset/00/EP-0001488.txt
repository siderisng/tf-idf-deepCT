<ABSTRACT>
dyeing and/or printing process which employs as an  additive a composition comprising one or more cations  selected from ammonium, group i and group ii metals of  the periodic tables due to mendeleef, one or more carboxylate  anions and water, the ratio of the anion to the  cation being in the range of 2:1 and 4:1 on a chemical  equivalent basis.  the additive can be incorporated into  the dyeing and/or printing process at various points in the  process, for example at the stages of scouring of the fabric,  mordanting, levelling, exhaustion, fixing finishing, waterproofing  and milling.  they are less corrosive to skin, clothing,  plastics and metal and hence are safer to the operative  and do not promote deterioration of equipment.
