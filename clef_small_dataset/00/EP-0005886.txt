<ABSTRACT>
a long bunker slightly inclined to the horizontal, having on its under surface one or more outlets which can be shut, and contacted by a vibrator mechanism which sets it in motion, forms the storage container of a device for dosing and mixing powdered materials.  the powders are esp.  pigments mixed with cement and stone.  an adjustable weighing arrangement is placed beneath the outlet of the bunker and includes a collector for the powders.  both the bunker and the collector are made of, or are lined with, a hard synthetic material which has little or no adhesion for the pigment.  for the production of coloured cement and imitation stone objects, such as roof tiles, the colours of which are reproducible.  no separate mixers are required and blended colours are mixed in the same device.  the dosing is accurate to within 5 g in several dozen kilos.
