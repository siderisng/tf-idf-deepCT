<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for reheating stack gases leaving a plurality  of scrubbers (34, 36) which uses water within an associated  steam generator (12) as the heating source.  a heat exchanger  (46) receives heat from the boiler water transferring it to a low  pressure fluid which is circulated through heat exchange surÂ­ faces (38,40) downstream of each of the scrubbers (34,36).   the flow of the high pressure boiler water is controlled in  response to a temperature (176) of the low pressure fluid  thereby providing a means for minimizing the flow and return  temperature of the high pressure water.  the high pressure  water is taken from a circulating pump discharge (24) and  returned to the circulating pump suction (12).
