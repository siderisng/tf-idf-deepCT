<ABSTRACT>
organic material is heated in a pyrolytic reactor 15 in  which an initial charge of charcoal is located, thereby driving  off volatiles from the organic material while leaving charcoal  (char) behind.  the volatiles are then passed over a base mat­ erial which is at a temperature substantially above the pyroliz­ ing temperature which causes a chemical reaction of the tars  and volatiles, resulting in an output of a gaseous mixture  consisting largely of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, charac­ terized by an absence of tars.  the reactor 15 is arranged to  permit a continuous flow of organic material volatiles, and  char through it, resulting in continual replenishment of  organic material in its pyrolizing portion, and replenishment  of the charcoal bed portion by the char produced from the  pyrolysis reaction.
