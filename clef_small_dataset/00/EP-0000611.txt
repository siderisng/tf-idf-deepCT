<ABSTRACT>
a piston compressor preferably for producing compressed  air at high pressure for the filling of divers' breathing air  cylinders, comprising a cylinder and a plunger type piston  provided with sealing rings at both ends thereof, these  respective piston ends operating in cylinder bore portions of  unequal diameters, the cylinder having stationary sealing  rings located between these two bore portions for sealingly  engaging the piston wall and thus divide the ring cylindrical  space between the sealing rings of the opposed piston ends  into two individual compression chambers usable as consecutive  compression stages.  a first compressing stage of  large volume can be provided between the piston top and  the cylinder end, and the compressor may thus operate as a  three stage compressor with the use of a simple and robust  cylinder and piston arrangement.
