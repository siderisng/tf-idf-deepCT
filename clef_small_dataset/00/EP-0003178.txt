<ABSTRACT>
a presence sensing system comprises a transmitter (13,  14) for transmitting a scanning signal to an area to be kept  under surveillance and an active receiver/transmitter device  (20, 21, 22, 23, 24) the presence of which is to be detected in  the surveillance area.  the receiver (21) of the receiver/Â­ transmitter device being adapted to receive the scanning  signal upon entry into the surveillance area and the transmitter  (23) of the receiver/transmitter device being arranged to  transmit a presence signal in response to receipt of the  scanning signal.  a receiver circuit (17, 18) is provided for  receiving the presence signal to indicate the presence of the  receiver/transmitter device in the surveillance area.  the active receiver/transmitter device have a securing  arrangement for retaining the device on an article to be kept  under surveillance.  the presence sensing system includes a detector for a  security system having a generator (10, 11, 12, 15) for  generating a signal for transmission and a transmitter (13,  14) for transmitting the transmission signal for receipt by a  presence indicating security device.  the detector also comprises  a receiver (17, 18) for receiving a signal from the  security device in response to the transmission frequency  and a comparator (16) for comparing the received signal with  a generated frequency for providing a verified presence  indicating signal when there is predetermined relationship  therebetween.
