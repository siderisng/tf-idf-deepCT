<ABSTRACT>
a connection for rod-like components, such as fluid flow  path-defining components in a fluid powered free-piston  down-the-hole hammer drill, comprising inner and outer  components (7,5) having adjacent overlapping surfaces is  characterised by at least one circumferential recess (9,11) in  each of the overlapping surfaces, the recesses (9,11) being  opposed to define one ore more annular spaces each  accomodating an elastomeric sealing/retaining ring (8).  the  overlapping surfaces are preferably a close fit one within the  other and have a plurality of said recesses (9,11) spaced-apart  to accommodate correspondingly spaced rings (8) to distri­ bute stresses between the components (7,5) and to maintain  alignment thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
"connection of rod-like components" this invention concerns the connection of rod-like components to one another or to other components. the invention is especially concerned with establishing such connections in systems subject to high stress and/or vibration levels. the invention is especially concerned with the establishment of reliable fluid-tight connections between components, e.g. components defining fluid floe paths, within fluid-powered devices such as pneumatic tools, e.g. hammer drills, and the invention will be described in relation to such applications. in a hammer drill such as a down- the -hole rock drill unit, a piston is caused to reciprocate within a cylinder and to deliver blows to an anvil surface on a bit shank. the reciprocation of the piston is accomplished by alternately admitting pressure fluid such as compressed air to working chambers at opposite ends of the cylinder, this admission of pressure fluid to the working chambers, and the exhaust of fluid from these chambers, being controlled at least partly by the motion of the piston within the cylinder and relative to ports formed ii tiie cylinder wall and/or in the piston or in a tube extending therein or there through. there may be further control of the fluid flows by a valve system or the arrangement may be rralveless and rely entirely on tlle motion of the piston relative to other components to accompli±ll the necessary control of fluid flows into and out of the working chambers. in many such hammer drills and similar fluid-yowec7¯cd free-piston devices, certain of the fluid flow: paths involve tubes that extend within the device and that are connected to or closely associated with components subject to high levels of stress and/or vibration. for instance, the piston may carry a tube that extends from one or other end thereof so as to reciprocate with the piston and enter passages in a related component to accomplish a fluid control function during parts of the travel of the piston within the cylinder. in other cases the piston reciprocates relatively to a central tube that is fixed at one or other of its ends and has ports that communicate with the working chambers in accordance with the position of the piston relatively to the tube. in yet other cases a tube is fixed within one or other of the working chambers to enter a passage in the piston for part of the cycle of motion of the latter: a typical instance of this latter arrangement is the so-called foot valve that comprises a tube fixed to a central exhaust passage in the bit shank of a hammer drill and that co-operates with the piston to control the exhaust of pressure fluid from the working chambers. it is a common experience in the operation of hammer drills and like devices that such fluid-conveying tubes as above discussed are prone to failure at their connections to the components to which they are fixed. it is therefore common to adopt connection arrangements that involve the interposition of resilient material to damp

claims   1. a connection of rod-like components comprising inner and outer components having adjacent overlapping surfaces, characterised in that each of said overlapping surfaces is formed with at least one circumferential recess, the recesses in the respective components being opposed and together defining an annular space within which an elastomeric sealing/retaining ring is accommodated.   2. a connection according to claim 1, further characterised in that each component is formed with a plurality of said recesses providing a plurality of spacedapart annular spaces each accommodating an elastomeric   sealing/retaining    ring.   3. a connection according to claim 1 or 2, further characterised in that said overlapping surfaces are a close fit one within the other and   saidrecesses    are of greater depth in one such surface than the other.   4. a connection according to claim 1, 2 or 3, further characterised in that the or each said sealing/retaining ring is an o-ring.   5. a connection according to any preceding claim, further characterised in that the or each said sealing/retaining ring is a free element fixed to neither of said components.   6. a connection according to any preceding claim, further characterised in that the components are formed of different materials.     7. a connection according to any preceding   claini,    further characterised in that the inner component has a tapered lead-in to its surface formed with the or each said recess.   8. a connection according to claim 7, further characterised in that the inner component is a tube having a recessed surface formed at one end thereof behind said tapered lead-in, the wall thickness of the tube in the region of said end being selected to distort on assembly of the connection, the connection further comprising a plug that is introduced into said tube end, after assembly thereof in said outer component, to restore the tube end to a configuration matching the outer component recessed surface.    9. a fluid-powered free-piston down-the-hole hammer drill comprising flow path-defining components including inner and outer components having adjacent overlapping surfaces, characterised in that each said overlapping surface is formed with at least one circumferential recess, the recesses in the respective components being opposed and together defining an annular space within which an elastomeric   sealing/retaining    ring is accommodated.   10. a hammer drill according to claim 9, further characterised in that said inner and outer components comprise a connection in accordance with any one of claims 2 to 9.
