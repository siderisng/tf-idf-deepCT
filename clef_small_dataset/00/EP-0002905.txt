<ABSTRACT>
a rail fastening device for flat bottom rails laid on a  concrete slab-type track comprises a pair of identical gauge  adjustment collars (4, 5) each having an aperture (6) such  as to pass over a respective one of a pair of mounting  blocks (1, 2) embedded in or secured to the track on either  side of a rail (3) the aperture (6) being eccentric to provide  at least two walls (e. g.  a, d) of different thickness for  lateral adjustment of the position of the rail (3) with respect  to the mounting blocks (1, 2).  a further pair of collars  (12, 13) each with a concentric aperture (14) are in one  embodiment of the invention located over the respective  lateral adjustment collars (4, 5).  a securing device (15)  such as a spring clip is located between each mounting  block (4, 5) and the respective height adjustment collar  (12, 13) to exert clamping pressure on the rail.
