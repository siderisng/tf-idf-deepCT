<ABSTRACT>
An improvement of the torque transmission from the wheels of the travel rail (4) on the rails (7) can be reached by raising a rubber ring on the wheels.Since no power transmission is possible via the wheels, the contacting is via contact pins (2) arranged on the travel rail (4).Due to the rigid connection of the contact pins (2) with the game railroad (4) they move in case of track curvatures, track branches and points in a small extent from the roadway track.In order to allow a track-proof contacting, the ends of the two contact pins (2) engage in a groove guide (6) of a sliding bridge (3) sliding on both trips (7), which on the track by two each on the inside of the twoDriving rails (7) applied spacer pins (8) is guided and an electrical connection between the driving track NEN (7) and the contact pins (2).
