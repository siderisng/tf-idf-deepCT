<ABSTRACT>
articles are blow moulded from thermoplastic polymeric  materials containing high proportions of fillers such as glass  fibres.  the method comprises extruding the filled polymeric  material through a die (1) having a mandrel (3) for constraining  the material into a tubular shape, co-extruding between  the die (1) and the outer surface (10) of the material, a liquid  (9) having a freezing temperature lower than that of the material,  cooling the liquid (9) and the outer surface (10) of the  material during their passage through the die (1) to a temperature  below the freezing temperature of the material but  above the freezing temperature of the liquid (9) while maintaining  the inner surface (12) of the material molten; squeezing  the extrudate at suitable intervals to fuse the molten  inner surface together and thereby seal discrete lengths; and  inflating the sealed lengths to conform to a surrounding  mould to produce a shaped article.  lamina shapes may be  foam-filled to give stiff panels such as car body panels.
