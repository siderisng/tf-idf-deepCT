<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a process and apparatus for the  continuous countercurrent contact of a liquid phase with a  gaseous phase.  the process comprises directing the liquid  phase to make it fall continuously through a generally hori­ zontal circular orifice generally countercurrently to the gase­ ous phase made to rise continuously through that orifice,  while spinning both phases around a generally vertical axis,  extending through the center of that orifice, fast enough to  form the falling liquid phase intoa generally continuous annu­ lar liquid curtain spinning outward and downward from the  lower edge of the orifice, and directing the spinning gaseous  phase to make it pass through the generally continuous liquid  curtain before it can enter the bottom of the orifice.
