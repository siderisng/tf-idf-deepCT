<ABSTRACT>
illumination apparatus is provided for illuminating an  object (p) with light rays (a, b and c) from an elongated light  source (9).  the object (p) is supported in spaced relationship  with the light source (9) to receive the light rays.  means are  included for collimating some of the light rays (a and b)  originating from the source (9) and directing these collimated  rays along a predetermined path.  reflecting means (12 and  13) are positioned in the predetermined path for reflecting the  collimated light rays (a and b) to the object (p) to illuminate  the object.  more particularly, a pair of parabolic reflecting surfaces  (10 and 11) are positioned parallel to and adjacent the light  source (9).  each parabolic reflector collimates and reflects  some light rays from the source along respective predeter­ mined paths on opposite sides of a planar object.  a pair of  planar reflecting surfaces (12 and 13) are positioned in the  respective paths to receive light reflected from the parabolic  reflectors (10 respectively 11) and to reflect the light rays upon  the object (p) from opposite sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
illumination apparatus this invention relates to an illumination apparatus, particularly for a photographic printer, having an elongated light source for generating light rays to illuminate a document, which is supported in spaced relationship with the light source. apparatus for illuminating an original generally falls into two categories, each adapted to achieve the same result by a different engineering approach. one approach involves illuminating a slit through which the original is line-imaged by an optical system upon a photosensitive surface. either the original moves past the illuminated slit or the slit moves over a stationary original to achieve the same result. in both cases the image is built up line by line on the photosensitive surface. the other approach involves illuminating an entire copy plane in which the original is positioned. the latter approach requires at least a momentary phase in the copy cycle when all parts of the original may be simultaneously imaged on the photosensitive surface, i.e., the image of the document is at least momentarily stationary with respect to the photosensitive surface. for example, a short exposure of the original effectively "freezes" motion with respect to a moving photosensitive belt. exemplary of the first approach is united states patent no. 3,982,116 which describes a single light source and an arrangement of mirrors for reflecting light through a slit defined transversely to a copy platen. the mirrors surrounding the light source are designed to converge light rays to a line focus beyond the slit. by placing an original on the platen, and moving the platen relative to the slit, the converging light rays scan the surface of the original. the second approach is illustrated by copy machines described in each of united states patent nos. 3,586,849. in each machine, an original is plaza upon a transparent support platen mounted relative te an illumination lamp assembly. in order to provide hocgn- ious illumination, four lamps are orthogonally spaced around each edge of the original. 5 means of reflectors with compound surfaces (i.e., both planar and curved surfaces), light rays emitted from each lamp are reflected upon the surface of the original such that they ove--lap and complement rays from the opposing lamp. the light rays reflect upon the surface of the original and produce image light corresponding to the informational areas on the original. the image light traverses an optical system and exposes the photosensitive surface of a flexible photoconductive belt arranged on a belt assembly. the problem solved by this invention is to provide an illumination apparatus for efficiently using light emitted from a single light source to uniformly illuminate an original and which illumination apparatus consists of only a small number of compounds. this problem is solved in that the light source is disposed within a reflector for forming separated light beams, each with collimated light rays, and deflectors between the light source and the object, each of them corresponding to one of the light beams, which deflect the light beams onto the object to illuminate the entire
