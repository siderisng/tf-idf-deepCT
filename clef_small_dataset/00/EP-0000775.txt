<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a surface formation improved in the water vapor absorption capability and permeability surface formation made of natural or synthetic rubber or a rubber-like polymer. These fabrics, which are present, for example, as self-supporting films or coatings on documents, contain a uniformly incorporated addition of particles of at least one queleic, modified polymer. These swellable, modified polymers are in particular about minimum of about 50 wt. -% water-insoluble; They prefer to include swellable, modified carbohydrate derivatives, as with the aid of heat energy, radiation or by an additional chemical compound networked starch or cellulose ether. In a method for producing such fabrics, a rubber-containing base is added to a rubber-containing base of the particles of at least one swellable, modified polymer and evenly distributed therein, and the mixture is then, optionally under foaming, elapsed, or otherwise deformed and solidified. The fabrics according to the invention are particularly suitable for such applications, in which body fluids, such as physiological conditions. b. Sweat, occur. These include carriage-style rubberized textiles, shoe upper materials, shoe insoles, carpet back materials or hygiene items.
