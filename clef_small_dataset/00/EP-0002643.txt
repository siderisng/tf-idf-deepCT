<ABSTRACT>
1.  panel consisting of heat-weldable plastics material, which is able to serve in particular as a shutter or door member, comprising a frame constituted by rectilinear members (1) providing a recess, filled at least partly by sections (2) which are also rectilinear and extend between two opposed parallel members (1) of the frame, the means for joining two opposed members (1) of the frame and the sections (2) being constituted by a first rectilinear tongue (4) rigidly connected to each member (1), projecting from the inner edge (3) of the latter and engaging in grooves (7) provided in the end faces of the sections (2) transversely with respect to the latter, characterized in that said means for joining two members (1) of the frame and the sections (2) also comprise at least one second tongue (4') similar to the first cooperating with at least one second groove (7') in the same manner as the tongue (4) cooperates with the groove (7) and that the tongues (4, 4') are rigidly connected to each of the corresponding grooves (7, 7') by welding of the material in order to ensure the joining of the sections (2) to the members (1).
