<ABSTRACT>
a tablet dispensing device (15) comprises a substantially  flat support (16) having a single tablet dispensing aperture  therein.  a tray (19) is adapted to rotate on one surface of the  support (16) and has a plurality of openings therein disposed  in a circular orientation.  the openings are arranged to  individually align in registration with the aperture upon  rotation of the tray (19).  the tray (19) is adapted to receive a  tablet dispensing package (20) containing a plurality of  tablets (60).  a tablet (60) is dispensed by pressing it from the  package (20) through its corresponding opening in the tray  (19) and then through the aperture in the support (16) for  collection by the operator thereof.  rotation of the tray (19)  sequentially places each opening over the aperture in  alignment therewith so that the remaining tablets (60) can be  individually dispensed.
