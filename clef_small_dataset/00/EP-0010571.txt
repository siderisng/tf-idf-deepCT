<ABSTRACT>
to carry out (bio)chemical reactions and unit operations in homogeneous and heterogeneous fluid systems, the fluid systems are guided in such a way that during the reaction they are subject to various flow characteristics.  first the fluid systems are guided in a loop (8) whose pipe characteristic is adjustable between an idealised stirred tank characteristic and a real pipe characteristic.  on leaving the loop the fluid systems are guided through a spatially and temporally up- and/or downstream pipe (9) having pipe flow characteristics.  <image>
