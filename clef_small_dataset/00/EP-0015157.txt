<ABSTRACT>
in the process of the present invention an aqueous solu­ tion is flash vaporized under a reduced pressure to form,  simultaneously, a low pressure water vapour and ice crystals,  the ice formed may, if desired, be purified and is then melted  inside thermally conductive conduits under a high pressure  of, for example, 600 atm.  the low pressure water vapour is  desublimed to form ice on the exterior of the conduits.  the  latent heat of desublimation released may be utilized in sup­ plying the heat needed in the ice-melting operation.  the  desublimate is removed intermittently by an in-situ dissolu­ tion operation utilizing an aqueous solution such as the feed  solution.  a substantially equivalent amount of ice is formed  inside the conduits by an exchange freezing operation.  the ice  so formed is also melted.    an apparatus is provided for carrying out such a process
