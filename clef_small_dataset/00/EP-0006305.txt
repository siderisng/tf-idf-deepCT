<ABSTRACT>
compounds of formula i    in which r¹ and r² each is lower alkyl, cyclo(lower)alkyl,  lower alkoxy(lower)alkylene, phenyl or phenyl mono- or  disubstituted with lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halo, nitro or  trifluoromethyl; or r¹ and r² together form a  -(ch₂)m-x-(ch₂)n-­ chain wherein m and n each is an integer from one to four  and x is methylene, oxa or thia; or r¹ and r² together with  the carbon atom to which they are joined form a spiro-­ [1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene]-1 or spiro[indan]-1 radi­ cal; r³ is hydrogen or lower alkyl; and r⁴ is hydrogen, low­ er alkyl, cyclo(lower)alkyl, phenyl(lower)alkylene, amino­ (lower)alkylene, lower alkylamino(lower)alkylene, di(low­ er alkyl)amino(lower)alkylene or 3-pyridinyl(lower)alkyl­ ene, or a therapeutically acceptable addition salt thereof  are disclosed which possess hypolipidemic activity, and  can be used in pharmaceutical compositions.  the compounds of formula i may be prepared by cy­ clising a corresponding compound of formula x    and if desired esterifying.  tetrahydropyran-2,3,5-trione inter­ mediates are also disclosed.
