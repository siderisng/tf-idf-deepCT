<ABSTRACT>
a fault-finding apparatus (10) is provided for monitoring  a system such as a data communications system.  the  apparatus (10) includes processing means (15) for processing  signals of the system to ascertain whether there is a fault in  the system.  the apparatus (10) also includes indicating means  (17) for indicating a code, when a fault is found by the  processing means (15), indicative of the type of fault or of the  part of the system in which the fault has occurred.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements in or relating to fault-finding apparatuses" the present invention relates to fault-finding apparatuses. for instance, such an apparatus might be used at a remote station of a data communications network for providing an indication of faults occuring at the remote station or in the line connecting the remote station to a central station. according to the invention, there is provided a fault-finding apparatus comprising means for receiving signals from a system to be tested, means for processing the received signals to ascertain whether there is a fault in the system, and indicating means responsive to the processing means for indicating a code indicative of a type of error or a part of the system in which an error has occurred. the apparatus is preferably continuously connected to the system and performs real-time fault-finding. the code is preferably in simplified form, such as a two digit number, and can be referred to a manual containing a list of all the available codes with corresponding technical and/or non-technical descriptions of the types of error and the part of the system in which the error has occurred. this is of advantage in a remote station which is operated by non-technical personnel because, when the apparatus finds a fault and generates, for instance, a two digit "error" code, a non-technical operator can look up the code in the manual and supply the corresponding information to a central station which will generally have technical personnel for dealing with such problems. it may be that the remote station contains pieces of equipment made by different manufacturers, each of which requires the service of the respective manufacturer in the event of a fault. because the manual can provide from the two digit code information as to which piece of equipment is faulty, the appropriate manufacturer or service department can be contacted without delay instead of, for instance, having to call each manufacturer in turn to inspect his respective equipment. the indicating means may comprise means for transmitting the code directly to a central station, for instance in the form of synthetic speech on a telephone line, automatically when a fault is found. alternatively, the indicating means may comprise a display, for instance in the form of a two digit seven segment display. the apparatus may be provided at the remote station of a data communications network having a central station which contains most or all of the data storage and/or processing facilities and which communicates with remote stations, for instance, by means of the telephone -network. the apparatus may include connection means for connecting it to analogue and digital sides of a modem of the remote station, and an interface including an analog-to-digital converter for converting incoming signals received directly from the telephone line or supplied thereto by the modem. the invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a block diagram of a data communications system; figure 2 shows part of the system

<CLAIMS>
ci,aims   1. a fault-finding apparatus comprising means for receiving signals from a system to be tested, means for processing the received signals to ascertain whether there is a fault in the system, and indicating means for indicating a code indicative of a type of fault or a part of the system in which a fault has occurred.   2. an apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the indicating means comprises a display for displaying the code.   3. an apparatus as claimed in claim 2, in which the display is arranged to display the code in numeric form.   4. an apparatus as   cialmed    in claim 3, in combination with a manual in which the numeric codes are listed in juxtaposition with corresponding technical and/or nontechnical descriptions   ofthe    errors.   5. an apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the indicating means comprises means for transmitting the code to a distant part of the system to be tested.   6. an apparatus as claimed in claim 5, in which the transmitting means comprises means for establishing a connection via a standard telephone line with a standard telephone handset situated at the distant part of the system to be tested.     7. an apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6,,in which the transmitting means is arranged to produce signals corresponding to speech for transmission to the distant part of the system   ,to    be tested.   8. an apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which the processing means is arranged to supply a plurality of codes sequentially and repetitively to the indicating means.   9. an apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which the processing means comprises a microprocessing unit including a microprocessor.   10. an apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, for use with a modem of a data communications system, the apparatus including an analogue interface,, for connection to an analogue side of the modem arranged to produce digital signals indicative of whether the frequency and amplitude of signals at the analogue side of the modem within predetermined ranges 11. an apparatus as claim 10, in which the receiving means comprises one or more connectors arranged to be connected in series with connections to the modem and having branch connections to allow the apparatus to be connected continuously to the modem
