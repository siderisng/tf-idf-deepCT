<ABSTRACT>
A heating water control valve for a motor vehicle heating system is proposed, in which in the closed state between the dive anchor and magnet core, only smaller and substantially always moderate axial distance adjusts, whereby the power of the electromagnet can be considerably exploited better. Power consumption and size of the electrical magnet can be reduced. It is also proposed a adjustment method for adjusting the axial pellation of the magnetic core. This results in a Ferti control simplification by tolerance freezing. The control valve contains within a cup-shaped Füh direction sleeve (34) axially below the immersion armature (21) in the guide sleeve axially adjusted and fixed magnetic core (27). The interior of the guide sleeve (34) is waterflow. The magnetic core (27) is clamped by means of radially clamping snap ring (28) on the guide sleeve (34). The acting clamping force is greater than in operation on the magnetic core (27) acting axial forces. The adjustment of the magnetic core (27) is done by pushing it in the guide sleeve (34) to next axially deeper and then a predetermined axial force in closing direction is acted on the dive arm (21), z. b. The magnetic coil (20) in the pulse-like excited current. diving
