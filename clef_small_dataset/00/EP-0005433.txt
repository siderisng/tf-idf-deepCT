<ABSTRACT>
a hold-down beam is provided on a rapid acceleration  conveyor to hold articles, such as an unstable stack of  newspapers, tightly against the conveyor for increasing  frictional engagement between the stack and the conveyor  and move the upper part of the stack with the conveyor so  that the stack will not topple.  the hold-down bar is unpowered,  that is, it is mounted for reciprocation in low-friction  bearings so that its own frictional engagement with the top  of the stack carries it along with the top of the stack until the  stack is brought up to the desired velocity.  a unique cable  system for lowering both ends of a hold-down bar synchronously  through an infinite number of positions and does not  interfere with operation of a strapping machine.  compression  blocks are provided at adjustably spaced locations on the  bar for pressing bowed stacks.
