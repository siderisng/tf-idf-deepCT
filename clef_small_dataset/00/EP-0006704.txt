<ABSTRACT>
a fibrous assembly of many fibers, the individual con­ stituent fibers being interconnected at random in a spaced-­ apart relationship so that when spread in a direction at  right angles to the longitudinals axes of the fibers, said as­ sembly can form a continuous integral reticulated structu­ re; said individual fibers having asymmetrical irregularly-­ shaped cross sections of substantially different profiles and  sizes from one another when said assembly is cut at right  angles to the longitudinal axes of the fibers at an arbitrary  point therealong; at least 40% of the cross-sections of the  fibers consisting of at least two different polymer phases  which are coalesced side-by-side as at least two irregular  blocks; and each of the individual fibers of said assembly  having a non-uniform cross-sectional shape along its lon­ gitudinal axis.  alternatively the constituent fibers can have  a portion wherein the different polymer phases are coales­ ced side-by-side as at least two irregular blocks, and a  portion in which at least one of the polymer phases is se­ parated from the other polymer phase to form finer fibers.   these fibrous assemblies can be used to provide a struc­ ture in the form of a laminate in which at least two fibrous  assemblies are superimposed and each assembly spread in  a direction at right angles to the longitudinal axes of the fi­ bers to form a reticulated structure, and in which many fi­ bers are crimped so that the constituent fibers of the la­ minate are intertwined three-dimensionally.  the assemblies and structures thereof are useful as  reticulated fibrous webs and non-woven fibrous structures,  especially for use as apparel and filter materials.  the fibrous assembly is produced by extruding melts  of at least two different foamable polymer phases in the  form os superimposed layers through an elongated slit, si­ multaneously foaming the polymer phases, and taking up  the extrudate at a high draft ratio while cooling.
