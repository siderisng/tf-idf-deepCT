<ABSTRACT>
a steering linkage for a pair of wheels with upright pivot  axes (a) is comprised of links and pivots.  torque can be  applied to each wheel via pivotal connection (c) to an  intermediate link (1) when control links (2) are pivoted about  their fixed pivots (f) by a drive applied through a tiebar (3).   each wheel can be rotated about its pivot axis by at least  180Â°, and the turning circles of the wheels have a common  centre which, when the wheels are steered, describes a line  parallel to the line which joins the pivot axes of the wheels.  in  a four wheeled vehicle the described line is coincident with  the rotational axes of the second set of wheels.
