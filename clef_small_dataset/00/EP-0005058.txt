<ABSTRACT>
a material and composition are provided for regulating  dopamine or norepinephrine levels in neuronal synapses.   the levels of dopamine and/or norepinephrine are regulated  by administering a neutral amino acid composition to a  patient wherein increased or decreased brain levels of  dopamine and/or norepinephrine are effected when the  composition contains increased or decreased amounts of  tyrosine and/or phenylalanine.  increased or decreased brain  levels of serotonin are obtained when the amino acid  composition contains increased or decreased amounts of  tryptophan.  the neutral amino acid composition can be administered  alone or concomitantly with a drug which increases or  decreases dopaminergic or noradrenergic neurotransmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
a material and composition for regulating dopamine or norepinephrine levels in neuronal synapses this invention is concerned with a material for use in regulating (increasing or decreasing) the amount of dopamine or norepinephrine released into neuronal synapses. the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising such a material. it is known that the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine are derived from dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). dopa is, in turn, produced in neurons by the enzymatic hydroxylation of the amino acid tyrosine. this process is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. the dopa is decarboxylated to dopamine by the enzyme aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (aaad) and norepinephrine is produced from dopamine in neurons that also contain the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase. it is also known that within this reaction chain, the rate-limiting step is the conversion of tyrosine to dopa. for this reason, dopa has been administered to patients who suffer medical disability resulting from dopamine deficiency in diseases such as parkinsonls disease. unfortunately, dopa, when administered, is taken up by cells throughout the body and converted to dopamine and this interferes with the normal metabolic processes in these other cells. in addition, dopa interferes with the body's normal storage of the neurotransmitter serotonin, and lowers brain levels of the compound 5-adenosylmethionine. it is believed that these effects contribute to such unwanted side-effects as the "on-off phenomenon" and, in some patients, psychotic symptoms. other types of drugs that act by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in synapses include the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (which slow the destruction of these neurotransmitters) and the tricyclic antidepressants; these compounds, which are used in treating diseases like depression; also relatively non-specific - producing many chemical effects besides increasing synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine levels - and thus have a range of unwanted side-effects such as the dangerous increases in blood pressure that occur when peoples receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors eat certain foods. other diseases appear to be caused by the presence of excessive quantities of dopamine or norepinephrine within synapses including psychosis (too much dopamine), movement disorders like tardive dyskinesia and the gilles de la tourette syndrome (too much dopamine), and hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias (too much norepinephrine released from sympathetic neurons). these diseases now usually are treated by drugs that block the interactions of dopamine or norepinephrine with their post-synaptic receptors, such as phenothiazines or butyrophenones. however, these agents all exhibit some non-specific actions as well, and thus cause side-effects. prior attempts to increase or decrease the levels of dopamine or norepinephrine by modifying neuronal tyrosine levels had been deemed unsuccessful because the total amounts of these compounds in brains and tissues were not noted to change. it was first observed in wurtman et al (science 185:183-184, july 12, 1974) that increases in brain dopa concentrations, which, under the conditions of the experiments, varied in proportion to the rates at which dopamine and norepinephrine were being synthesized could be obtained by increasing brain tyrosine concentrations, and that decreases in brain dopa concentrations could be produced by giving rats treatments

claims:    1. a material for use in regulating the amount of dopamine or norepinephrine released into synapses in the brain, characterised by a neutral amino acid   which    is tyrosine, phenylalanine or a mixture thereof (with or without other neutral amino acids) and is effective to regulate blood plasma levels of tyrosine or phenylalanine to form corresponding amounts of dopamine and/or norepinephrine in the brain.    2. a material according to   clan    1 wherein said amino acid is tyrosine and also comprising   tryptophan    in an amount to increase or decrease brain serotonin levels.    3. a material according to claim 1 characterised by tyrosine and phenylalanine, the amount of phenylalanine being less than that which competes with tyrosine for uptake into the brain.    4. a material according to claim 1 for use in the treatment of a disease that causes dopamine-releasing neurons to be active and containing tyrosine or phenylalanine.    5. a material according to claim 1 characterised by association with a drug   which    induces an increase or decrease in dopaminergic neurotransmission.    6. a material according to claim 1 characterised by association with a drug which induces an increase or decrease in noradrenergic neurotransmission.    7. a composition in pharmaceutical dosage form comprising material according to any one of the preceding claims.        8.    a pharmaceutical composition comprising an excipient and material according to any one of claims   1    to 6.     9. a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) a drug which, when administered to a human haring active dopamine-releasing neurons increases or decreases   dopaminergic    neurotransmission and (b) a neutral amino acid   which    comprises tyrosine, phenylalanine or   mixture    of tyrosine and phenylalanine to increase or decrease dopaminergic   nurotransmission,     10. a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) a drug which, when adminstered to a human, increases or decreases dopaminergic neurotransmission and (b) a neutral amino acid which comprises tyrosine, phenylalanine or mixtures of tyrosine and phenylalanine (with or without other neutral amino acids) to increase or decrease brain norepinephrine levels.
