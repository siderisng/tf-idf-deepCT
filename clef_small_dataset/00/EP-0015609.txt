<ABSTRACT>
wet-laid paper having, when creped, improved bulk,  softness, and flexibility; a relatively large cross-machine-­ direction to machine-direction stretch ratio; and improved  burst to total tensile stremgth ratio.  the paper is charac­ terized by an array of uncompressed zones (42) which are  in staggered relation in both the machine direction and the  cross-machine direction; and by having each uncompres­ sed zone defined by a picket-lik discontinuous lineament  of compacted fibrous material (43).  the invention also  includes a process for making the paper through the use of  an imprinting fabric which is configured to precipitate the  requisite compacting of the picket-like lineaments prior to  final drying and creping of the paper.
