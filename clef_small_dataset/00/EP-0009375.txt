<ABSTRACT>
the invention for a liquid supply system for a multi-­ occupied building having a plurality of distribution levels  therein and comprises a plurality of riser mains (15) ex­ tending from a service main (10) to a multiple outlet distri­ butor (16) disposed in each dwelling, each riser main (15)  being formed of cross-linked polyethylenic material and  wherein means are included for regulating the liquid flow  either to the distributor from the riser main or from each  outlet of the riser main thereby providing a substantially  constant flow rate of pressure in each of said outlets.  where  a dwelling has up to three storeys a separate riser main  (15) is employed for each storey and from three to ten  storeys a double riser main (15) is employed for the first  three storeys whereupon a single riser main (15) extends  upwardly from the first storey.  the invention provides a  economic advantage inasmuch as the system in accordance  wth the invention may be based on three standardised  pipe sizes.
