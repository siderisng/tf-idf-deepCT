<ABSTRACT>
in a printer having a print head assemblage (18) longitudinally  moving along a path parallel to a record medium (16) a  portion of the print head assemblage is controlled to strike the  record medium at a desired point by measuring the time  required for sonic pulses generated in a rod (36) at the position  of the print head assemblage to arrive at a sensor, (34)  such time being a function of the distance from the print head  assemblage to the sensor.  a representation of this time is  compared against a similar representation of a time associated  with the position of the desired point and upon equality  the portion of the print head assemblage is driven toward the  record medium.
