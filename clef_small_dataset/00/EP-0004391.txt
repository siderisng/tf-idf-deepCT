<ABSTRACT>
the use of an internally plasticized vinyl chloride film  and a fabric backing, preferably a nonflame retardant fabric  backing, as the substrate in a vinyl film/substrate laminate  yields a product having a lower rate of smoke generation  when burned than is produced by a conventional  laminate of an externally plasticized vinyl film and a fabric  backing.  the internally plasticized vinyl chloride resin used  in the vinyl film of the laminate of this invention may be  a copolymer comprising from about 50% to about 85%,  by weight, vinyl chloride, from about 3% to about 47%, by  weight, of a c₆-c₁₀ alkyl acrylate, and from about 47% to  about 3%, by weight, of a bis(hydrocarbyl)vinylphosphonate.   the vinyl film/substrate laminate of the present invention  is useful as an upholstery product.
