<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for feeding water to a machine for washing table-ware or linen provided with a resin water softener (8) and with a container (9) for regenerator salt for the resin, and having nozzles (11, 12) for the provision of water along converging axes and a reservoir (19) provided with an overflow, characterized in that, in its realisation at least functions for the provision of water from the mains, for providing softened water, for providing water for the regeneration of the resin of the softener, and for the regulation of this regeneration of the resin, this device for feeding water (7) being formed in a single piece, comprising in the first place three compartments (15, 18, 19) horizontally aligned, communicating between them and with the outside air forming an entry chamber (15), an intermediate chamber (18) and a reservoir (19), in the second place two entry nozzles (11, 12) mounted with their ends emptying into this entry chamber (15) and with their axes converging downstream of which one crosses the opening connecting these three compartments (15, 18, 19), in the third place, two passages (16, 21) respectively extending the entry chamber (15) and the intermediate chamber (18) in order to put them in communication with the vat (4) of the machine (1), in the fourth place in this reservoir (19) a device for regulating the level of the water (35) which controls the regeneration of the softener resin, and a zigzag passage (31) for limiting the flow, formed at the bottom of the reservoir (19) and putting it in connection with the container for salt for the regeneration of the resin (9).
