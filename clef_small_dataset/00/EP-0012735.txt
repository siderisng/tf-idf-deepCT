<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for controlling target tracking,  in which the setting is made by distance and velocity incre­ ments.  the velocity increment is calculated and supplied to  the control by command from a push-button (1) on the  operating means of the target tracker.  the velocity incre­ ment is selected proportional to the distance increment and  inversely proportional to the measured time between two  sequential reversals of the switch (1) on the operating  means.

<DESCRIPTION>
a mfthod and¯apparaius for target tracking field of the invention the present invention relates to a method for controlling target tracking and apparatus for carrying out the method. description of prior art in controlling target tracking, for example when controlling a sighting means for aiming a weapon on a moving target, it is known to the art to use rate control together with distance increments, see for example the patent specificsticn number 153 244, especially figure 4 and the description applicable thereto. target tracking is often carried out by an aimer who aims the sight laterally and in height. up to now it has been usual, in the operation of the sighting means, that the quotient between distance and velocity increments has been a constant, which has had the diensicn of time and has therefore been called the time constant t. different target tracking tasks require different settings of said quotient. when tracking a rapid target at a short distan-e with an anti-aircraft weapon sight a low value of the time constant t must be set, but when controlling a tracking mark in tracking targets on a radar plan position indicator (ppi) where the targets only move slowly, setting to a considerably larger value is required. it is obvious to make said quotient settable to the value suitable for every task and for every aimer. however, it is rather difficult to select the setting value most suitable for every occasion. summary of the invention in accordance with the present invention, the time is measured between each correction made by the aimer, and the rate increment shall be in direct portion to the distance increment introduced and in inverse proportion to the measured time. for example, when tracking a target on the ppi of a radar installation, a joystick is used for controlling a tracking mark longitudinally and transversely, and when a set correction is to be introduced into the computing portion of the tracking means, this is ordered by the aimer. the distinguishing features for the invention are set forth in the characterizing portion of the accompanying patent claims. brief description of the drawings in the following there is described an example of the method for target tracking, and apparatus for carrying out the method, where the calculations for said tracking are done digitally. the appended figures are referred to in the description, where figure 1 is a time diagram over the tracking sequence and figure 2 is a principle diagram of the apparatus circuitry. preferred embodiment the description primarily refers to tracking a moving target on the ppi of a radar installation. a tracking mark on the indicator, which is to be placed over the target and accompany it, is movable along the x- and y-axes. controlling the mark is done in the same way in both directions, and it is therefore sufficient solely to describe controlling along the x-axis hereinafter. the principle for correcting the movement of the controlled tracking mark is apparent from the time diagram in

<CLAIMS>
we claim:   1 a method of controlling a sighting means provided with an operating means, a computing means, a driving means and a display means, for tracking a moving target, in which method there are the following procedural steps: - changing the setting of the operating means of the sighting means in response to deviation shown on the display means between the attitude of the sighting means and the position of the target - calculation in the computing means of both a positional change and a velocity change of the sighting means corresponding to the change in setting, - steering the sighting means with the aide of its driving means to the calculated position and the calculated velocity,  characterized in that the velocity change of the sighting means is selected proportional to its positional change and inversely proportional to a measured time   (t),    measured from the instant for the previous nearest velocity change to the instant for the current velocity change.   2 apparatus for carrying out the method in accordance with claim 1, for controlling a sighting means provided with an operating means, a computing means, a driving means and a display means, for tracking a moving target, said operating means being adapted for emitting a signal (   ax)    to affect both the position of the sighting means and its velocity, characterized by a switch (1) with contacts for sending commands as to the correction of the sighting means velocity on reversal, and by there being incorporated in the calculating unit: : - a time counter (4) for measuring the time interval   (t)    between two sequential operations of the switch (1) and for sending an output signal the magnitude (at) of which is proportional to the measured time interval, - a division means (5) for dividing the operating means signal   c a    x) by said time counter output signal (at) to give a quotient signal ( a x/at) (c) when the switch (1) is reversed     first    time lag and addition unit (2) for integrating the quotient   signal    - an adder (6) for adding the output signal of the first time lag and addition unit with the input signal (   ax)    of the operating means,   when the switch is reversed - a second time lag and addition unit   (3)    for integrating the output signal from the adder (6) and - a second adder (7) for adding the output signal of the second time lag and addition unit (3) with an input signal when the switch is unactuated (   ax)    from the operating means to form a signal for controlling the driving means.
