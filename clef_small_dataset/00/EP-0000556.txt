<ABSTRACT>
a system for testing the dental pulp of a tooth by electrically  stimulating the pulp with a pulsating signal having a  continuously increasing amplitude.  the system includes a  probe (12) having an electrode (78) adapted to contact the  tooth, and a contact detection device for sensing when the  probe electrode makes contact with the tooth.  at initial probe  contact the contact detection device (82,98) causes the amplitude  of the stimulus to start increasing from an initial value.   the intensity continues to increase as long as the probe electrode  (78) is in contact with the tooth.  the electrical stimulus  may be generated by a voltage controlled pulse generator  (28) driving the primary of a transformer (66), with the secondary  of the transformer connected between the probe  electrode (78) and another electrode (74) in electrical contact  with the patient.  the transformer (66) has a relatively low  cutoff frequency so that the amplitude of the signal across  the secondary is proportional to the pulse width of the  incoming signal.  consequently, as the control voltage (36,38)  to the voltage control pulse generator (28) increases, the  amplitude of the pulses across the secondary also increases.   the voltage control pulse generator (28) drives a counter (54,100),  and the output of the counter is indicated on a digital  display (102,104).  since the amplitude of the control voltage  is a function of the number of pulses generated by the pulse  generator (28), the output of the counter (54,100) indicates  the amplitude of the electrical stimulus.  alternatively, a ramp  generator (200,210) having its output connected to one end  of the primary periodically grounded responsive to fixed frequency,  fixed duration pulses from the output of an oscillator.   consequently, the amplitude of the pulses across the  secondary of the transformer (66) increases with time.
