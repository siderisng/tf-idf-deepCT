<ABSTRACT>
a coupling (8) for a flexible shaft (10) for a pump rotor  (12) orbiting within a stator (13).  coupling of the shaft (10) to  a driving or driven member is made easily by screwing the  end (10. 1) of the shaft (10) by hand into a socket (12. 1) in the  member (12), and by then locking the shaft (10) against rotation  in the socket (12. 1) by means of abutting complementary  oblique faces (18. 1; 10. 12) at the end of the shaft (10) and at  the end of the locking element (18) in the transverse bore (16)  intersecting the socket (12. 1).  the screwing in of the shaft  (10) into the socket (12. 1) need not to be more than fingertight.
