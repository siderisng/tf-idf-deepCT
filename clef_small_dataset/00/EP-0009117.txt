<ABSTRACT>
in known plug connections, the ends of the wave guides are provided with plug-in circular mountings.  the fitting of the circular mountings is possible only in a special workshop.  the object of the invention is to provide a plug-in connection which can be mounted at the place of application as well, without special auxiliary means.  the connection according to the invention is characterised in that the ends of the optical wave guides (2) are centred in v-shaped grooves (3) of the end pieces (4) and are compactly clamped at their end surface by means of a clamping piece (9).  <image>
