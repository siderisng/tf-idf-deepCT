<ABSTRACT>
a hinged closure has a cap part (1) and an integral band  (3) adapted to be separated circumferentially from one  another except for a narrow interconnecting hinge (15) by  removing a partial arcuate tear band (2) between the cap part  and the anchor band and then applying upward pressure  upon the cap part so as to tear two remaining arcuate memÂ­ branes (13) which connect the tear band with the hinge.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements in and relating to hinged closures for containers" fl field of the invention this invention relates to hinged closures for bottles and the like hereinafter simply called containers. brief description of the prior art the hinged closures to which the invention relates comprise a. cap part, a tear band, an anchor band and a hinge to connect the cap part -to the anchor band. these hinged closures bave in the past few years achieved a very considerable success commercially and our hinged closures known under the registered trade mark jaycap and manufactured under british patent no. 812580 are to be wound on many different containers including bottles of still soft drink such as orange squash. so far it has not proved possible to use ou jaycaps on containers of aerated drinks because the internal pressure has created practical problems among which we should mention:- a) tile pressure inside bottles of a beverage such as tonic water may be as much as i2op.s.i. and this has proved to be sufficient to blow our normal jaycaps right off the bottle. b) in cases in which our jaycaps have held iu position the pressure inside the bottle has caused a leakage so that the beverage has gone flat. c) when removing the tear band the cap part has been blown open with such force that an injury could be sustained by the pelson o))ening the bottle. su@@@ary of the, present invention @ have t@@reiore carried out a series of experiments with vi@@ to designing a speeial hinged @losure adapted for use @@i@arily with a container the content of which is aerated. according to the present invention a hinged closure for closing tile mouth of a container comprises a cap part, au integral anchor band adapted to embrace the neck of the container or that part of the container wall adjacent tulle mouth of the container and means for separating the anchor band from the cap part circumferentially except over e narrow intereonne eting zone which constitutes a hinge, wherein the means for separating the anchor band from. the cap part includes an arcuate partial tear band and at least one arcuate area of weakness. each of the problems mentioned above has required special attention nd a soiution is based upon the provision of a hinged closure iu accordance with the statement above and prele having the additional following features:- a) we make the closure sufficiently strong to stay in position even with substantial pressure building up inside. this may be done by thickening the material of which the closure is made, by providing a bead of substantial size inside the anchor, by making the closure of a stronger jnateria than heretofore (e.g. a plastics composition made up of about 90% low density polyethylene and about 10% high density polyethylene and by @ishing the top of the cap part of the is resisted and @losure so that pressure @xisted inside/ at least partially expands itself by pushing ip the dished part. b) we

   ldat    is claimed is:   1. a hinged closure for closing the mouth of a container comprisin.   a cap part, an integral anchor band adapted to embrace the neck of the container or that part of the container wall adjacent the mouth of the container and means for separating the anchor band from the cap part circumferentially   csccp-1;    over a   narrow    interconnecting zone which constitutes a hinge, wherein the means for separating the anchor band   from    the cap part includes an arcuate   pal-lial    tear band and at least one arcuate area of weakness.   2. a hinged closure according to claim 1 wherein   the    means for separating the anchor band groin the   cap    part comprises an arcuate partial tear band opposed to the interconnecting zone constituting the hinge, and a line of   weakness      cn    each   side of    the   hinge    between the tear band and the   hinge.      3. a a hinged closure according to claim 2 wherein the arcuate tear band extends for 900.   4. a hinged closure according to claim 2   wherein    each of the membrane or posts lines of weakness includes a   thickened    patr/ which resists tearing so that after the partial tear band is   torn      away    a   perti@    of the cap part   flexes      upwards    until the thickened pos-is tear, ti: flexing   action    permitting pressure within a container to   be    released in a controlled   manner.      5. a hinged closure according to   claim    2 wherein the tear band is joined to the cap part and the anchor   part      by      a   thin  membrane, the membrane and arcuate lines of weakness having a thickness of between 0.008" -   0.022".      6. a hinged closure according to claim 1 wherein the cap part   has    an   internal      depending    cylindrical plug adapted to elltcr and seal   against    the   internal      wall    of a container mouth.   7. a hinged closure according to claim 6 wherein the outer wall of the plug has an annular sealing   bcad      and    two   annular    lamellas in use to seal against the internal   wall    of a container mouth.    8. a hinged closure according to claim 6 wherein the plug is deeper on one side than on the   other,    the deepest part of the plug being adjacent the   hitige    so that   ti'1e      deepest    part forms an abutment which, when the closure has been opened, cooperates   with    the   container    mouth sn as to releasably retain the cap part in the open position.   9. a   hinged    closure according to claim   ,    wherein the   anchor    band includes   two    annular retaining beads.   10. a hinged closure according to claim 1 wherein the   cap      part      has    a dished top to resist pressure.
