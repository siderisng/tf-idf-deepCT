<ABSTRACT>
hydraulic bolt tightening means comprises a body (10),  a piston (16, 18) mounted in the body, the piston (16, 18) and  the body (10) being of generally annular configuration to  allow the device to be assembled in encircling fashion to a  bolt or like component (44), and an annular chamber (12)  between the body (10) and the piston (16, 18) for the  admission of fluid under pressure to effect relative axial  displacement of the body (10) and the piston (16, 18) whereby  the axial dimension is increased, the piston comprising an  inner part (16) having a pressure area which is subject to the  pressure in said chamber (12) and an outer part (18) to which  the fluid pressure is transmitted via said inner part (16) and  an interposed mass of solid, yielding and substantially  incompressible material (20) received in a recess or groove  in said outer piston part (18) and whose effective pressure  area is less than that of said inner piston part whereby, in  use, said mass is caused to expand radially so as to seal  against leakage of fluid from the chamber (12) while at the  same time transmitting the pressure to the outer piston part  (18).
