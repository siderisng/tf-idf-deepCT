<ABSTRACT>
1.  tetrahydrofurane derivatives of the formula i  see diagramm : ep0000002,p22,f6  in which r**1 to r**6 are identical or different and represent hydrogen, straight-chain or branched c1-6 alkyl, c1-2 halogenalkyl with up to three identical or different halogen atoms, alkoxyalkyl with 1 or 2 c atoms in each alkyl part, as well as phenyl or benzyloxyalkyl with 1 or 2 c atoms in the alkyl part each optionally substituted by halogen, c1-2 alkyl, c1-2 alkoxy or c1-2 halogenoalkyl with up to three identical or different halogen atoms, r**5 and r**6 together also represent a saturated carboxylic ring with altogether 3 to 6 c atoms, r**7 represents hydrogen, straight-chain or branched c1-6 alkyl, c3-6 cycloalkyl, c2-4 alkenyl, c2-4 alkinyl, alkoxyalkyl with 1 to 2 c atoms in each alkyl part, as well as phenyl or benzyloxyalkyl with 1 or 2 c atoms in the alkyl part each substituted by halogen, c1-2 alkyl, c1-2 alkoxy, or c1-2 halogenoalkyl with up to three identical or different halogen atoms, r**8 and r**9 are identical or different and represent hydrogen, straight-chain or branched c1-6 alkyl, c2-4 alkenyl, c2-4 alkinyl, c3-6 cycloalkyl, c1-4 alkoxy, as well as phenyl, benzyl or benzyloxy each optionally substituted by halogen, c1-2 alkyl, c1-2 alkoxy or c1-2 halogenoalkyl with up to three identical or different halogen atoms, r**10 represents hydrogen, straight-chain or branched c1-6 alkyl, c2-4 alkenyl, c2-4 alkinyl, c1-2 halogenoalkyl with up to three identical or different halogen atoms, as well as phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, c1-2 alkyl, c1-2 alkoxy or c1-2 halogenoalkyl with up to three identical or different halogen atoms and y represents optionally substituted aryl with 6 to 10 c atoms, which can carry one or more identical or different substituents from the following : the halogens fluorine, chlorine or bromine ; alkyl and alkoxy with in each case 1 to 4 c atoms ; halogenoalkyl, halogenoalkoxy and halogenoalkylthio with in each case up to 4 c atoms and up to 5 halogen atoms ; phenyl, phenoxy or phenoxycarbonyl optionally substituted by halogen, alkyl and alkoxy with in each case 1 to 2 c atoms as well as halogenalkyl with up to 1 c atoms and up to 3 identical or different halogen atoms as well as halogenoalkyl with up to 1 c atoms and up to 3 identical or different halogen the tri-, tetra- or penta-methylene radical ; with the proviso that if y represents phenyl this must be substituted if r**1 to r**10 denote hydrogen.
