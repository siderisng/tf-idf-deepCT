<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to herbicidal agents characterized by a content of a N-azolylmethyl halogen acetanilide of formula I in the R hydrogen, a unbranched or branched alkyl or alkoxy radical having up to 5 carbon atoms, R¹ hydrogen, halogen, unbranched or bulged alkyl or alkoxy radical with up to 5 carbon fathers, R² hydrogen, halogen, a unbranched or twig-bent alkyl or alkoxy radical with up to 5 carbon fatomas, R together with R² ene orthostistantly linked, by unbranched alkyl groups with up to 4 carbon atoms substituted by unbranched alkyl groups Alkylene chain with up to 6 carbon atoms, x chlorine or bromine and a azole bound via a ring nitrogen atom, which is simple or multiple by halogen, phenyl, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio or perfluoroalkyl radicals having up to 4 carbon atoms, cyan, carboxy, Carbalkoxy with up to 4 carbon atoms in the alkoxy group or alkanoyl radicals can be substituted with up to 4 carbon atoms, wherein A may also stand for salts of the 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms containing azoles, and a halogen acetanilide of the formula II in the r of unbranched or branched alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl each with up to 4 each Carbon atoms or the radical A-R¹, wherein A for an alkylene residue having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, which may optionally be easily or substituted by ethyl or substituted by methyl, and R¹ for unbranched or branched alkyloxy, haloalkyloxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy or Alkoxyalkyloxy having up to 4 carbon atoms, cycloalkyloxy, or cycloalkylme thyloxy having 3 to 6 carbon atoms in the cycloalkyl ring, 1,3-dioxolane-2-yl or alkoxycarbonyl having up to 4 carbon atoms in the alkoxy radical, x chlorine or bromine and Y¹ and y² are equal or different and hydrogen or unbranched or branched alkyl with up to To 4 carbon atoms mean, provided that Y¹ and Y² are only hydrogen when R is uninterrupted or branched alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl having up to 4 carbon atoms each. The mixing ratio N-azolylmethylhalogen acetanilide of the formula I: halogen acetanilide of the formula II is 1: 0.5 to 1: 10 parts by weight.
