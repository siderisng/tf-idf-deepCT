<ABSTRACT>
gang saws and other cutting apparatus having oscillating  cutters for cutting workpieces into slices.  the apparatus  has two elongate spaced apart cutter supports (12, 13) which  are driven to oscillate 180Â° out of phase with each other.  two  sets of cutters (11) are connected to the supports.  for a  suitable workpiece the cutters may be of a hot wire type.   each cutter (32) of one set (11) is connected to the first  support (13, 47) by a resiliently extensible connector such as  a spring (34) and to the second support (12, 47) by a  non-extensible connection.  each cutter (32) of the other set  (11) is connected to the second support (12, 47) by a  resiliently extensible connector (35) and to the first support  (13, 47) by a non-extensible connection.  desirably the cutters  of one set alternate with cutters of the other and all cutters  are coplanar.  movement of cutters of each set in opposite  directions tends to cancel the local influence of cutters on the  workpiece.  moreover whole frame of cutters may be  removed and replaced, facilitating reprogramming of the  apparatus in terms of spacings between cutters.
