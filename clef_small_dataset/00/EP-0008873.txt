<ABSTRACT>
a method of treating flat glass to reduce its vulnerability  to scratching, e. g.  during storage and/or transit, wherein a  transparent film of a cationic surface active agent is  adsorbed on the glass by applying an aqueous solution of  the surface active agent to the glass on the production line  and drying the glass.  the cationic surface active agent is preferably one which  is positwely charged in the aqueous positively solution, e. g.  a quater­ nary ammonium salt such as an alkyl dimethyl benzyl  ammonium chloride.  a concentration of 0. 001% to 2%, pref­ erably of the order of 0. 02%, of the cationic surface active  agent may be used.  the treatment of the flat glass is carried out in an  apparatus installed on the production line.  it comprises  means (15, 16) for supplying a solution of treatment agent to  at least one major surface of the glass (10), a collector (26) for  collecting solution flowing from the glass, means for recycl­ ing at least a proportion of solution from the collector to the  supply means and a reservoir (23) arranged for connection to  the supply means for holding fresh treatment solution and  supplying it to the supply means.
