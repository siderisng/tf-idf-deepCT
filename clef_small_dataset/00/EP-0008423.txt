<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for the heat treatment of an elongated sheet, in particular for anti-corrosion treatment of sheet metal from a zirconium alloy, which must be experienced after the elevator a very rapid cooling.The sheet (18) is passed from rolls through the arrangement, in which a heating element (20, 21) is in a treatment room (17), which is passed from the sheet.The treatment room (17) is filled with protective gas.It is on the one hand of wall surfaces directed to the heating element (20, 21) and form a heating element (19) enclosing the heating element, and on the other hand of surfaces of several walst pockets (49) directed with its opening on the sheet (18),limited.The roller bags comprise the rollers to form a gap (49) over the largest part of their scope.
