<ABSTRACT>
water-absorbent, starch copolymerisates which comprise  a non-linear lattice of starch chains linked together by  polymeric linkages represented by the formula    wherein starch represents a starch chain of d-glucose units,  z represents an organo group which links the    group to the carbon atom of the starch chain by a sulphur or  an oxygen atom, r is hydrogen or a monovalent organic  radical, m represents a plurality of copolymerised ethylenically  unsaturated monomers with "p" representing the  number of copolymerised monomeric units in the linkage,  (w) is a water-attractant group linked to the polymeric linkage  and "n" represents the number of (w) moieties contained  within the polymeric linkage of the copolymerised  monomers with the number of (w) moieties being sufficient  to impart water-absorbency properties to the copolymerisate.   the water-absorbent starch copolymerisate may be  easily prepared into a desired configuration for a particular  end-use or combined with other substrates or carriers.  the  unpolymerised starch and monomers or precursors thereof  may be applied or incorporated into a suitable carrier or substrate  and copolymerised in situ to provide a composite article  of unitary construction with the water-absorbent starch  copolymerisate permanently bonded or affixed thereto.
