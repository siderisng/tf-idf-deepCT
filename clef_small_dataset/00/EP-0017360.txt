<ABSTRACT>
deposition of continuous pin-hole free tellurium films  with thicknesses to less than 150a on a suitable substrate is  achieved by first pretreating the substrate prior to film  deposition.  ion sputtering or bombardment of the substrate  surface with an inert gas prior to tellurium evaporation  creates a dense coverage of nucleation sites on the substrate  which improves the adhesiveness and resistance to abrasion  and oxidation of the deposited film while providing very thin  pin-hole free films of uniform thickness and desired crystalÂ­ lite orientation.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of pretreating a substrate, method and apparatus for pretreating a substrate and depositing a thin metallic film thereon, and optical recording apparatus produced thereby this invention relates to a method of pretreating a substrate, the method comprising providing a working gas environment in a chamber in a self-contained system, and generating a plasma in said chamber. the invention is also concerned with a-method and apparatus for pretreating the substrate and depositing a thin metallic film thereon, as well as an optical recording medium produced by the method. in recent years there has been significant interest in the development of ablative optical recording media for permanent storage of data by means of a modulated laser beam which selectively ablates a thin film material having a high energy absorbing characteristic provided on a suitable substrate. one such thin film material is tellurium, which is disclosed extensively in the technical and patent literature, such as, u. s. patent 4,000,334. tellurium is one of the most preferred materials for an ablative material because of its high sensitivity relative to other successfully ablative materials. conventionally known methods of depositing thin layers of tellurium on a substrates has been by employing sputtering or vapor deposition techniques. however, thin films below 300 to 400a have generally been plagued with pin-holes and other film discontinuities and have exhibited poor film thickness uniformity and adhesion and have not been adaptable for commercialization. some materials do not adhere to various types of dielectric substrate materials with standard deposition methods. tellurium is one such material. the principle reason for this difficulty is that the substrate material has no means for a chemical and/or physical reaction between the metal being deposited and the substrate material to provide the desired adhesiveness. precoating the substrate with a discontinuous thin gold layer prior to tellurium deposition has been applied to improve film adhesion. however, for films below 200a, the films exhibit pin-holes and nonuniformity in thickness. it is desirable to produce very thin films of this ablatively sensitive material to thereby (1) maximize sensitivity, (2) minimize the effect on sensitivity that may result from employing a protective overcoating (3) minimize the effect of thickness variations of the writing layer on the recording disc relative to writing sensitivity and (4) maximize the signal noise ratio upon readout. the present invention is intended to enable such thin films to be deposited, and accordingly, provides a method of pretreating a substrate in a plasma which is characterised by raising the appied voltage to said plasma while reducing the chamber pressure thereby obtaining highly energetic ions having high mobility, causing-the highly energetic ions to accelerate toward said substrate and bombarding the surface of said substrate with said ions thereby sputtering the surface of said substrate. the invention also provides a method of depositing a thin metallic film on a substrate comprising pretreating-the substrate by the method of the preceding paragraph, and vapour depositing a thin film on the bombarded surface of said substrate. furthermore, the invention provides an
