<ABSTRACT>
a non-aqueous secondary cell having a conventional  alkali metal anode and a cathode which contains as the  active material a chalcogenide having the nominal atom  composition mxn1-xs₂ in which m is mn, fe, ni, or co, or  mixtures thereof, n is v or cr or mixtures thereof, and x is  less than or equal to 0. 5 when n is v and m is fe, less than or  equal to 0. 33 when n is v and m is ni, co₂ or mn, and less  than 0. 33 when n is cr.  said chalcogenide is prepared by adding an oxidizing  agent having an oxidizing potential of at least 2. 8 volts to a  compound with formula liymxn1-xs₂, in which y is less than  or equal to 1.
