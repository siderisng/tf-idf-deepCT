<ABSTRACT>
a valve bag has a valve opening in which a valve sleeve  extending into the interior of the bag, is fixed by means of  a mountant.  the valve sleeve consists of a supporting sheet  (1) and a lip valve sheet (2) of thin porous airpermeable  material which is adhered to the supporting sheet along  two opposite edges.  the face of the supporting sheet  turned towards the lip valve sheet is formed, between the  points where the two sheets are adhered together, of a  material to which the mountant does not adhere.
