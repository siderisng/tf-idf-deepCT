<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a process for the recovery  of manganese from aqueous acidic solution.  the process comprises the steps of, (a) introducing into  the solution peroxymonosulphuric acid (pms) in a plurality of  stages, normally from 2 to 6, often in the range of from 110 to  160% of the amount theoretically needed to oxidise the manganese  to the mn (iv) oxidation state, (b) introducing from 100  to 133% of the theoretical amount of neutralising agent to  neutralise the pms introduced in step (a), preferably in a  single addition and prior to the introduction of the second  stages of pms and, (c) separating precipitated manganese  salt from solution.  the demanganisation reaction is preferably  carried out at a temperature of above 60° usually in the  range of 70 to 90°c.  an aqueous acidic manganese-containing solution can  be obtained by leaching ores or scrap metal with strong mineral  acids.  the present invention is particularly suitable for the  purification of zinc sulphate solution.
