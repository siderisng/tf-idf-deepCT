<ABSTRACT>
tubular plastic net is made by extruding plastic material  through coaxial circular counter-rotating die members (11,  13) to form a net structure (18) having a plurality of cross足 ing strands.  the angular displacement of successive longi足 tudinally-aligned junctions of the crossing strands is con足 trolled through control means (20), preferably by con足 trolling the relative counter-rotation of the extrusion die  members (11, 13), and successive longitudinally aligned  junctions are cut longitudinally within each junction by  guiding and cutting means (30).  the net so cut can be  opened out to form flat net in unfolded form.  the flat net in which each edge junction (7) is cut  longitudinally within the junction (7), is particularly useful  for fencing material, for example.
