<ABSTRACT>
a modular shelving system comprises a plurality of tubes  (1) connected together in the desired manner by end and  intermediate connectors (5 and 8).  each connector (5, 8) com­ prises three mutually perpendicular tubes (5a, 5b and 5c; 8a,  8b and 8c).  strengthening flanges (21, 24) on the connectors  (5, 8) serve to support horizontal panels (22) whilst vertical  panels (16) are held by supports (10) engaged with flanges  (23) of the connectors (5, 8).  the system is mounted on adjust­ able feet (14) and is strengthened by a variety of strengtheners  (6, 9, 3) and can be secured to a wall by means of (3a, 4).  a tube  (1a) is suspended by means of support brackets (2) in a plane  below a plane in which lie tubes (1) with which the support  brackets (2) are engaged.  the system is formed of very simple components but is  yet strong and versatile.

<DESCRIPTION>
title "montn;ar¯¯shet,vtncr systemq field to which the invention relates this invention relates to a modular shelving system and more particularly to a kit of parts which can be erected to form a shelving system. disclosure of the invention a very simple, easy to erect, and sturdy modular shelving system comprises basically a plurality of tubes having different lengths but a common diameter, a plurality of connectors for connecting the tubes together so as to produce a shelving structure. a wide variety of different shapes of shelving structure can be produced and the versatility of the shelving unit can be increased by the provision of various different accessory parts. brief description of the drawings fig. 1 is a plan vie of one embodiment of a modular shelving system according to the present invention in an erected condition, fig. 2 is a partial section on the line c-c of fig. 1, fig. 3 is a sectional view in the direction of arrow a-a in fig, -1-, fig. 4 is an elevational view of an adjustable leg with a foot pad for adjustably supporting the modular shelving system, fig. 5 is a view of an adjustable leg with a castor wheel, for supporting the modular shelving system, fig. ó is a sectional view of a connector and a vertical panel support forming part of the modular shelving system of fig. 1, fig. 7 is a section one the line b-b of fig. 6, and fig. 8 is a front elevational view of the modular shelving system of fig. 1. referring now to the drawings, the modular shelving system comprises plurality of tubes 7 which are of differing lengths but of the same external diameter, and a plurality of end connectors 5 and intermediate connectors 8 for joining the tubes is together to form a shelving structure. the end connectors 5 are used exclusively for making corners of the structure. each end connector 5 comprises three sleeves 5a, 5b, and 5c which are of different lengths* the sleeves 5w and 5c are arranged- -with their axes co-planar and 900 apart to define an l, whilst the sleeve 5a is longer than the other two sleeves 5b and 5c a-nd extends with its axis perpendicular to the plane of the l. as can be seen from fig. 1, the sleeve 5a is joined to the sleeve 5c at a location adjacent the external- corner--of the l shape. the sleeve 5a is open at both ends but its closed by a centre partition 20. the sleeves 5b and 5c have their mutually adjacent ends closed so that the same length of tube 1 can be inserted therein. each end connector 5 further includes an integral planar flange 21 which is disposed in the plane in which the axes of the sleeves 5b and 5c lie and which serves as a strengthener between the sleeves 5b and 5c and also as a support for a horizontal shelving panel 22 (see fig. 1). each end connector 5 further
