<ABSTRACT>
guanidine derivatives of the formula:-   het¹-(ch₂)m-y¹-(ch₂)n-nr¹-a-nr²-(ch₂)g- y²-(ch₂)p-  het² (i)   in which y¹ and y² are o, s, direct bonds, ch₂ or so; m and p  are 0 to 4, n and g are 1 to 4, provided that when y¹ or y² is 0, s  or so, m or p is 1 to 4 and provided that when y¹ or y² is 0 or  so, n or g is 2 to 4; one of r¹ and r² is hydrogen and the other  is hydrogen or c(1-6)alkyl; a is e. g.  3,4-dioxocyclobuten-1,  2-diyl or c = z in which z is s, o, ncn, nno₂, chno₂,  nconh₂, c(cn)₂ or nh;   het¹ is cayzol-4-yl, thiazol-4-yl or imidazol-4-yl substi­ tuted in the 2-position by:-    or het¹ is 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl or 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl substi­ tuted in the 5-position by radical iii in which r⁵ is hydrogen,  c(1-10)alkyl, c(1-6)alkanoyl or c(7-11)aroyl; het² is e. g.  same as  het¹ or an optionally substituted unfused n-containing 5- or 6-­ membered monocyclic heterocyclic ring; provided that when  r¹ and r² are hydrogen and a is c = nh, y¹ and/or y² is s, and  that when r¹ and r² are hydrogen; a is c = nh and het² is  imidazole, the number of atoms in the chain:-   (ch₂)g-y²-(ch₂)p   is at least 4;   and salts thereof.  the process of manufacture of said com­ pounds is described; e. g.  2-guanidino-4[(2-aminoethyl)­ thiomethyl]thiazole gives by reaction with carbon disulphide  1,3-bis[2- (2-guanidino-thiazol-4- ylmethyl­ thio)ethyl]₋thiourea.
