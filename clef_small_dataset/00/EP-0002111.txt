<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus is adapted to connect wires in an electrical  connector (10) comprising two housing parts (11, 13)  relatively rotatable to effect the connection and comprises  a frame (62) defining a connector feed path (63) extending  to an operating station (64) means (81) biassing a series of  connectors (10) in tandem relation sequentially along the  path to the terminating station, guide ribs (67) on the frame  for engaging complementary grooves (29) on one housing  part (11) to maintain the one housing part in a predetermined  rotational position while a force applying member  (74, 78) rotates the other housing part.  a stop (68) at an  exit end of the feed path is aligned with a groove (48) in the  connector (10) by the rotation to release the connector  from the apparatus
