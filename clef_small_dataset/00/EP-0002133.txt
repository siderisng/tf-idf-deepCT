<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a positioning servo mechanism  suitable for use in positioning the magnetic heads in a  magnetic disk memory, and in which an actuator is driven  in response to algebraically summed signals representing  commanded position, actual position, and velocity.  in a disk memory the head position may be determined  by counting track crossings, giving a signal which has a  fluctuating component and cannot be differentiated to give  a usable velocity signal.  in the present invention a coarse velocity signal is  generated by integrating and amplifying a signal representing  actuator current.  the coarse velocity signal is integrated  between successive track crossings to give a coarse distance  signal.  this is compared with a signal representing the  actual distance between tracks, and the difference is used  to adjust the gain of the amplifier, so correcting the coarse  velocity signal at each track crossing.  a further correction  my be obtained by adding to the input of the first integrator  an accumulative error correction signal representing the  change in amplifier gain.
