<ABSTRACT>
In embroidery machines, the control is carried out via a strip-shaped hole card (2), wherein the reading is usually mechanically carried out by boards (6) or by electrical or electronic reading devices. SOL che punch cards (2) are often corrected by subsequent added punch holes (5), with the wrong lethometer (5) are glued over. Furthermore, such hole cards very often obtain oil spots which can be transmitted through the card (2) so that the use of electrical or electronic readings also leads to difficulties due to passing hole overlays. Here, the invention is now proposed and it is proposed that the punch card (2) with boards (6) mechanically acknowledge, but then the boards (6) are associated with electric or electrical or electronic switching elements (15) which the movement or the Register a standstill of the boards (6). It can also be ejected mechanically damaged or translucent perforated cards (2), but still need not be dispensed with the advantages of an electrical or electro niche reader (12).
