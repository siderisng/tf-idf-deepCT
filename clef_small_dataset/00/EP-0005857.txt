<ABSTRACT>
a piezoelectric crystal (12) has a concave active surface  and a high acoustical impedance.  a flat layer (15) of molded  material having a low acoustical impedance faces the active  surface of the crystal to form a space therebetween.  an  intermediate layer (16) of molded material having an intermediate  acoustical impedance fills the space between the  crystal and the flat layer.  preferably, the intermediate  material has a sonic velocity near that of water, and the flat  layer has a uniform thickness of approximately 1/4 of the  average wavelength of the ultrasonic energy emitted by the  crystal.  a housing (10) supports the crystal, the flat layer, and  the intermediate layer.
