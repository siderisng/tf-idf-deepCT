<ABSTRACT>
propylene and ethylene may be carbonylated to form  carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids in the presence of a  catalyst complex containing 1 mole of bf₃ and 1 mole of a  second complexing component.  the carboxylic acid product  or acid portion of the ester product has one more carbon  atom than the olefin reacted.  in the case of the formation of  the ester, the second complexing component is an alcohol,  while in the case of the preparation of carboxylic acid, the  second complexing component is water.  the reaction pro­ duct may be dehydrogenated to a corresponding unsatu­ rated carboxylic acid or unsaturated carboxylic acid ester.

<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of acids and esters this invention relates to a method of preparing low molecular weight saturated carboxylic acids and esters thereof from lower olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, by carbonylation with carbon monoxide and a catalyst complex of bf3 and a second component. the second component is water where the end product is a carboxylic acid, and an alcohol where the end product is a carboxylic acid ester. these catalysts are stable complexes having specific physical properties. they exist as liquids at room temperature and therefore can be conveniently used as the reaction solvent. the active catalyst complex is formed by the addition of one mole of bf3 to one mole of the second component. the reaction takes place in the liquid catalyst solution through which gaseous carbon monoxide and the olefin are passed. the reaction conditions are moderate and a high yield of the acid or the ester, as the case may be, is obtained. the acid product or the carboxylic acid portion of the ester product has one more carbon atom than the initial olefin. substantially no polymerization of the olefin occurs. the saturated carboxylic - acid ester product may be readily dehydrogenated to form an unsaturated carboxylic acid ester, e . methyl isobutyrate obtained from the carbonylation of propylene may be dehydrogenated to form methyl methacrylate. alternatively, the propylene may be carbonylated to form isobutyric acid which may thereafter be dehydrogenated to methacrylic acid. a second embodiment of the invention relates to the recovery and recycle of the bf3 alcohol catalyst in a convenient and economical manner. in this embodiment, after the carbonylation the reaction mass consisting of the carboxylic acid ester, the alcohol, and the bf3 in a molar ratio of 1:1:2 is subjected to a distillation step wherein one-half of the bf3 is removed as a distillate fraction. the bottoms product from this step consists of the same components in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. this mixture is then further distilled after sufficient additional alcohol is added to form a low boilirig azeotrope with all of the carboxylic acid ester. this azeotrope is recovered as an overhead product. the residue material remaining is a bf3/alcohol 1:2 complex. this material may be easily reconstituted to form the 1:1 complex catalyst by the addition of free bf3, the latter of which may be that initially separated from the reaction mass. in the present invention, gaseous feedstocks consisting of either propylene or ethylene and carbon monoxide are used. the olefins may be obtained from any source, most generally from steam cracking of hydrocarbons. the carbon monoxide employed should have a purity of at least 99%, though mixtures of carbon monoxide and other inert gases, such as carbon dioxide, may be used. it is preferred that the olefin and carbon monoxide be of high purity since this will simplify product recovery and minimize losses in purge streams required to remove inerts from the reaction system. the reaction may be carried out at temperatures of from 0 c to
