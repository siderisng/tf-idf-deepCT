<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of water-insoluble enzyme preparations. According to the invention, inorganic carriers with different most common pore diameters are first provided according to methods known per se with functional groups capable of binding the enzyme and prepared from the thus-functional carriers according to methods known methods enzyme preparations by offering different amounts of enzyme of the different carriers . It turns out that the ABSO lute activity of the resulting preparations regardless of the enzyme quantity bound to them is dependent on the frequent pore diameter of the carrier and a maximum for a particular most common pore diameter passes through. Subsequently, enzyme preparations are prepared from the optimal carrier determined with respect to its most common pore diameter by offering different amounts of enzyme to this carrier. It turns out that in a certain enzyme offer, the specific activity of the specimen of the specific activity of the enzyme in free state is approaching or achieved. It can thus be used to optimize the enzyme amount required for a preparation with maximum activity. The invention also provides enzyme preparations with amyloglucosidase or glucose inomerase activity according to the method.
