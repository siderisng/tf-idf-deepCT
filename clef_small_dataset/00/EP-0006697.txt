<ABSTRACT>
an improved process is disclosed for forming polyme­ ric materials by a multistep, emulsion/suspension polyme­ rization procedure.  the improvement comprises using ho­ mogenization to disperse the monomeric reactants during  the initial emulsion polymerization portion or portions of  the multistep polymerization reaction so that the amount of  emulsifier that would be present for potential emulsifier-su­ spending agent interference during the later suspension  polymerization portion or portions of the process is redu­ ced.  this process yields a cleaner reaction.  a flow diagram  for a commercial scale process is shown in the drawing.

<DESCRIPTION>
title an improved process for forming emulsion/ suspension polymers and polymers so formed the present invention relates to an improvement in multistep emulsion/suspension polymerization techniques for forming polymeric materials. a variety of multistep polymerization procedures involving one or more initial emulsion and one or more later suspension polymerization steps are known. the use of the terminology "emulsion/suspension polymerization" in describing the present invention is intended to relate to this general type:of polymerization procedure. thus, in u.s. patent no. 3,657,172 to ruth e. gallagher et al., rubber-containing interpolymers are formed by suspension polymerizing from about 40% to about 99% by weight of the interpolymer, of vinyl monomer in the presence of a previously formed aqueous emulsion of particles comprising from about 0.5% to about 50%, by weight of the interpolymer, of a hard inner core of a polymer having a glass transition temperature (tg) above about 250c. and from about 0.5% to about 59%, by weight of the interpolymer, of an outer layer comprising a crosslinked rubber having a tg of less than about 250c. u.s. patent no. 3,832,318 to ruth e. gallagher et al. describes the formation of rubber-containing interpolymers which are prepared by suspension polymerizing from about 40% to about 98%, by weight of the interpolymer, of a vinyl monomer in the presence of from about 2% to about 60%, by weight of the interpolymer, of particles of a crosslinked acrylate rubber having a tg of less than about 250c. a more recent example of such multistep emulsion/suspension polymerization procedures is described in u.s. patent no. 3,944,631 to a. j. yu et a-l. which, in one embodiment, describes the suspension polymerization of from about 15% to about 90%, by weight of the interpolymer,of styrene and acrylonitrile in the presence of an aqueous latex of interpolymer particles comprising from about 5 to about 50%, by weight of the interpolymer,of a crosslinked (meth)acrylate component and from about 5% to about 35%, by weight of the interpolymer, of a crosslinked styrene-acrylonitrile component. in the above types of processes, an emulsifying agent is used in the initial emulsion polymerization step or steps to form a latex of polymer particles. this emulsion polymerization portion of the process is performed using conventional emulsion polymerization techniques. the latex, or the emulsion resin particles isolated therefrom, is then used as one of the ingredients during one or more later, conventional suspension polymerization procedures. the presence of residual emulsifying agent in either the latex, or the product isolated therefrom, however, has a tendency to interfere with the dispersing ability of the suspending agent used in the suspension polymerization step or steps. this often leads to a certain degree of polymer flocculation during the suspension polymerization step or steps which can be especially deleterious in plant scale polymerizations where the reaction mixture needs to be pumped through piping during commercial operations. the presence of polymer flocculation tends to interfere with such pumping operations. according to the present invention an improved multistep emulsion/suspension polymerization process is provided wherein homogenization is
