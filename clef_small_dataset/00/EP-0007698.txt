<ABSTRACT>
a two-stage system for enhancing the imaging unifor­ mity of a scintillation camera detects radiation events and  produces radiation count signals indicating the location and  energy level of individual detected radiation events.  the  uniformity correction system compensates for imprecision in  the camera's indication of both radiation event location and  energy level.  compensation for energy indication errors is  done by a first stage, prior to a second stage correction for  errors in event location indications.  the operations of both  stages are carried out in real time for each individual radiation  count, independently of the production of other counts.  the  first stage locates and stores the peak of detected energy  pulse height distribution for each of a plurality of regions in  the camera's field of view.  this regional profile of the cam­ era's energy response characteristic is used to synchronously  align a pulse height energy window of the camera imaging  circuitry with a series of pulse height distribution peaks  respectively corresponding to the regional locations of each  of a series of radiation counts.  the second uniformity correc­ tion stage, a flood correction circuit, produces and stores a  profile of the camera's regional variations in sensitivity in  response to uniform radiation flux over its field.  this stored  information is used for calculating sensitivity correction fac­ tors for several regions of the field.  the correction factors are  used for controlling the ratio of radiation counts correspond­ ing to each region which are actuallv imaged, thus effectively  equalizing camera sensitivity over its field.
