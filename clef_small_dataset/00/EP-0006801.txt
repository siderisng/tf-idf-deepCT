<ABSTRACT>
Nuclear Nuclear Nuclear Nuclear Covering Liquid Nutron Boiler comprises a vessel (4) which receives the core (24) of the reactor and the liquid metal, at least one value exchanger (6) between the liquid metal and a second fluid, a first pipe(28) which connects the tank to the entrance of the heat exchanger;the pipe opens into the tank above the core and a second pipe (30) connects the tank to the exit of the heat exchanger;The tank is provided at its periphery of first support means (12) at a given level;The first pipe is rectilinear and horizontal and opens in the tank above the first supporting means;the heat exchanger provided with second support means (40), the veal given;The second support means may put a displacement of the exchanger according to the direction of the first conduct.
