<ABSTRACT>
In hydraulic presses, a cutting tool (4a, 4b) supporting lifting piston (2) is driven by a compact cylinder working on both sides.To control the lifting piston movement, the press cylinder is equipped with a servo valve control.For attenuation of the so-called cutting pad during the passage of the tool through the workpiece, a damping device is provided.It has a dispenser (7) which scans the lifting piston adjustment path.The output of the guide is given as an actual size to an electrical control loop (6);As a setpoint, a signal corresponding to a predetermined continuous function is supplied to the control loop (6) during the cutting movement of the tool.This follows the tool of a predetermined way time function, and the passage through the workpiece takes place at a relatively low speed.
