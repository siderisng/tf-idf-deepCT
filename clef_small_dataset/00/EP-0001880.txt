<ABSTRACT>
polyester feed yarn for drawtexturing, having an elongation  at break of 30 to 150 percent, is composed of three  different types of filaments.  (a) 20 to 40 percent of the  filaments consist of a polymer of ethylene terephthalate and  0 to 3 mole percent of modifying groups for imparting  cationic dyeability.  (b) 20 to 40 percent of the filaments  consist of a copolymer of ethylene terephthalate and about 5  to 15 mole percent of other ester units.  (c) 15 to 35 weight  percent of the yarn consist of eccentric bicomponent filaments  of the above two polymers.  the bicomponent filaments  have a smaller denier and lower elongation at break  than the other filaments, so that the bicomponent filaments  can be broken preferentially when the yarn is drawtextured  to provide spun-like tactility.  when broken, the bicomponent  filaments helically crimp and become entangled in the yarn  bundle with a slight, uniform protrusion of ends above the  surface which provides good resistance to pilling in fabrics.
