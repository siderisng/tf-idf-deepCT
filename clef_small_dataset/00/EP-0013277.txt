<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a reversible unidirectional-flow  liquid pump.  the pump includes a pumping assembly comprising a  gerotor type of gear-set (46, 50), and has its inlet (66-68) in  series fluid-flow connection with a valve (70) adapted, upon  reversal of the direction of pump rotation, to cause a hydraulic  lock to be formed in the gear-set whereby the pumping  assembly is repositioned such as to ensure continued  unidirectional liquid flow despite the reversal of rotation.  the pump, which is particularly suitable for use as an oil  pump in refrigerant compressors, does not rely upon friction  in repositioning the pumping assembly.
