<ABSTRACT>
an endless power transmission belt (10) comprises a  plurality of v-belt components (11) spaced appart laterally  of the direction of extent of the belt and a tie band (12)  connecting the v-belt components (11) together to form a  unitary structure.  the tie band (12) is composed of a plu­ rality of cord fabric layers (13) disposed one on top of an­ other, each layer (13) comprising parallel cords (17) which  are embedded in an elastomeric material (15, 16) and  which are inclined with respect to the direction of extent  of the belt (10).  each adjacent pair of cord fabric layers  (13) have their cords mutually inclined at an angle between  95° and 155°, and also have a layer (14) of elastomeric  material interposed therebetween to prevent the cords in  said adjacent layers from rubbing against each other.  the  endless belt (10) has high stretchability both lengthwise  and widthwise thereof, permitting the tie band (12) to con­ form to the shape of the v-belt components (11) when the  latter locate in pulley grooves.
