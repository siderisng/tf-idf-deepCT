<ABSTRACT>
In integrated semiconductor assemblies with bipolar, inverse operated, vertical and / or lateral transistors, in particular with such transistors IÂ²l structures, an implantation of impurities occur, which takes place the conductivity type of an epitaxial layer (4) of a first guide type between base zone (40) of the second Conductive type and buried emitter zone (6) of the first line type of the vertical transistor compensates. The implantation is carried out by an insulating layer (12, 14) which contains the mask window for the collector zone (54). In this way, the course of the concentration maximum corresponds to the implanted zone (74) of the contour of the insulating layer (12, 14) and accordingly in the intrinsic base zone region is closer to the buried emitter zone (6) than in the extrinsic base zone region. The electric field built up by the resulting concentration gradient in the intrinsic base zone area increases the emitter power. In the extrinsic base zone area, the charge storage effect is simultaneously reduced. Implantation also expanded the collector zone (40) of a simultaneously manufactured, complementary lateral transistor so that their efficiency increases and also reduces the charge storage effect.
