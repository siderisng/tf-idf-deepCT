<ABSTRACT>
a charge coupled dcvice having an interface for the trans­ fer of charge packets between a multi-phase, multi-level paral­ lel register and serial register.  clock-phase distribution elec­ trodes (sø1, sø2) are disposed at the interface between the  serial register and the parallel register to isolate the interface  ends of the phase electrodes (16, 18) of the serial register from  the associated interface side of a parallel register electrode  (27).  thick oxide isolation regions (33) are positioned along  the parallel register to define parallel charge tansfer channels  (cl) and corresponding interface charge transfer channels b1)  that have substantially the same width as the parallel charge  transfer channels.  the interface charge transfer channels are  used to pass charge packets from the parallel charge transfer  channels of the parallel register to at least two corresponding  phases of the serial register.
