<ABSTRACT>
an oily water separator which has a plurality of parallel  corrigated plates (8,9) between which the oil/water mixture  is constrained to flow, adjacent plates being separated by  spacing forms (10) smoothly shaped to provide substantially  laminar flow therepast in a direction generally transverse to  the corrugations, each spacing form (10) being positioned  between two plates at a crest or at a trough in the corrugations  and having a leading edge (11) serving to divide the flow  therepast at said crest or trough, which edge extends generÂ­ ally tangentially to the said crest or trough of one of the  respective plates.
