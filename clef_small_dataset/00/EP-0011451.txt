<ABSTRACT>
an alarm system uses piezo electric crystals (2) which  when vibrated produce an electrical signal that can be amp­ lified and used to generate an alarm or perform some other  action.  each crystal and amplifier (3) are in a sensor unit (1)  with a latch circuit (7) and indicator (9).  vibrations latch the  indicator on, and the signal is also passed to a central control  unit (15).  this responds with an alarm or other action, relay  (25) controlled, and an energised indicator (24).  the control  unit also has a re-set facility (20) and an indicator (22) for  showing that the system is active.  if the cable connection  between any sensor unit and the control unit is cut, the effect  at the control unit is that of a disturbed sensor unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
security alarm systems this invention relates to security alarm st ¯ particularly concerned with perimeter pro@ec@ which is a system that gives a warning or initiates preventive or retaliatory action when any distu@bance oi the perimeter of the zone to be protected occurs. for example, external windows and doors of a building may fitted with sensors which1 when primed, respond to any shaking, vibration or other interference and send a si@@@ to a central alarm. the sensor in most general use for this type cf system is an inertia sensor. this usually takes the for of a metallic body resting in almost unstable equilibr@ on electrical contacts. any small disturbance lifts iz clear of at least one contact, thus @@@a@ing a it is virtually impossible to adjust their sensitivity, and they are very prone to giving false alarms as a result of quite harmless sources, such as heavy lorries and aircraft. also, the metallic body is subject to surface pitting, and this can produce an imperfect contact and a false alarm. it is also common practice to wire such sensors in series, and there is then no means of telling which alarm has set the system off. if it is a fault in the sensor, it can be extremely laborious and difficult to trace. the sensitivity of the whole circuit can be adjusted, but not each sensor individually. the adjustment requires an analyser, which is an expensive piece of equipment, and the sensitivity has to beset to an average. it is desirable to have each sensor with its own individual response to suit-its position. it is also desirable to have some means for recording or indicating which sensor is being or has been actuated. this is useful not only to find out where a break-in was attempted, but also to show if any particular sensor is faulty and too sensitive. it is the aim of this invention to provide an alarm system which answers some of these problems. according to the present invention there is provided a security alarm system comprising a piezo electric crystal responsive to stress to produce an electrical signal, amplifying means for such a signal, and means responsive to the amplified signal to qive an indication and/or perform a physical action when the crystal is vibrated. the combination of a crystal and amplifying circuit makes it very easy to provide sensitivity adjustment, which can be done by a simple potentiometer, for example, in the amplifying circuit. the crystal and its amplifier are small and easily housed in a compact container which can be inconsnicuously installed at almost any point where illegal entry is possible. convenientlv, the amplified signal is applied to a latch circuit which stays latched afte the disturbance has ceased. this latch circuit can be used to govern at least one indicating light emitting diode (lv he main response may be from a remote relay or other means for initiating an alarm or performing another security function. there can be a large number of

   * t    we claim is:  1. a security alarm system comprising a piezo electric crystal responsive to stress to produce an electrical signal, amplifying means for such a signal, and means responsive to the amplified signal to give an indication and/or perform a physical action when the crystal is vibrated.    2. a system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the amplified signal is applied to the responsive means via a latch circuit which stays latched after vibrations have ceased.    3. a system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the amplifier has associated sensitivity adjusting means whereby only vibrations of a selected magnitude and above can generate a signal to activate the responsive means.    4. a system as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the crystal and amplifying means are in a sensor unit remote from, and cable connected to, a control unit housing the responsive means.    5. a system as claimed in claims 2 and 4, wherein the sensor unit also contains the latch circuit and an indicator governed thereby to show if vibrations have occurred.    6. a system as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the control unit has an indicator to show whether the system is active.    7. a system as claimed in claim   i 5 or 6,wherein at    least  part of the responsive means is an indicator on the control unit.    8. a system as claimed in claim 7, wherein means are provided for neutralising another part of the responsive means, after activation, without   affect    ing the indicator part.     9. a system as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 8, wherein the control unit has reset means by which    > -e    system can be restored to its active, pre-vibrated state.    10. a system as claimed in any one of claims 4 to   ,    wherein the control unit and the cable connection are such that if the latter is cut or otherwise removed while the system is active there is a response from said responsive means.    11. a system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein there is a plurality of crystals and associated amplifying means connected in parallel to common said responsive means.    12. a security alarm system substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawing.
