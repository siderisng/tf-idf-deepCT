<ABSTRACT>
a process and an apparatus for fractionating gas mixtures  by adsorbing a first gas from a mixture thereof with a  second gas, to reduce the concentration of the first gas in the  mixture to below a desired maximum concentration, in  which the adsorption cycle is timed according to the rate of  fill through an orifice of a space of predetermined volume by  withdrawing a portion of effluent gas, feeding such effluent  gas portion into a space of predetermined volume through  an adjustable orifice, accumulating the withdrawn effluent  gas in the space, and discontinuing the adsorption cycle  when the volume and/or pressure of accumulated effluent  gas in the space reaches or exceeds a predetermined  minimum, thereby making it possible to control the cycling  independently of any external control or power source.
