<ABSTRACT>
The two-stage exhaust gas turbocharger unit has a low-pressure turbole (1) and a high-pressure turbine (2). Each of the turbocharger (1,2) is provided with a driven by a turbine (1 ', 2'), on each separate shaft (3,4) arranged compressor (1 ", 2"). To provide space for additional components such as charge air coolers (5,10) bypass assembly (7), etc., thereby enabling a compact assembly, the pressure relates to the low pressure compressor (1 ") is selected by at least 40% larger than the pressure ratio of high pressure - compressor (2 "), so that the geometric outer abbrees of the high-pressure turbine (2) is significantly smaller who sets the laterally parallel to the shaft (4) as those of the low-pressure turbole (2) and the shaft (3) of the high-pressure turbole (2) and the shaft (3) of the high-pressure turbole (2) of the low-pressure turbole (1) arranged. As a result of the small high-pressure turbine (2), it is possible to arrange at least a portion of the additional components (7.9) in the radial rectification in addition to this without exceeding the wrapping profile (12) of the low-pressure turbine (1), so that a very compact exhaust gas turbocharger generating aggregate.
