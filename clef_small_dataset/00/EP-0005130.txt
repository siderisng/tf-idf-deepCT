<ABSTRACT>
an arrangement for the processing of a moving material  web, in particular for the creasing or punching of an extruded  material web made of plastics.  in the manufacture of such  material webs a number of operational steps take place  directly in conjunction with the manufacture of the web itself,  and the fact that for reasons of quality as well as of  manufacturing technique the extrusion process cannot be  interrupted makes it necessary to attend to any changes in  the crease pattern etc.  during operation.  the arrangement in  accordance with the invention makes this possible, in that  the material web can be brought into contact optionally with  different pairs of processing rollers with the help of a pair of  counter-rollers supported in a swivelling cradle, any pair of  unused rollers being freely exchangeable against a pair of  rollers with a different creasing pattern.  the arrangement  permits the processing of both sides of the web and the rapid  exchange of different processing patterns during continuing  production, which is particularly advantageous in the processing  of material webs for the manufacture of packing  containers.
