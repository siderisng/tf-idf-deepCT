<ABSTRACT>
an electronic balance having highly improved accuracy of  the measurement obtained by reducing the errors due to the  scatter of data, which is an inevitable problem of the prior art in  which the measurements have been made by calculating the  simple average value of the sampled data during a predeter­ mined period of time to avoid the interfering influences due to  vibrations of the object being measured as such or caused by  installing locations or windiness.  in the electronic balance of  this invention, the values of data sampled during a predeter­ mined period of time are stored and at the same time the latest  sampled values is compared in order with the previously  stored values.  when the value of difference obtained by the  comparison is within a predetermined acceptable allowance,  calculations are made for all the stored values to derive an av­ erage value.  if the difference is beyond the allowance, the  stored data are erased and the operations of sampling and  comparison are repeated until the scatter of all the sampled  values may come within the limit allowed.  since the electronic  balance of this invention is capable of measurement with high  accuracy even under the vibrative cirumstances, it may be ef­ fectively used for body-weight measurement of laboratory ani­ mals or various kinds of control system in factories, and further  is applicable to measurement systems which are equipped on  moving carrier means such as cars, ships and the like.
