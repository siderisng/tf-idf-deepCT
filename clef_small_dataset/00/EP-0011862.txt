<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for monitoring the surface temperature of a  heated roller comprising a ferromagnetic material with a  curie point in a selected temperature range inserted in the  surface of the roller and an ac bridge circuit having said  material included by non-contact coupling in one arm of said  bridge.  the bridge circuit responds to changes in the permea­ bility of said material over a narrow range of temperatures  centred at a given temperature to provide a control signal for  controlling the temperature of the roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
non-contact temperature sensor for a fusing roller this invention relates, in general, to heated fusing roller apparatus for affixing toner material to a substrate to form permanent images thereon and, more particularly, to means for sensing changes in temperature of the heated roller very closely in order to develop control signals for maintaining substantially constant the surface temperature of the heated roller at an area where it contacts the toner material. in the process of electrostatic or magnetic printing, information is typically recorded in the form of a latent electrostatic or magnetic image on a recording member with subsequent rendering of the latent image visible by the application of electrostatic and/or magnetic marking particles, commonly referred to as toner. the visual image can be either fixed directly upon the recording member or transferred from the member to a sheet of plain paper with subsequent affixing of the image thereto. in order to permanently affix or fuse a toner material onto a record medium, such as paper, it is necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the constituents of the toner material coalesce and become adhesive. this action causes the toner to be absorbed to some extent into the fibers of the record medium. pressure is sometimes used to increase the adhesion. thereafter, a the toner material is cooled, soliifiction of the toner material occurs causing the toner material to be firrrly bonded to twe record meelzm. in both the electrostatic and magnetic printing arts, the use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is old and well-known. one approach to thermal fusing of toner images onto a record medium has been to pass the record medium with the toner images thereon between a pair of opposed rollers, at least one of which is either externally or internally heated. in thi5 type of arrangement, the toner image contacts the surface of the heated roller member in the nip between rollers to thereby produce heating of the toner image within the nip. in apparatus utilizing a fuser roll pair as described above, it is important that the heated roller surface be maintained within a suitable range to properly fuse the toner image to its record medium. a conventional manner for accomplishing the foregoing is by the employment of a temperature sensitive resistance device commonly referred to as a thermistor which is placed in physical contact with the heated roll and whose output controls the heat source. an improved arrangement for controlling the heat source is described in a copending u.s. patent application entitled "temperature controller for a fusing roller" serial no. 965,880 filed december 4, 1978 and assigned to ffi zomón assignee. there is wear to thermistor and fuser roller surface at the contact point. slidiny contact produces fri-zionai temperature rise which is dependent upon condition cf sliding interface (amount of non-stick oil applied, contamination of interface with toner material, age and condition of roller surface, etc.). snce this temperature rise
