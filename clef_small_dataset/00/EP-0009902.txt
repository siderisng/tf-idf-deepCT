<ABSTRACT>
a flywheel (1) for storing rotational energy at high  energy densities possesses a primary failure mode of  delamination.  the flywheel is constructed from glassy  metal alloy strips (3) having a high specific strength com­ parable to anisotropic fibers used in high energy density  flywheels and, in addition, having isotropic or non-­ directional strength properties allowing a fuller utilization  of the strength of the material and thereby increasing  energy storage capacities.  the glassy metal alloy strips are  formed into circular layers (2), and a plurality of layers are  joined concentrically to build up the flywheel.  joining bet­ ween strips (3) and layers (2) is accomplished with bond­ ing means such that a substantially mechanically mono­ lithic composite structure results, by providing a bonding  shear strength at least equal to the specific strength times  the density divided by the aspect ratio of the glassy metal  alloy strips (3).
