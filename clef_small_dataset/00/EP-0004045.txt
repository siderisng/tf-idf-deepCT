<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a power shift transmission (10) having two  input shafts (13, 26), an output shaft (20), two countershafts  (40, 72) which are first synchronized and clutched with either  of the input shafts (13, 26), and then alternately clutched to  the output shaft (20).  each countershaft (40, 72) rotatably  supports a ratio gear (44, 76) driven by one of the inputs shafts  (26), a ratio gear (46, 78) driven by the other output shaft (13)  and a drive gear (68, 104) for driving the output shaft (20).  a  reverse gear (80) is rotatably supported by one of the countershafts  (72).  a double acting synchronizer (42, 74) is disposed  between the two ratio gears (44, 46, 76, 78) on each  countershaft (40, 72) for synchronizing and clutching either  of the ratio gears (44, 46, 76, 78) to the countershaft (40, 72).   a hydraulically actuated friction clutch (48, 82) is disposed  adjacent the drive gear (68, 104) on each countershaft (40, 72)  for clutching the countershaft (40, 72) to the driven gear (70,  106).  one of the input shafts (26) is a torque converter (16)  driven shaft; this shaft (26) drives the ratio gears (50, 86, 44, 76)  which are first and second speeds and the reverse gear  (108).  the other input shaft (13) is a torque converter bypass  shaft; this shaft (13) drives the ratio gears (52, 46, 78) which  are third and fourth speeds.  the transmission (10) utilizes  helical gears and the helical angle direction of the ratio (44,  46, 76, 78) and drive (68, 104) gears on the countershafts (40,  72) are such that axial forces on the contact teeth of the gears  impart bending stresses on the countershaft (40, 72) which  subtract from bending stresses on the shaft caused by radial  forces on the contacting teeth of the gears.
