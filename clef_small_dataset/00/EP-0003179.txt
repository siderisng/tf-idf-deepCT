<ABSTRACT>
a hydraulically operated fuel injector for compression-ignition  engines which includes an electronically or pneumatically  operated hydraulic pilot-control valve (30) which is  supplied with fuel under substantially constant pressure  from a pump driven directly or indirectly by the engine.  the  pilot-control valve (30) is connected by supply and exhaust  passages to a slave valve which in turn controls the  admission of fuel to a charging cavity (86) located adjacent to  an outlet valve (98) to the combustion chamber.  the slave  valve is a stepped diameter piston (72 and 82) which  functions as a pressure amplifier for the fuel supply to the  combustion chamber.  fuel from the pump which is received  at relatively low pressure through the slave valve is amplified  to high pressures sufficient to overcome compression and  combustion pressures of the engine and the resistance of  spring seated injector outlets and/or the fuel supply orifice(s).
