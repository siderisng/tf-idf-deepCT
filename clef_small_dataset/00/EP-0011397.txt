<ABSTRACT>
a feeder (25) for livestock and the like is disclosed.  the  feeder has a feed receiver body (31) for receiving and storing  a flow of feed from a conveyor.  as shown in figs.  2, 3 and 4,  a drop tube means (51) extends from the feed conveyor into  the feed receiver body (31), and includes at least one wall  (65) mounted for vertical motion relative to a fixed wall  (55,57).  when the movable wall is in a raised position, that  movable wall (65) and the fixed wall (55,57) define a verti­ cally oriented opening (64) through which feed can pass  from the drop tube (51) into the receiver body (31).  by adjust­ ing the position of the movable wall (65), the amount of feed  collected in the receiver (25) can be correspondingly  changed.  when a stopper valve member (40) is drawn away  from a discharge opening (44), the feed pile collected in the  receiver body (31) is discharged from the receiver (25) for  livestock consumption.  a stopper actuator (47) includes a  flexible member (49) connected to the stopper valve (40), and  a rotatable wind-up device (48) connected to the flexible  member (49).  when the wind-up device (48) is rotated, the  flexible member (49) is wound up and draws the stopper  valve (40) away from the discharge opening (44).
