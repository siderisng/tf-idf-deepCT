<ABSTRACT>
a transducer, e. g.  a stepping motor, for an electronic  timepiece comprises a permanently magnetised rotor (1) having  at least two poles (n,s); a stator (2, 3) having an internal  surface (20) radially inwardly of which the rotor (1) is disposed  and from which it is spaced, the stator (2, 3) being made of an  highly permeable magnetic material and being magnetically  coupled to the rotor (1); and a coil (4) magnetically coupled to  the stator (2, 3).  in order to reduce power consumption it is arranged that   0. 6 > rr/sr > 0. 3, and 1. 5 > rt/st â‰§ 0. 8   where rr is the maximum distance of any point on the external  surface of the rotor (1) from the axis (21) of the rotor (1), sr  is the minimum distance of any point on the internal surface  (20) of the stator (2, 3) from the axis (21) of the rotor (1), and rt  and st are the axial thicknesses of the rotor (1) and stator (2, 3)  respectively.
