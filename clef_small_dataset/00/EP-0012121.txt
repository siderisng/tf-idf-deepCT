<ABSTRACT>
a removable goose-neck connector (12) for a roll-trailer is  formed as a z-shaped member having an arm (17) for introduction  into a corresponding pocket (14) in the trailer.  the arm  is provided with a displaceable latching member (20), which  may be brought to cooperate with a recess (22) formed within  the pocket.  the latching member is preferably remotely controlled  from the towing vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
a g()ose-\.e(h' connector for a roll-trailer a certain type of roll-trailers is provides with a so called goo.e-neck connector adapted to be hitched to a vehicle when the trailer is to be moved the connector will project forward of the platform of tulle trailer, and is a hinderance when the trailer is parked, either it is empty or is loaded. on man occasions the connector has there- fore been designed as a disconnectable member, which normally is mounted upon the vehicle and is provided with an arm, which during transportation is retained in a pocket at the trailer. the arm is usually, at its distal end, provided with a downwardly directed projection, which engages a recess in bottom wall of the pocket. the arm will mainly be kept in place due to friction, when the connector is lifted upwards by the vehicle. when the carriage set runs over un-even ground, moverients in the vertical direction may occur, which tend to loosen the frictional engagement between the arrii and the pocket, different latching devices@at the distal end of the arm have been proposed but have often contained brackets protruding from the forward end of the trailer, and are usually so designed, that the driver rust leave his seat in order to perform the final connection the aim of the present invention is to propose a disconnectable connector device, which on tho on hand is designed so it does not obstruet the introduetion of the arm into the pocket, and in the second hand dans@ net require any elements at the trailer, projecting from the forward end thereof. a further aim of the invention is to design the device in such a manner, that it may be remotely controlled t'roiii the tli i cle. a connector according to the invent ion i characterlzed in a latching member fitted within the connector an and being shiftable between two positions tor cooperation with a recess within the pocket. the latching member is preferably connected to a pressure fluid ran provided we thin the connector and arranged for remote control from the vehicle to which the connector is hitched. one embodiment of the invention will below be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which figure 1 schematically shows a roll-trailer carriage, figure 2 shows a detail of the goose-neck connector and the connection pocket, figure 3 shows the connector, as viewed from above, and cut open along line ill-ill in figure 2, and figure 4 shows a modified embodiment of the latching member. the roll-trailer carriage showy in figure 1 includes a towing vehicle 10 and a trailer 11, which by means of a goose-neck connector 12 is hitched to the vehicle. the trailer is supported by wheels 13 at its end remote from connector. the forward end of the trailer must be carried by a vehicle during transportation. the goose-neck connector 12 is, however, not permanently connected to the trailer, but is connectable at a pocket 14 in the front part thereof.
