<ABSTRACT>
pharmaceutical composition, useful for the treatment of  hypercholesteremia in mammals, especially humans, comprising  (a) a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor acting at the  hmg-coa reductase level with an eo₅₀ less than 10⁻⁶, such as  a 6-[2-(8-substituted-2-methyl-1,2,6,7,8,8a  -hexahydro-1-naphthyl) ethyl]-4-hydroxy-4, 5-  dihydro-2-pyrone or a 4r trans-6-phenyl-e-4-  hydroxytetrahydropyran-2-one in which e is a bond, a c₁₋₃  alkylene or-ch=ch-and (b) a non-toxic anion exchange resin  in the weight ratio of 1:0. 08 to 1:15,000.  the resin preferably is  a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer containing quaternary  ammonium groups.  when present in the indicated weight  ratios, synergism exists between the cholesterol synthesis  innibitor and the anion exchange resin.  the components can  be present separately for separate dosages or, preferably, as a  unitary combination.  the effects of treatments with compound  ii (compactin) and with cholestyramine, separately  and in combination, are illustrated by figure 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
title of tae invention pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment of hypercholesteremia background of the invention it has long been known that certain diseases, such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, may be caused by the presence of too high a cholesterol level in the blood plasma and there have been many attempts to provide a medicament formulation for oral administration to reduce this cholesterol level. a number of pharmacological mechanisms have beenpostulated as usable to reduce cholesterol in the body. the binding of cholesterol itself into a non-depositable form by e.g. phytosterols has been tried. certain phenoxyalkanoic acids-e.g. chlorphenoxy-isobutyric acid (cpib) and its esters1 or halofenate- reduce the high density lipoproteins in which cholesterol is bound in rats and thus reduce blood cholesterol in that. species, but are not particularly effective in humans who have the cholesterol associated with low density lipoproteins. attempts have also been made to block the synthesis of cholesterol. the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis is known to the action of the enzyme 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase (hereinafter hmg-coa reductase) a number of compounds have been reported to inhibit this enzyme but their activity for the most par have been too weak to show much effect. recently, endo et al., antibiotics, 1346-48, 29 (1976), have reported that 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8a-hexahåaro-7- methyl-8-[2-(3,4,5,6-tetrhydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2h-pyran-2-yl]ethyl)-l-naphthy 2-methyl butanoate, (known as ml 2363), reduced serum cholesterol levels in the acutely treated rat. the same group of workers have shown, eur. j. bio chem. 77 (1977), that this compound is a very potent inhibitor of the reductase enzyme. in fact, the ed50 in the inhibition test has been found to be of the order of 1018 this was the first inhibitor of such potency to be reported. however, bensch et al., biochemical and biophysical research communications, 247-254, 82 (1978) report that they had found no effect on serum sterol levels compared with fed or fasted controls. furthermore, bensch et al., observed no change in either liver or liver microsomal cholesterol concentration. bensch et al., demonstrated a marked increase in hmg-coa reductase, as observed in fed rats three hours following the administratio of ml-236b. the increased hmg-coa reductase activity found in rats and fibroblasts treated with 1,2,3,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-8-[2-(3,4,5,6-tetrhydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2h-pyran-2 yllethayll-l-naphthyi 2-methyl butanoate suggests that the production of hmg-coa reductase may be induced and, therefore, produces an increase in enzyme protein synthesis. the induction of this enzyme indicates that as the number of active molecules of hmg-coa reductase was reduced by the competitive inhibitor, 1,2,3,7,8 ,8a-hexahydro-7-methyl-s- [2-(3,4,5,6-tetrhydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2h-pyran-2-yl]ethyl)l-naphthyl 2-methyl butanoate, the cell responds by increased synthesis of the enzyme protein in order to maintain a basic rate of sterol biosynthesis. more recently, monaghan et al., have described the isolation from fermentation related compounds, e.g. msd 803, described below, which are even more potent inhibitors of the enzyme and willard et al., have described related synthetic compounds which also are potent inhibitors of the enzyme. these, together with the endo et al*, compounds form a unique class of hg-coa reductase inhibitors with ed50 of
