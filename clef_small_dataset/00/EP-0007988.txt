<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for tipping out heat treatment material, which is contained in a charge container (9) and treated in a heat treatment furnace, into a quenching bath, with a device (6) for tilting the charge container (9), characterized in that the tilting device comprises a tilting table (1) which is rotatably mounted on the furnace walls (5, 5') via lateral supports (2) and support bearings (3) and a drive journal (4) respectively ; in that the drive journal (4) is connected to a rotating device (6) which is diposed outside the furnace ; in that on the tilting table (1) there are provided lateral guide rails (7) for the container which extend parallel to the charging direction of the container (9) and between which a number of rollers (8) are mounted forming the surface on which the charge container (9) ist displaced ; in that on the guide rails (7) cams (10) are provided laterally on the inside which engage in corresponding grooves (11) of the charge container (9) and retain the charge container (9) in the tilted state ; and in that a catch (12) is provided which engages in the base of the charge container (9) as soon as the tilting table (1) leaves its normal position.
