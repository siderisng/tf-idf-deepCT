<ABSTRACT>
apparatus including a flexible, elongated chamber (70)  having an open submerged front for receiving water and oil  thereinto during relative movement between the chamber  and the body of water, at least one cable (61) for folding the  chamber, said cable being slidably connected to one extrem­ ity of the chamber (62, 63) and fixedly connected to the other  extremity of the chamber (64), and two inclinable ramps (103)  for launching and retrieving the chamber with a vessel (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
ataraimus for oving gil frown r± surface of a body of waver the present invention relates to apparatus for removing oil from the surface of a body of water and more particularly relates to an oil spill clean-up kit that can convert many kinds of vessels into temporary skimmers in a relatively short time. it permits more rapid response to oil spills which occur in remote areas. such kits are storable on drilling platforms, for example, and if a spill occurs in the vicinity, work boats may be transformed into skimmers that immediately begin cleaning up the spill. an apparatus cf the above type is subject to our netherlands application no. 7711932. object of the present invention is to provide, for use in an apparatus for removing oil from the surface of a body of water, a foldable sock skimmer and means for deploying such a skimmer, and launching and retrieving such a skimmer with a vessel, boat or platform as indicated above. in one embodiment of the present invention, means is proviaed for folding or deploying this or similar skimmers principally characterized by an at least partislly flexible, elongated chamber having an open, at least partially submerged front for receiving water and oil thereinto during relative movement between the chamber and the body of water. in particular, the folding or deploying means is at least one cable which is slidably connected to at least one extremity of the chamber and fixedly connected to the other extremity of the chamber. one or more slidable connections intermediate the connections at the extremities of the chamber, facilitate folding the chamber "accordian-style. in another separate embodiment of the present invention, means is provided for launching and/or retrieving this or similar skimmers principally characterized by an at least partially flexible, elongated chamber having an open, at least partially submerged front for receiving water and oil thereinto during relative movement between the chamber and the body of water; and at least two inclinable ramps for launching and retrieving the chamber with a vessel. dreferably, each of the two inclinable ramps is composed of at least two segments united by a joint, one of the segments being in an elevated position to "cradle" the skimmer when the skimmer is being transported and in a lowered position when the skimmer is being launched or retrieved. the invention will now further be described with reference to the accompanying drawing, showing by way of example preferent embodiments of the present invention. figure 1 is a view of a skimmer and towing vessel in operation. figures 2 and 3 show a comparison of the prior art with the present invention. figure 4 is a view of the rotatable bumper of the present invention. figures 5a, sb and 5c show a foldable skimmer and in particular folding sequence for larger skimmers. figures 6a, 6b and 6c show a folding sequence for smlll foldable skimmers. figures 7 and 8 are plan views of alternate cable lay-outs. figures 9 and 10 are frame
