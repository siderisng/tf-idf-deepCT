<ABSTRACT>
in an encapsulated electrical switch panel, it is intended that the heat from the current is to be dissipated by simple means and, at the same time, the ingress of dust and atmospheric humidity is to be prevented.  this is achieved in that means for perturbing the air inside the switch panel are provided.  this air is fed in a closed circuit along the inner sides of the metallic housing surface of the switch panel and emits the heat produced by the current to the exterior via the housing.  if the switch panel has partitioned chambers (1, 2, 3) it is particularly advantageous to arrange internal chamber blocks (19) in the air circuit in the locality of the partition chamber walls.  <image>
