<ABSTRACT>
a wiring distribution system for fill-on-slab or fill-on-grade  floor constructions, including an uninterrupted main  unit providing main passageways and at least one laterally  extending feeder unit providing feeder passageways supported  on a substructure (-slab or -grade).  a housing  having a removable cover encloses a full-width segment of  the main unit and an end segment of the feeder unit.  a  covering layer of concrete (fill-) surrounds the housing.  a  partition divides the interior of the enclosure into two  compartments, a first communicating with one feeder passageway  and a second communicating with the other feeder  passageways.  the main unit presents at least one common  lengthwise trough extending through and beyond the  opposite sides of the enclosure.  first and second capping  means enclose those portions of the common lengthwise  trough on opposite sides of the enclosure to provide substantially  unobstructed additional main passageways communicating  with the second compartment.  isolator means  within the housing isolates the first compartment from the  common lengthwise trough.  the arrangement is such that  high voltage wiring extending through a designated main  passageway may be fed through the first compartment to a  corresponding feeder passageway whereas low voltage  wiring, such as telephone and signal wiring, extending  through others of the main passageways may be fed  through the second compartment to corresponding feeder  passageways.
