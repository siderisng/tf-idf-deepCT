<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a control apparatus for a recording/playback  system using an endless recording medium which has a  recording medium (10) having a position detecting mark (12)  attached to a fixed position thereof and driven at a given  speed (v), mark detecting means (26,28) for detecting the  position detecting mark (12) as the recording medium (10) is  driven, whereby a mark position signal (e1) to indicate the  fixed position is provided, and a control means (100) for con­ trolling in accordance with the mark position signal (e1)  recording or playback operation with the recording medium  (10).  the control means (100) includes first means (32 to 50)  for providing a first signal (e9) corresponding to data to indi­ cate the one-cycle length of the recording medium (10) by  means of measuring a pulse interval of the mark position  signal (e1) and storing the data, and second means (44, 52 to  56) for providing in response to the first signal (e9) an output  signal (e10) to give a timing for controlling the recording or  playback operation with the recording medium (10).
