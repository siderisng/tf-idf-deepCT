<ABSTRACT>
a bipolar charge-coupled two-channel semi-torbuilder element consisting of a substrate (9) overlying as a n-zone, an overlying p-zone (10) and a diluted in the region of the gates diluted thereto-mounted dielectric layer (11) with overlying Gate electrodes (G1, G2.,,) In addition to associated connection metallizations, for storing a first, from minority loading packets, the bit sequence has a first line channel in the surface area and a second bit sequence in the depth area of ​​the P-zone, a second for storing a second of majority load carrier packets in the depth region of the P zone (10). The two bit sequences can be moved along the surface or along the depth channel simultaneously and independently, so that thanks to the above other shift registers, a substantially increased storage density of the relevant semi-terchip is obtained compared to so far.
