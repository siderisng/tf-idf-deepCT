<ABSTRACT>
cyclic and linear acetals and ketals of fatty aliphatic alde­ hydes and ketones have been found to have valuable emolli­ ent properties.  especially preferred compounds are those  form mixed c₁₃/₁₅-aldehydes and lower alkylene glycols, gly­ cerols and substituted glycerols, alcohols and tetritols.  the  acetals and ketals may be prepared by direct reaction be­ tween the aldehyde or ketone and the hydroxy compound or  by acetal or ketal interchange, i. e.  reaction between a lower  alkyl acetal or ketal and the alcohol or polyol.  the emollients  find use in a wide variety of cosmetic, toilet and household  cleaning compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
title acetals and ketals, their preparation and use as emollients slis invention relates to certain acetals and ketals which have emollient properties and to compositions containing such acetals or ketals. according to the present invention there is provided an emollient comprising an acetal or a ketal of a fatty aliphatic aldehyde or ketone having a total of from 7 to 30 carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain or chains, and more especially from 13 to 30 carbon atoms. the acetal or ketal may be cyclic or linear, that is it may be derived from an alcohol, r3 oh, or a polyol containing at least two or groups, r4(oh)2, in which and r4 have the meanings hereinafter defined. cyclic acetals and ketals, containing 5-membered (1 ,3-dioxolane) and 6-membered (1 ,3-dioxane) rings and having the general formula: emi2.1 wherein r1 is a fatty aliphatic chain and r2 is h or a fatty aliphatic chain, provided the sum of the carbon atoms in r1 and r2 together is from 13 to 30, and r4 is an alkylene chain which is optionally substituted with for example hydroxy, alkoxy, acyloxy or polyalkyleneoxy groups, have been found to have particularly valuable emollient properties. the aliphatic chains, such as r1 or r2, preferably contain from 8 to 20 carbon atoms and examples include alkyl groups containing 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 carbon atoms which groups may be straight chain or branched. an especially preferred species of r1, when r2 is h, comprises a mixture of c12 and c14 alkyl groups. it is further preferred that each of these c12 and c14 alkyl groups comprises a mixture of straight and branched chains, particularly a-branched chains. suitable aldehydes for use in preparing acetals according to the present invention are conveniently prepared from olefines, especially a-olefins, by the oxo-process, i.e. hydrocarbonylation of the double bonded carbon atoms. an especially preferred oxo-aldehyde, prepared from mixed c12 and c14 a-olefines, comprises a 70:30 mixture of c12 and c14 alkyl chains approximately 50% of which are straight and 50% are branched. a specific class of cyclic acetals or ketals, especially the former, having valuable emollient properties, is the class derived from a fatty aliphatic aldehyde or ketone and a lower alkylene glycol, such as ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1h2-propanediol and 2 ,2-dimethyl-1 ,3-propanediol. especially preferred emollients of this class have the following structures: emi3.1 wherein r1 is the fatty aliphatic chain of the aldehyde as hereinbefore defined and particularly the oxoaldehyde derived from the mixed c12 and c14 o-olefine. throughout this specification the terms lower alkyl and lower alkylene refer to groups containing up to 5 carbon atoms. the above class of cyclic acetal or ketal is made by reacting the appropriate aldehyde or ketones or mixed aldehydes or ketones with the appropriate diol, preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst, or may alternatively be made by what may be described as an acetal- or ketal-interchange reaction using the diol and for example the di(lower alkyl), for example dimethyl, acetal
