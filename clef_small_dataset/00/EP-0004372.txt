<ABSTRACT>
the disclosed process for making cast vegetable/  mineral structural products having flame retardant properties  utilise a major volume portion of ligneus plant fragments  such as soft- and hardwoods, sugarcane, cereal and  fiber plant stalks, and a minor volume proportion of a mineral  binder deposit comprised of magnesium or calcium  oxyphosphates and inert filler particles.  fragments having  thicknesses ranging from 0. 3 mm to 8 mm including chips,  shavings, strips, strands, fibre bundles, slivers, fibres and  peeled and sawn veneer sheets, have applied to their surfaces  an aqueous solution of ammonium polyphosphate  or soluble acid phosphate salt supplying from 0. 15 to 0. 40  parts of p₂o₅ as phosphate ion per part of fragments by  weight, and particulate cement solids comprised of mgo  or cao or mg(oh)₂ or ca(oh)₂ or mgco₃ or caco₃ ranging  from 0. 25 to 1. 0 part per part of fragment, and from 0. 01 to  0. 80 parts of inert filler particles and the mixture is molded  and held under predetermined compaction pressure until  the product has rigidified, in about 10 minutes time.  greater flame retardation results when the phosphate  solution is mainly absorbed into the fragment surfaces  before the cement solids are dusted onto the wet surfaces.   at low compaction pressures the product has low bulk density  and an open structure.  use og mgo of density 2. 8 or  higher of -100 to +250 mesh size and ammonium polyphosphates  of analysis 10:34:00 or 11:37:00 with air-dry  or oven-dry fragments in amount sufficient to retain on  drying impregnated salt loads up to 65 milligrams per cc  of ligneus material obtains strong, highly fire-retardant  product.  products molded by the processes according to the  invention may comprise any of the common structural  shapes such as boards, panels, slabs, beams and blocks,  and may comprise frames, trusses, poles, tubes, and virtually  any castable configurations.  such products may be  made economically with little or even no mixing in a wide  range of product bulk densities according to the degree  of compaction maintained during setting, and require very  short molding and curing times.  such products after curing  are flame resistant, rot resistant, weather resistant, and  are not attacked by termites.
