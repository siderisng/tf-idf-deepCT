<ABSTRACT>
electrically photosensitive particles for electrophoretic  migration imaging processes.  electrically photosensitive particles (4) for use in electrophoretic  migration imaging processes comprise a compound  having the structure:    wherein m and n are zero, one or two; r¹ and r² each represents  hydrogen, alkyl or aryl; y represents o or s; l¹ through l⁵  represent hydrogen, alkyl or aryl, or in addition, either l¹ and  l² or any two of l³, l⁴ and l⁵ together represent the atoms  needed to complete a carbocyclic ring; a¹ represents a basic  heterocyclic nucleus and a² represents the a¹ nuclei, an aryl  group or a heterocyclic nucleus.  the particles (4) can be used in an electrophoretic migration  imaging process which consists in placing them between  two electrodes (1) and (5) and submitting them to an activating  radiation and an electric field for obtaining an image on  electrodes (1) and (5).
