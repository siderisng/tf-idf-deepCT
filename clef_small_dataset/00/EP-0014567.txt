<DESCRIPTION>
processes for preparation of ss-lactam compounds an intensive research effort in the field of cephalosporin antibiotics has produced a number of clinically significant cephalosporin compounds. one of the more recent developments in this area has been the discovery of cephem compounds directly substituted with halogen at the c-3 position. a number of 3-halo- 3-cephems have been described by chauvette ln u.s. patents nos. 3,925,372, 4,064,343 and 3,962,227. these potent antibiotic compounds are prepared by helogenation of the corresponding 3-hydroxy-3-cephems. the halo- genation of 3-hydroxy-3-cephems to provide 3-chlcro and 3-bromo-3-cephems has typically been carried out by reacting the 3-hydroxy-3-cephem compounds with brominating or chlorinating agents including phosgene, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide and phosphorous halides such as phosphorous trichloriae and phosphorus tribromide, usually in the presence of dimethylformamide. also, in the preparation of semi-synthetic penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics most chemical modifications are preformed on r-lactam substrates bearing 0-6 or c-7 acylamino groups which are stable te the process conditions but are not preferred for maximum antibiotic activity. thus, a process step common to the production of most if not all of the known clinically significant penicillins and cephalosporins is te cleavage of the c-6 or c-7 acylamlno group to provide the corresponding c-5 or c-7 amine compounds which are reacylated as desired. undoubtedly the most widely used method for cleaving penicillin and cephalosporin acylamino side chains is that wherein the c-6 or c-7 acylamino compound is first converted to the corresponding imino halide and then to an imino ether which, upon acidic hydrolysis or alcoholysis, provides the nucleus (c-6 or c-7 amino) compounds. this general method and improvements thereof have been described in a number of u.s. patents including nos. 3,549,628, 3,575,970, 3,697,515, 3,845,043 and 3,868,368. a number of acid halides, especially, acid chlorides, derived from phosphorous, carbon and sulfur or their oxygen acids have been disclosed as useful for preparing the imino halide intermediates of the threestep amido cleavage process. phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous trichloride, thidnyl chloride, phosgene, oxalyl chloride and catechylphosphorous trichloride have, in particular, been described as suitable imino halide forming reagents. laboratory experience has shown phosphorus pentachloride to be a preferred acid halide reagent for intermediate imino halide preparation. cephalosporin sulfoxides are.also widely used intermediates in the synthesis of cephalosporin antibiotics. following the completion of the reactions or synthetic procedures employing the sulfoxide form of a cephalosporin, the sulfoxide function is reduced to provide the cephalosporin molecule in the reduced or sulfide state. prior to this invention one preferred method for reducing cephalosporin sulfoxides was that of murphy et al., u.s. pat. no. 3,641,014. according to this method, cephalosporin sulfoxides are reduced with 1) hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst, 2) stannous, ferrous, cuprous, or manganous cations, 3) dithionite, iodide, or ferrocyanide, 4) trivalent phosphorous compounds, 5) halosilanes or 6) chloromethylene minium chlorides wherein certain of these reducing agents require the use of an activator such as acetyl chloride or phosphorous trichloride. for example, sodium dithionate is activated with acetyl chloride in the reduction. another method
