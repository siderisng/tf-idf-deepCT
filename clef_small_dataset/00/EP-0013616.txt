<ABSTRACT>
an ultrasonic thickness meter provides one or both of two  improved operational facilities.  the first enables the meter  probe to be zeroed at will to allow for the acoustic transmit time  of the stand-off material of the probe.  the second enables the  operator at the flick of a switch to display the difference 'plus  or minus' between the thickness of a workpiece being meas­ ured and that of a set standard.  the meter includes means (20)  to duplicate the acoustic transit time of a zero block or stan­ dard block electronically as a first time-value signal and  means (21, 33, 34, 35) to set up a second time-value signal  representing the time from excitation of the transmitter  crystal (tx) to receipt of the first return echo (e₁) from the far  side of the zero block or standard block.  these time-value  signals are combined under the control of manually operated  switches (27,28) to zero the probe or offset the probe to the set  standard.
