<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for use in a so-called knock-out or  shake-out system for foundries comprises a beam (1) which  may be resiliently suspended by a stirrup (2) and bellows (3).   a pair of tubular frames (9) depend from the ends of the  beam and a pair of rectangular clamp frames (11) are  vertically slidable in the tubular frames (9).  a mould box (17)  comprising a pair of box-frames (18a, 18b) and containing a  metal casting in a sand mould (20) is located between the  two pairs of frames.  two sets of bellows (15), one associated  with each clamp frame (11), are inflated to raise the clamp  frames (11) and clamp the box between the lower crosspiece  of these frames and some other part of the structure such as  the lower cross-piece (10b) of the tubular frames (9).  the  mould is vibrated by vibrators (16) so that the sand and  casting are shaken out of the box.
