<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides diesters of the formula  <chem>  wherein r and r1 are the same and each is selected from  <chem>  with r6 and r7 each being an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical of 3 to 10 carbon atoms; and y being 0-5;  r2 is a tertiary aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms or an alicyclic hydrocarbon radical having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, where the carbon atom of attachment to the aromatic ring is fully substituted;  r3 is hydrogen, halogen, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an alicyclic hydrocarbon radical having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms; and  r4 and r5 are each  <chem>  where a and a min  are independently selected from among hydrogen, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an alicyclic hydrocarbon radical of 3 to 10 carbon atoms.   <??>the invention includes compositions comprising a polymer and at least one diester of the formula given above.
