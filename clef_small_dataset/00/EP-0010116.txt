<ABSTRACT>
a device for controlling a hydraulic actuator (100) has a  fluid pressure operated main valve (20) controlled by a pilot  valve (19).  the force of a force motor (52) acting on the pilot  spool (40) is opposed by a feedback force produced by the  pressure difference applied by the pilot valve (19) to the main  valve control chambers (36 and 37) and also applied to feedÂ­ back chambers (55 and 56) of the pilot valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "improvements in or relating to hydraulic actuator controls" the present invention relates to hydraulic actuator controls and more particularly to a device for controlling hydraulic actuator means responsively to an electrical input signal comprising a main valve having a fluid pressure operated main sppol.for controlling the fluid supply to the actuator means, a pilot valve having a pilot spool for regulating the fluid pressure for operating the main spool, and an electrical force motor for producing a force dependent upon the electrical input signal and for applying such force to the pilot spool in opposition to a fluid pressure acting on the pilot spool. such a device is described in british patent specification no. 1,406,326 which discloses the use of a flow sensor for producing a pressure difference dependent upon the rate of fluid flow to the actuator means and for applying such pressure difference to the pilot spool in opposition to said force. by suitably designing the flow sensor as described in british patent specification no. 17135,042, an accurate correlation between the magnitude of the electrical input signal and the speed of the actuator means over a wide range of flow rates can be obtained. however there are occasions when it is more important to avoid the risk of instability arising through the presence of a closed servo loop (including the flow dependent feedback from the flow sensor to the pilot spool) than it is to obtain an accurate correlation between input and output. an object of the invention is to dispense with the closed servo loop including the flow sensor. another object is to use the position of the main spool as an indication of the rate of fluid flow to the actuator means. according to the present invention, the regulated fluid pressure for operating the main spool is also applied to the pilot spool in opposition to said force, whereby the position of the main spool, which is displaced by said regulated fluid pressure against a return spring, is determined by the electrical input signal for a given hydraulic supply pressure to the main valve and a given load on the actuator means, the rate of fluid flow to the actuator means is determined by the position of the main spool. since the latter is itself determined by the electrical input signal in the device according to the invention, the magnitude of the electrical input signal can be used to obtain a measure of control of the speed of the actuator means without the need to provide a flow sensor and the associated closed servo loop. the invention is further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a flow diagram of a fluid flow control device in accordance with the invention. the fluid flow control device comprises a main control valve 20 and a pilot valve 19 for controlling the main valve 20. the main and pilot valves are arranged in separate valve blocks which are bolted together with the
