<ABSTRACT>
a fluid pressure operated clutch (10) which transmits  torque from an engine output shaft (12) to a transmission  input shaft, including a rotatable flywheel (14) connected to  the output shaft, an adapter (20) connected to the flywheel  (14) for rotation with the flywheel (14), the adapter (20)  having a first annular plate (22) with a fluid passage (60) near  the inner periphery of the plate (22), and a centrifugal piston  (52) which defines with the adapter (20) a fluid chamber (64)  supporting a rotatable torus of hydraulic fluid.  the piston  (52) has a second annular plate (84), slideable with respect to  the first plate (22), an a second fluid passage (69) near the  outer periphery of the second plate.  the first and second  plates, at their inner peripheries, provide a controlled  clearance (60) to vary the rate of hydraulic fluid into the first  fluid chamber (64) as the second plate slides.  a centrifugal  relief valve (94) is connected to the piston (52) and has a  conical valve member removably seated on an outlet of the  valve to drain fluid from the chamber (64) through the  second passage (69) and the outlet when engine overspeed  occurs.  a clutch pack (46) of friction plates responds to  movement of the piston (52) to engage and disengage the  clutch (10).
