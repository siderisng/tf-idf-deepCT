<ABSTRACT>
The mixer has a crushing chamber (17), in which mixed material can be filled continuously as well as a circulation chamber (3ยน) associated with the crushing chamber (17) via a passage opening (10).The connecting opening (10) is shut-off.The continuously fed well can be predetermined in the crushing chamber (17) and condenses in the circulating chamber (3ยน) and cooled.In this case, the passage opening is closed during cooling.It can also be done in the crushing chamber a complete compression when the passage opening (10) closed.The mixing material is then given in part for cooling into the circulating chamber.
