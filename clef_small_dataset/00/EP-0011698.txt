<ABSTRACT>
In a pneumatic tire for utility vehicles mounted on flatbed rims, a rubber ring held in the cavity of the tire and on the rim by foot gain (8) is introduced, which is provided with a plurality of radial bores guaranteed with a plurality of air supply (10). With a total air loss of the tire, the rubber ring serves as an emergency ring for the ripe ceiling to be lowered. In order to prevent one after total air loss of the tire due to the strong friction and heat development in the onward journey of the vehicle, the emergency rotor ring is provided with circumferential grooves (15) which are coverable by sealing lip Pen, which contain lubricants and after they were closed in the air-filled tire by axial bias voltage and the tire air pressure, as a result of the pressure of the tire cover exerted on the distress ring on the distress ring on the distress ring, to be opened by lever strength to leave the lubricant to all frictional flap of the tire and the vehicle thereby the continuation the ride to secure a considerably long distance.
