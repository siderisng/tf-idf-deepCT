<ABSTRACT>
the compositions are formed as the reaction product,  preferably in an organic solvent, of phosphorous acid or pc1₃  and a water-soluble carboxyl polymer.  a precursor of phosphorous  acid, which precursor is capable of generating phosphorous  acid aqueous solution, may be used, and preferably,  the water-soluble carboxyl polymer has a relatively low  molecular weight, preferably in the range from about 400 to  about 6000.  the molar ratio of the reactants, namely of carboxyl  polymer, calculated as carboxyl groups to phosphorous  acid is in the range from about 10:1 to about 1:1.  the carboxyl  polymer, such as polyacrylic acid, may be derived from an  α,β-olefinically unsaturated monomer having a carboxyl  group, or the carboxyl polymer such as an acid anhydride  polymer may be derived from a monomer readily converted  to one having a carboxylic acid group.  cross reference to related application this is a continuation-in-part of our copending u. s.   patent application serial no.  835,660 filed september 22,  1977.
