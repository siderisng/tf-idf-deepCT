<ABSTRACT>
a method and a plant for recovery of oil floating on water.   the plant comprises a closed container (1), either submersible  or semi-submersible, floating in the sea with its upper edge (5)  at the boundary between oil and water.  the mixture of oil and  water floating on top of the container flows down through  holes (10) in the upper surface or collecting table (4) of the  container into the interior of the container.  the mixture is then  separated by settling and surplus water is discharged.  a so  called "calm bay" is formed above and in the immediate  vicinity of the container by a collar (9) reaching above the  surface and attached to the container, in order to gather the oil  to a thick layer, so that less water flows down into the con­ tainer.  after settling, the oil is pumped over to a tanker.  the  container can be equipped with heating coils (13) in order to  facilitate settling and enable pumping of the oil.  a number of  such containers can be combined to form a vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and plant for collecting of oil floating on water the present invention relates to a method and a plant for recovery of oil, spilled on a water surface. in the event of a collision with or grovding of a tanker or an accident at an off-shore oil well the oil as a rule is spilled on the water surface. the tankers of to-day being enormous, the damage of an oil spill would be devastating to beeches as well as to bird-life and fishing. if a really big accident occurs, gathering and recovery of the oil spill is beyond the capacity of-to-day's technique. there is a certain readiness for minor accidents and spills but major accidents demand a technique yet unknown. oil spills on water have thus far often been fought by chemical means, in order to sink the oil into the sea and make it harmless. at a large cost the ocean will be free from oil slicks but instead the vegetation at the bottom is given a large addition of nutriment. this causes large changes in the ecological system. in the event of major accidents, oil is spilled in large quantities representing a great economic value. by mechanical recovery of oil spill to-day booms are used to corral the oil slick and gather the oil to a layer of a thickness enough to enable mechanical collection from the water surface. the collection is performed either by suction or by means of skimmers. uk patent specification no. 947 026 discloses a skimmer. this plant operates satisfactory but has too low efficiency to be usable at big oil spills. one of the problems which must be solved at collecting of oil on a water surface is the fact that the oil is spread into a thin surface layer over a large area. in order to efficiently collect the oil, it is required that the oil layer is thickened. this is customary performed by means of oil booms arranged in the form of a v. the oil corralled by the booms is gathered at the apex of the v and thereby making the oil layer thicker. the collected mixture of oil and water is pumped by pumping means from the water surface to a separation vessel where the oil is settled or separated from the water. the water is given off to the surroundings. norwegian laid-open specification no. 129 469 discloses such a plant which can be used in connection with oil booms or separately. this plant includes a funnelshaped floating body floating with the mouth of the funnel positioned in the vicinity of the boundary between oil and water. the mixture collected by the funnel is pumped though pipes and tubes to a separation vessel placed above the water surface. the floating body is of a so called semi-submersible type and its height in the water is set by means of ballast tanks and suitable valve means. the floating body essentially follows the movements of the waves. the plant according

claims:    1. a method for recovering oil spilled on water, characterized in floating a closed container of a submersible or semi-submersible type   comprisìng an upper      surface    (4) surrounded by an adjustable edge (5) with said edge positioned adjacent to the boundary between oil and water; flowing the mixture of oil and water floating over said edge through holes in the upper surface of the container to the interior of the container placed below the water surface; settling the mixture i.e. separating the oil from the water in the container below the surrounding water surface and discharging the separated water to the surroundings; and forming a calm bay above and in the vicinity of or around the container by means of a collar attached to the container and extending above the water surface and said upper surface.    2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in discharging the separated oil to a tanker or similar.    3. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in heating the mixture in the container and heating the upper surface (4) in order to lower the viscosity of the oil.    4. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in adjusting the depth and inclination of the container by means of trim tanks (7) and compensation tanks (8) and adjusting the height of the edge (5) in relation to the container.    5. a plant for recovering oil spilled on water, characterized by a closed container   (1)    having an upper surface (4) and a lower surface (2) and side walls (3), the container being immersed in the sea and having enclosed a mixture of oil and water and a certain amount of air, the container comprising ballast tanks (14), compensation tanks (8) and trim tanks (7) and a control equipment for adjusting the depth and inclination of the container in the water thereby positioning an adjustable edge (5) of the container adjacent to the boundary between the oil and the water; the upper surface (4) of the container including holes (10) enabling the mixture of oil and water floating into the interior of the container over said edge in order to settle in said interior below the surrounding water surface;  an outlet (11) of the container being adpated to discharge the separated water to the surroundings; the container comprising a collar (9) extending above the water   surface-on    the outside  and at a distance from said edge (5) in order to encircle an area of the water surface and form a calm bay together with the upper surface of the container.    6. a plant as claimed in claim 5, characterized by an outlet (12) for discharging the separated oil to an oil tanker or similar.    7. a plant as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the container comprises one or several heating devices (13, 33) in order to heat the mixture in the container and the upper surface.     8. a plant as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the collar (9) surrounds the container along at least 1800; and that the edge (5) is divided into segments which are separately vertically adjustable.    9. a plant as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the upper surface (4) of the container is funnel-shaped and includes a hole (10) at the centre thereof for intake of said mixture, the flow through said hole being controlled by a valve and pump means.    10. a plant as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that a plurality of containers are combined to a vessel (20) of a submersible or sem-submersible type, said vessel comprising a fore ship body (22) and an aft ship body (23); of which the bulwark (27), the fore ship body (22) and the aft ship body (23) together'with the upper surfaces (30) of the containers form said calm bay.
