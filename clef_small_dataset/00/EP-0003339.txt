<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for accurately positioning a transducer head relative to a plurality of recording tracks, in particular on a magnetic tape consisting of a frame part with a control stage device movable thereon and a carrier connected to a motion transfer device for the transducer head. The amount of movement of the transducer head is smaller than the amount of movement of the movement transmission device, so that the transducer head is adjusted accordingly in smaller steps than the steps of the steps. The movement transmission device consists of a pivot lever (55), which rests on the support end on the control stage device on the one hand and on the other hand carries a platform with the transducer head (13). A rotation of the control stage device moves the pivot lever. The transducer head is also positioned very precisely by further fine adjustment devices to each individual track of the recording medium. An azimuth setting of the transducer head is automatically ensured.
