<ABSTRACT>
foamed phenolic material having satisfactory mechaniÂ­ cal and thermal insulation properties comprise the reaction  product of a mixture comprising a phenolic resin and an  epoxy resin, the reaction being effected in the presence of a  foaming or blowing agent, a catalyst, a reinforcing material, at  least one filler material and, optionally, a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "expanded phenolic materials" the present invention relates to improved expanded phenolic materials. foamed or expanded thermosetting phenolic resins, when fully cured, are thermal insulators which exhibit low flammability and generate minimal smoke on forced combustion. for this reason they have been used as interlayers in various types of sandwich structures, i.e. double-skinned composites with the expanded phenolic material as an interlayer, used in the building and allied industries. expanded phenolic materials in current use, however, generally suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages: (i). poor mechanical and load bearing properties, (ii) extreme friability of surface structure, (iii) poor abrasion resistance, (iv) less than optimum thermal insulative properties when compared to polyurethanes, c) a tendency to some surface spread of flame, and (vi) a type of auto-ignition characteristic termed "punking". a further disadvantage of expanded phenolic materials in current use is that the "limiting oxygen index (toy) is often in the region of 35 to 45% oxygen. the limiting oxygen index is the concentration of oxygen necessary in an atmosphere to allow a sample of the expanded phenolic material, situated in that atmosphere, to be ignited. the relatively low limiting oxygen index values often encountered with currently available expanded phenolic materials limit their range of application in that they are not suitable for use in potentially high fire-risk situations. by practice of the present invention there may be provided an expanded or foamed phenolic material having considerably improved mechanical properties, enaanced fire resistance, a significant increase in the limiting oxygen index value, and which is not subject to "punking" or surface friability. according to the present invention there is provided an expanded or foamed phenolic material formed by reacting a mixture comprising a phenolic resin and an epoxy resit in the presence of a foaming or blowing agent, a catalyst, a reinforcing material and at least one filler material. the phenolic resin used in producing the expanded phenolic material of the present invention can, for example, be a liquid phenolic resin or a solution of a phenolic resin, e.g., a solid phenolic resin, in a suitable solvents the phenolic resin used may, for examples be in the "bn stage and curable to form a fully crosslinked, insoluble "c" stage material. an example of a suitable phenolic resin for use in preparing the expanded phenolic material of the present invention is a phenolic resin of the rest type. preferably, the resol type resin is prepared by condensing a phenol, e.g., phenol, with formaldehyde paraferm- aldehyde or like material. for example, 1 mole @f the phenol may be condensed with 1 to 3 moles of formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde or like material, the phenolic resin used in forming the expande@ phenolic material of the present invention may have a viscosity of, for example, approximately 20 poises at ambient temperature. the phenolic resin may, for example, also have a solids content of approximately 76% and/or a specific gravity of approximately 1.3 and/or a hot plate cure time of approximately 65 seconds. suitable phenolic
