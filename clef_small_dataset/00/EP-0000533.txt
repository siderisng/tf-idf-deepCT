<ABSTRACT>
n-substituted 9,10-dihydrolyergic acid esters of the for Mel wherein R₁ alkyl radicals having 1-5 C atoms, alkenyl radicals with 2-5 C atoms or cycloalkyl radicals with 3-5 C atoms, R₂ hydrogen or alkoxy radicals with 1-3 c atoms and x are hydrogen or halogen, wherein the compound, wherein R₁ mean methyl or ethyl radicals and R₂ and x hydrogen, and the compound wherein R₁ is a methyl radical, R₂ are a methoxy group and x hydrogen, are taken out, as interconnections for the synthesis from therapeutically highly effective compounds as well as traveling to their preparation by reacting given facts esterified 9,10-dihydrolylsergic acids of the general formula wherein R is hydrogen or an organic radical of alkaline medium and X and R₂ have the meanings given above, with a compound of general formula R₁Y (III) where R₁ has the meaning given under formula I and Y halogen or Sulfate means in the presence of a catalytic gate for phase transmission, a water non-mixed inert organic solvent ind, an alkaline aqueous phase. These methods are characterized by well-known methods by good selectivity, a fing and clamping course, wherein the reaction can be easily controlled, the use of conventional solvents from which the water does not need to be removed, as well as by reaction conditions, Allow safe work. The compounds are important interconnections for the synthesis of therapeutic highly effective compounds with n-substituted group in the 1-position.
