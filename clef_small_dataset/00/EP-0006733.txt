<ABSTRACT>
a golf club head, specifically a wood for use on the fairway  or in trouble spots, such as sand traps, hard pan, or in the rough.   the wood incorporates a metal sole plate which comprises a  major portion of the lower face of the head and at least half of the  total weight of the head.  the sole plate has a pair of spaced  parallel runners extending well below the plate and being of  substantial cross section, the runners having inclined leading  faces to ride or skid on the ground surface with minimum  penetration.  the weight and shape of the sole plate provides a  low center of mass in the head, with the weight distributed over  the lower face.

<DESCRIPTION>
golf club iad background of the invention in lofting a golf ball out of a trouble spot, such as rough or a sand trap, it is customary to use an iron, sand wedge, or the like, with considerable mass in the head to provide the necessary inertia and overcome resistance. the ball is usually struck in a downward direction to impart a back spin to retard rolling on the green and is lofted out by continued motion of the club, the head usually striking the ground immediately after contacting the ball. when the leading edge of the head strikes the ground surface or cuts through grass, the sharp leading edge has a tendency to dig into the turf, greatly reducing the power of the blow and including the possibility of deflecting the club from the desired path. ribbing or corrugation of the lower surface of the head has been used to reduce contact area, but there is still a large surface which must be forced through obstacles and the results have not been very satisfactory. a wood with a pronounced curvature in the sole has been developed for use in the rough or on the fairway, but does not have sufficient mass for good penetration. in weighting a wood the weight is usually centrally located behind the striking point and the weight distribution in the head is not particularly good. additionally a wood with a sole shaped like a single keel of a boat has been produced. however, this has a sharp leading edge which encourages penetration and greatly reduces the continued power of the swing. summary of the invention the golf club head described herein is a wood with the cutting advantages of an iron or fairway wood, combined with the skidding advantage of a sand iron. a wood type head is provided with a metal sole plate extending over the lower surface of the head and constituting about 55% of the total weight of the head. the mass is concentrated in the lower portion of the head, which lowers the center of mass and increases inertia and driving power. the weight is also spread to the edges of the wood for improved weight distribution and balance. to improve stability the sole plate has a pair of spaced parallel runners of large cross section extending from front to rear, one rib being near the toe and the other adjacent the heel of the sole. the runners are generally semicircular in cross section and extend well below the lower face of the sole plate. the leading faces of the runners are inclined downwardly and rearwardly to act as skids and slid through and over the ground surface with minimum penetration. in grass the resistance is also reduced since the runners keep the body of the head above the surface and the full width of the leading edge does not penetrate so deeply into the grass. on the fairway the head has the characteristics of a wood, but the added weight

 claims 1. a golf club head, comprising:  a wood body having a front striking face, a lower sole with a toe portion and a heel portion, and means for attachment to a shaft;  a metal sole plate fixed to said sole and having a pair of spaced parallel runners projecting downwardly therefrom and extending from front to rear across the sole plate;  said sole plate having a leading edge below said striking face;  and said runners having leading faces inclined downwardly and rearwardly from said leading edge.   2. a golf club head according to claim 1, wherein said sole plate extends over the major portion of said sole.   3. a golf club head according to claim 1, wherein the weight of said sole plate constitutes at least 50% of the total weight of the head.    4. a golf club head according to claim 1, wherein said sole plate extends over a major portion of said sole and constitutes approximately 55% of the total weight of the head.   5. a golf club head according to claim 1, wherein one of said runners is adjacent said toe portion and the other is adjacent said heel portion.     6. a golf club head according to claim 5, wherein each of said runners is substantially semi-circular in cross section, with a depth of about 0.30 inch and a width of about 0. 55 inc.   7. a golf club head according to claim 6, wherein said runners are spaced apart approximately 1. 25 inches between   centers.      8. a golf club head according to claim 1, wherein said leading faces are inclined at approximately 55 degrees to the lower surfaces of the respective runners.
