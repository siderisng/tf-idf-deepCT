<ABSTRACT>
titanium dichloride and or titanium trichloride is produced  directly from a titaniferous ore such as ilmenite by  means of a selective chlorination reaction.  a mixture of  particles of the ore and particles of carbon is contacted at a  temperature greater than 1500Â°c with a quantity of chlorine  less than that required in theory for the production of  titanium tetrachloride, for example, from 0. 75 to 1. 75 moles  of chlorine per mole of titanium dioxide.  provided a sufficient  quantity of carbon is used the iron content of the ore may be  converted into the metallic form and recovered as such.  the  titanium chlorides produced may be further chlorinated to  titanium tetrachloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
production of titanium chlorides this invention relates to the production of titanium compounds and, in particular, to the production of titanium chlorides. there is described in us patent no. 2 589 466 a process for the direct proauction of titanium tetrachloride from an iron-containing titaniferous ore by the selective chlorination of the iron content of the ore without allowing any iron present in the ore to be chlorinated. the process involves separately pre-heating ilmenite and chlorine tc a temperature between 0 0 1250 and 1450 c and maintaining them at such a temperature while bringing them together for reaction. british patent no. 1 431 480 makes reference to us patent 2 589 466 reports that attempts to repeat the process of the us patent had failed and suggests that this is consistent with the findings reported in the following papers: suomen kemistilehti, 29a, pages 220-225 (1956) chemical abstracts (1957) 4801(f) transactions of the metallurgical society of aime, 218, pages 219-225 (april 1960). british patent o. 1 431 480 proposes an alternative prccess for the chlorination of the titanium constituent of a titaniferous material at a temperature of from 95o0c to 14000c in the presence of a carbonaceous material and a chlorinating agent comprising iron chloride. titanium trichioride may be produced from titanium tetrachloride. titanium dichloride may also be produced from titanium tetrachloride or, alternatively, from titanium trichloride. the present invention provides a process whereby the titanium di- and/or trichlorides, hereafter referred to collectively as lower titanium chloride, may be produced directly from a titaniferous ore. in its broadest aspect the present invention provides a process for the production of titanium lower chloride characterised forming a mixture of particles of a titaniferous ore and particles of carbon the mixture 0 having a temperature greater than 1500 c and contacting with the particles chlorine in a quantity less than that required in theory for the conversion of the titanium values in the ore to titanium tetrachloride. preferably the mixture of particles in the form of a gaseous dispersion is contacted with the chlorine. according to a preferred aspect of the present invention the ore is an iron-containing titaniferous ore, for example ilmenite r or rutile, or a synthetic rutile and the particles are cause to react with chlorine according to one or both of the equations feo.tio2 + 3c + c12 = 3co + fe + tic12 feo.tio2 + 3c + liy12 = 3co + fe + tic13 and the resulting titanium lower chloride is separated from the metallic iron produced. preferably a hot gaseous dispersion is heated according to this invention to at least 15500c, however, to avoid loss of reaction selectively to the desired products and the production of minor quantities of iron chlorides and/or titanium tetrachloride it is particularly preferred to maintain the temperature at at least l6000c. the energy input required for the reaction of the ore particles with chlorine according to the invention is higher for higher reaction temperatures quite apart from the tendency to increased heat
