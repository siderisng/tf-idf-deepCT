<ABSTRACT>
although carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (c. a. i. ) can be  administered systemically by oral or intravenous routes,  attempts to administer them topically have been ineffective  and inactive in the treatment of intraocular hypertension.  the  alkali metal salts, especially the sodium and potassium salts,  of salt-forming carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in combination  with s-(-)-1- (tert-butylamino) -3-[(4-morpholino-­ 1,2,5-thiadiazol -3-yl)oxy] -2-propanol or its racemic  modification are now found to be remarkably effective in  lowering intraocular pressure, even in normotensive hosts,  but especially in those hosts having an elevated intraocular  pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
ophthalmic compositions comprising combinations of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and s-(-)-1-(tert butylamino)-3- (4-morpholino-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl)- oxy -2-propanol for topical application in the treat ment of elevated intraocular pressure disclosure of the invention: this invention relates to compositions comprising carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and s-(-)l-(tert-butylamino)-3-[(4-morpholino-1,2,5-thiadiazol3-yl)oxy]-2-propanol or its racemic modification that are topically effective in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure. more particularly, it relates to compositions comprising a combination of s-(-)-l (tert-butylamino) -3- [(4-morpholino-l,2 , 5-thiadiazol-3- yl)oxy]-2-propanol or its racemic modification and an alkali metal salt of a salt-forming carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that, when applied topically to the eye, is transported to the target ocular tissue(s). in particular, this invention relates to a combination of s- (-) -1- (tert-butylamino) -3- [(4-morpholino-l,2,5- thiadiazol-3-yl)oxy]-2-propanol or its racemic modification and a sodium or potassium salt of a saltforming carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and the use thereof to lower intraocular pressure, especially in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. it should be noted that, throughout this invention, the s-(-o-l-(tert-butylamino)-3-f(4-morpholino-l,2,5- thiadiazol-3-yl)oxy3-2-propanol can be replaced by its racemic modification. glaucoma is a degenerative disease of the eye wherein the pressure in the eye (i.e. introacular pressure) is too high for the normal function of the eye and as result¯damage occurs to the optic. nerve head and results in irreversible loss of visual function. if untreated, glaucoma will eventually lead to blindness. ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field loss, is now believed by the majority of ophthalmologists to merely represent the earliest phase in the onset of glaucoma. a number of the drugs presently employed to treat glaucoma are not entirely satisfactory, particularly in the earliest course of the disease when the side effects they produce are often worse than the symptoms of the disease. a patient who is in the very early stages of the onset of glaucoma and is experiencing no overt discomfort symptoms will even, with high motivation, tend to neglect the regular administration of medication. at this stage, no pathogen has as yet developed and only elevated intraocular pressure is present. thus, ocular hypertension may be present for an extended period prior to reaching the stage of pathological damage. pilocarpine, for example, although systemically harmless and quite effective, causes considerable local difficulties. the pupil constricts so that little light becomes available to the eye and the eye loses its ability to adapt from light to dark. accommodation is stimulated so that the patients refraction is sometimes incorrect and vision is blurred. the drug itself causes a local vasodilitation and red eyes and irritation are common. in short, although valuable, it really is unsatisfactory as a first line drug. when carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are used systemically they have a number of disadvantages. while extremely effective in lowering intraocular pressure, they often cause a numbness and tingling, gastrointestinal upsets and, frequently, depression, lethargy, and a loss of appetite, and general malaise. these, in addition to the occasional more severe systemic complications such as plastic anemia, are so
