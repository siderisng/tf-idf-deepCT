<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a chloral derivative having  the general formula    in which y8 is a polysaccharide consisting of a chain of anhydroglucose,  modified anhydroglucose or uronic acid units as  substituent group and in which r is selected from -h,  -coch₂oh,-[(ch₂)no]x-h in which n is 2 to 5 and x is 1 to 7;  -ch₂oso₂x′ or -ch₂coox′ in which x′ is nh₄ or a single  equivalent of a non-toxic metallic cation, -(ch₂)nh where n is 1  to 7, -(ch₂)n (-oh)xy where y is -h or -ch₃n is 1 to 7, x is 1 to 12  and the -oh groups are attached to any or all of the carbon  atoms by substitution and wherein when y¹ is a chain of  unmodified anhydroglucose units, these units have the following  configurations:-   α-d-glucopyranosyl units having a predominantly 1 - 4 linkage   β-d-glucopyranosyl units having a predominantly 1 - 4 linkage  and/or   β-d-glucopyranosyl units having a predominantly 1 - 4 linkage  when c₆ is a carboxylic acid group.
