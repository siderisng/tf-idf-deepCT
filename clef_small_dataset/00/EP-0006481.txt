<ABSTRACT>
in magnetic bubble domain storage systems, it is important that the data exit from the storage in the same sequence in which it entered the storage.  in major/minor loop memory organizations using separate read and write major paths, this is easily achieved with gapped progagation elements such as t-bars, c-bars, half disks, and chevrons.  however, because contiguous disk propagation elements are gapless, this has not been achieved.  to solve this, a data reversal switch is provided which reverses the order of the data before it is entered into the minor loop storage registers.  when the data is removed from the minor loops, it will have the same sequence as it had initially, thus avoiding data reversal.  the data reversal switch is comprised of two adjacent, oppositely propagating contiguous propaation element patterns in which a parallel transfer of sequentially written data can be made.  this reverses the order of the data from what it was initially, so that upon exiting from the storage loops the initial order will again be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
bubble domain storage chip. the invention relates to a magnetic bubble domain storage chip comprised of patterns of contiguous magnetic propagation elements having in-plane magnetization, along which patterns move bubble domains in response to the continuous reorientation of a magnetic field through a plurality of cycles, said magnetic field reorienting in the same sense in each of said cycles, said patterns forming a first shift register for serially moving a first data sequence pattern of magnetic bubble domains, a plurality of storage registers for storing said bubble domains received from said first shift register, and a second shift register for serially moving bubble domains in a data pattern receded from said storage registers. an important systems requirement for magnetic bubble domain storage arrays is that the data must exit from storage in the same sequence in whicb it entered the storage. in most storage organizations this is easily achieved when gapped propagation elements are used. this is so because data can be transferred to the gapped elements from either side of the element and can travel along the pattern of the elements in a preferred direction in accordance with the sense of rotation of an in-plane drive field. for example, a pattern of t-bars, c-bars, half disks, or chevrons, can be used to move bubble domains in either of two directions depending upon the direction of rotation of the in-plane drive field. bubble domains can be transferred to the propagation pattern from either side of the pattern and the pattern can be used to move bubble dcmains in a preferred direction. in contrast with this, contiguous propagation elements are provided by ion implanting regions in a magnetic layer or by apertured regions in a contir..lous magnetic layer. as is well known, bubble domains travel along the edges of the ion implanted regions or along the edges of the apertured regions, staying at all times under the magnetic layer having in-plane magnetization. in such structures, it is not easy to move a bubble domain across a non-ion implanted region or across a region in which the in-plane magnetic layer is absent. thus, when bubble domains are transferred to a propagation pattern comprising contiguous propagation elements, transfer is to the nearest edge of the elements and the bubble domain cannot easily be moved across the propagation elements to the opposite edge. instead, the bubble domain gets to the opposite edge of the propagation elements only by travelling around the full propagation pattern. if the nearest edge is one which will not propagate the bubbles in a direction to preserve data order, then the afor√ßmentioned reversal problem will occur. as an example, a propagation pattern comprising contiguous disks can be used to move bubble domains in response to the reorientation of a magnetic field in the plane of the propagation elements. a bubble domain which is transferred to this propagation pattern will stay along the edge to which it is transferred and cannot be easily moved across the propagation pattern to the opposite
