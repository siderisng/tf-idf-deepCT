<ABSTRACT>
a tag which is preferably for animal identification purposes.  the tag (10) comprises two components (11, 12) with one (11) component hingedly coupled to the other (12).  a mounting member (17, 18) extends from one component (11) and engagement means (20) are provided with the other component (12).  the mounting member (17, 18) and engagement means (20) are each spaced away from the hinge coupling (15) so that by movement of the components (11, 12) about the hinge (15) the mounting member (17, 18) can be brought into engagement with the engagement means (20).  the component (11) having the mounting member (17, 18) further has receiving means (21) in which the or part of the mounting member of a second tag can be located when said second tag is nested with a first tag.  an applicator tool is also disclosed and is characterised in that it has a magazine (41) in which a stack of nested tags can be loaded.  operating means are provided whereby one tag of the stack can be applied to say an animal's ear.  the applied tag is automatically replaced by the next tag in the stack.
