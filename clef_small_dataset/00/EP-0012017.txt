<ABSTRACT>
the memory modules of a computer are provided with  means for checking the operation of the error-correcting cir­ cuits under program control.  field testing hitherto has been  carried out by writing test patterns into the memory array but  this is time-consuming and relies on the assumption that the  memory array is operating correctly, which, in many cases, is  unrealistic.  the invention provides means whereby the cir­ cuits may be tested directly under software control.  the invention provides mode setting means (31) by which  the program is enabled to set one or more digits in a status  register (21) in the memory module, placing it in a mainte­ nance mode.  in this mode transfer of data between the mem­ ory array (22) and the data register (27) is prevented, and the  program is enabled to write into and read from the data  register directly.  two digit positions of the status register (21) may be  used, one of them (2¹⁸) when set enabling the program to  write into and read from data positions in a holding register  within the data register (27), and the other when set enabling  the program to write into the error code positions in that  register.  when neither digit is set, address instructions from  the central processing unit (10) address the memory array (22)  in the usual way.
