<ABSTRACT>
a pressure sensitive label strip (1) comprising a tape-like  strip of label material (2) that is overlaid on a tape-like strip of  backing material (4); parting cut lines (6) extend transversely  across the strip of label material at regular intervals so as to  form a plurality of unit label pieces (l); feeding cut lines (7)  are defined in the effective portions of each unit label piece  except the marginal portion of the label piece to form feeding  tongues, and other feeding cut lines (8) are defined in the  backing material at the positions corresponding to the above  former feeding cut lines to form feeding tongues which are  of different shape from that of the former feeding tongues.   further, the above cut lines are effective for preventing the  occurrence of unprinted portion and unfair switching of  labels.

<DESCRIPTION>
description pressure sensitive label strip this invention relates to a tape-like, pressure sensitive label strip for use in a hand-held label printing and dispensing machine (hereinafter referred to simply as a "label printing machine"). more particularlw, the in.vention relates. to the feeding cuts in the label strip by which the label strip is advanced through the label printing machine when they are engaged by feeding pins formed on a feeding roller and the hand lever of the machine is squeezed and released. these feeding cut lines are also serviceable as the cuts for preventing the unfair switching of labels. the pressure sensitive label strip of this kind comprises a long, thin strip layer of label material having an adhesive coating layer and a long, thin strip layer of backing material having a releasing agent coating layer. the strip of label material has a plurality of transverse parting cut lines and a large number of unit label pieces are formed among these parting cut lines. feeding cut lines are formed across each parting cut line in the label material. at the positions corresponding to the above feeding cut lines, other feeding cut lines are defined in the backing material. such the prior art label strip is convenient to be advanced through the label printing machine. fleanwilile, the respective feeding cut lines of label material and backing material are temporaril stood up when the feeding cut lines are brought into engagement with the feeding pins of the feeding roller in a label printing machine. after that, the erected feeding tongues are depressed flat by a label correcting member which is attached to the printing head and the label strip is advanced into the printing sections. the label material is thesprdted, however, the erected tongue of the backing material is often pressed down over the front edge portion of a unit label piece during the correction of the erected feeding tongue because the feeding cut line of the backing material is located just under the parting cut line of the label material. accordingly, such the overlapped portion in the front side of the unit label piece cannot be printed the printed label material is then peeled off from the backing material and the peeled unit label piece is applied to the surface of merchandise. in this operation the feeding tongue of the above feeding cut lines is liable to be erected again. the erected tongues on the front and rear edges of the unit label pieces be corrected by rubbing them with an applicator roller when it is applied to merchandise, however, the erected feeding tongue on the front side is often left standing since it exists outside the range of rolling of the applicator roller. accordingly, the appearance of the label is not good, in addition, the unfair switching of labels can easily be done. it is the principal object of the present invention to provide an improved label strip with feeding tongues. it is another object of the present invention to
