</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention: crystalline n-formimidoyl thienamycin. background of the invention: this invention relates to crystalline nformimidoyl thienamycin and a process for its preparation. the antibiotic n-formimidoyl thienamycin (i) is known, see for example, belgium patent no. 848,545 (issued may 20, 1977): emi1.1 the crystalline form of n-formimidoyl thienamycin which is disclosed and claimed by this application is prepared from a lyophilized sample of i and is found to have unexpected stability in the solid state over the lyophilized form. detailed description of the invention: the description and claimed crystalline nformimidoyl thienamycin exists as a monohydrate and is unambiguously identified by the following parameters of the crystal which were obtained by x-ray powder diffraction. peak peak position intensity position intensity 2- e d-spgcing 2- 0 d-spacing (cuka) ) (a) i/io (cuka) (a) i/io 9.75 9.07 100 26.9 3.31 75 11.35 7.80 40 28.7 3.11 37 13.85 6.39 11 29.9 2.99 17 14.5 6.11 4 30.8 2.90 7 15.75 5.63 14 31.85 2.81 12 17.5 5.06 30 32.6 2.75 10 18.9 4.69 27 32.9 2.72 10 19.6 4.53 12 33.4 2.68 5 20.0 4.44 14 33.9 2.64 10 21.45 4.14 30 34.8 2.58 26 21.75 4.08 36 35.6 2.52 14 22.3 3.98 45 37.0 2.43 5 22.9 3.88 30 38.3 2.35 9 23.3 3.82 28 39.3 2.29 6 24.3 3.66 33 40.0 2.25 9 25.35 3.52 24 42.0 2.20 14 25.8 3.45 20 42.4 2.14 18 crystalline n-formimidoyl thienamycin monohydrate is prepared from a water/ethanol solution of nformimidoyl thienamycin. the following specific example illustrates the crystallization. example 1 crystalline n-formimidoyl thienamycin a lyophilized sample of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (62 mg) is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water and diluted with 5.5 ml of 95% ethanol. the resulting solution is immersed in an ice-bath, stirred with a magnetic stirrer and seeded with n-formimidoyl thienamycin monohydrate crystals obtained by a procedure described immediately below. after 1-1/2 hours stirring, the crystals are recovered by centrifugation. after decantation, the crystals are washed with 1 ml of ethanol and dried under vacuum at 500c for 1 hour to yield 56 mg of crystalline n-formimidoyl thienamycin monohydrate. the seed crystals employed in the above crystallization are prepared by the following procedure: a lyophilized sample of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (24.5 mg) is dissolved in 0.5 ml of water, diluted to 3.0 ml with ethyl alcohol and stored in the freezer (-50c). after two weeks, crystals are observed on the walls of the glass tube. n-formimidoyl thienamycin is used as an antibiotic, as disclosed in the belgian patent 848,545, referred to above. in the treatment of bacterial infections in man, the compound of this invention is administered orally or parenterally, in accordance with conventional procedures for antibiotic administration, in an amount of from about 2 to 600 mg/kg/day and preferably about 15 to 150 mg/kg/day in preferably divided dosage, e.g. three to four times a day. they may be administered in dosage units containing, for example 25, 250, 500 or 1000 mg. of active ingredient with suitable physiologically acceptable carriers or
