<ABSTRACT>
a float operated electrical switch assembly has a housing  (10) fitted to an opening in a container wall (14).  a  float (19) follows the liquid level and is pivoted with a  primary magnet (18) about a pivot axis (17).  a pivotal  secondary magnet (21) acts in repulsion with the primary  magnet (18) through a non-magnetic wall (20) of the  housing (10).  the movement of the secondary magnet  (21) causes at least one control rod (48) to reciprocate.   a switch contact (32) is normally held under the resilience  of its carrier leaf spring (38) in engagement with a fixed  switch contact (33).  the contacts are opened by movement  of the control rod (48) moving the switch contact  (32) against the resilience of its carrier.
