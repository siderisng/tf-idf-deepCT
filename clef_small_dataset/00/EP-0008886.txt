<ABSTRACT>
a method of and apparatus for manufacturing a beverage  package such as a bottle, carton or can containing beer, lager,  ale, or stout.  to alleviate contamination of the beverage in the  sealed package by oxygen, the headspace of the container is  filled prior to sealing of the container, with a froth or foam  formed remotely from the container by the (or a different)  beverage and carbon dioxide and/or an inert gas such as  nitrogen.  the froth or foam is fed into the headspace of the  containers (15) between the beverage filling and sealing sta­ tions by way of outlets (21) forming part of a rotary valve (14).   the containers (15) are moved sequentially along a circular  path (16) by a star wheel; a plate (19) of the valve (14) is carried  on struts (17) by, and to rotate in unison with, the starwheel  and relative to a fixed plate (19) of the valve.  relative rotation  between the plates (18) and (19) controls the valve to deter­ mine the flow of preformed froth or foam from a supply  conduit (9) to the outlets (21) which are carried by and rotate  with the plate (18).  preferably the valve is arranged so that the  froth or foam is delivered to the containers (15) only while  such containers are located on the starwheel below the  respective outlets (21).
