<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus comprises integrated circuit chips (10)  which are to be cooled.  heat is conducted from the chips (10) to a cold plate (36)  by a heat transfer path including spring biased heat conduct足 ing members (26) and housing (16).  a thermal adapter (42) is sandwiched between the hous足 ing (16) and the cold plate (36) and introduces predetermined  heat transfer characteristics between the housing and the  plate.  the adapter can be a good or poor conductor.  the adap足 ter can comprise cut-out regions aligned with low powered  chips to increase the thermal resistance to heat flow from  those chips while the remaining regions, aligned with high  powered chips, have a lower thermal resistance.  this per足 mits both the low and high powered chips to attain their  optimum operating temperature.
