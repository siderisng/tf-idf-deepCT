<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure relates to high chloride, silver halide  developing out emulsions, their method of preparation and  photographic elements having coated thereon such silver  halide emulsions.  the silver halide emulsions are characte­ rized as having silver halide grains which are internally  doped with cadmium, lead, zinc, copper or mixtures thereof  in speed increasing concentrations up to 7 × 10⁻⁵ mole/­ mole/mole of silver halide.  in the figure are shown the relative speeds for cadmium  (a) lead (b), copper (c) and zinc (d) doped emulsions.

<DESCRIPTION>
internally doped high chloride silver halide emulsions, processes for their preparation and photographic elements this invention is directed to improved photographic developing out high chloride silver halide emulsions, to methods of preparing such emulsions, and to photographic elements having coated thereon such emulsions. there are many commercial photographic elements comprising radiation-sensitive silver halide emulsions of the developing out type. that is, the emulsions are rendered developable in areas where imagewise exposure to light occurs and are contacted with a developer solution to produce a visible image. silver bromide and silver bromoiodide emulsions have been preferentially used for higher speed imaging applications. as compared with silver bromide and silver bromoiodide, high chloride silver halide emulsions and photographic elements of the developing out type offer distinct advantages in a number of respects. for example, silver chloride possesses less native sensitivity in the visible region of the spectrum than silver bromide, thereby permitting yellow filter layers to be omitted from multicolor photographic elements. further, high chloride silver halides are more soluble than silver bromide and silver bromoiodide, thereby permitting development to be achieved in shorter times. unfortunately these advantages of high chloride silver halides have frequently not been realized in higher speed imaging applications, since the relatively higher speeds of silver bromide and silver bromoiodide have dictated their use. there is thus a long standing problem in the art in providing high chloride silver halide emulsions of the developing out type of increased photographic speed. in accordance with the invention, this problem is solved with silver halide emulsions of the developing out type comprised of silver halide grains which are at least 80 mole percent silver chloride and less than 5 mole percent silver iodide, based on total silver halide, characterized in that the silver halide grains are internally doped with cadmium, lead, copper, zinc or mixtures thereof in a speed increasing amount of up to 7 x 10-5 mole per mole of silver halide. more generally 2 x 10-6 to 7 x 10-5 mole per mole of silver halide of the metal dopant is utilized. the emulsions of the invention can be prepared by reacting a water soluble silver salt with a water soluble halide salt in an aqueous medium containing a peptizer to form radiation-sensitive silver halide grains. the water soluble silver and halide salts are present in amounts so that silver halide grains are formed that are at least 80 mole percent silver chloride and less than 5 mole percent silver iodide. water soluble salts of cadmium, lead, copper, zinc or mixtures thereof are introduced into the aqueous reaction medium during formation of silver halide grains in amounts up to 7 x 10-5 mole per mole of silver halide. these novel emulsions can be coated on photographic supports in the usual manner to prepare photographic elements. the high chloride silver halide emulsions of the invention containing low concentrations of divalent metal ion dopants as described above exhibit increased photographic speeds. thus, such emulsions and photographic elements offer the art recognized
