<ABSTRACT>
new alloys containing gold, vanadium, and yttrium  and/or scandium, and optionally including niobium are  described.  the alloys particularly suitable for brazing  and for metallizing, most particularly for brazing hermetic  ceramic-metal seals, e. g.  between electrical leads and  ceramic insulators.  the alloys may for example contain 4-15% vanadium  0. 008-0. 2% yttrium and/or scandium, and 0-3% niobium,  the balance being gold (atomic percentages).  there is also described a method of forming a brazed  joint between a central elongated conductor (10) and a  generally cylindrical body (12) of rigid insulating material  surrounding the conductor, comprising: forming a peripheral  outwardly extending shoulder on the conductor at  one location along its length, placing a preform of brazing  material on top of the insulating body, preparing a joint  by positioning the conductor within the insulating body  with the shoulder immediately above the preform and the  joint area and in contact therewith, and melting the preform  causing at least part of it to flow under the shoulder  and into the joint (22) area where it is cooled to form a  brazed joint.
