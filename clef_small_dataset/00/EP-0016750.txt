<ABSTRACT>
The cross-country ski booth (1) has on its sole (3) lateral downwardly projecting extensions (4), whose clear width substantially the width of the ski (2) entails, so that the ski (2) of the sole of the shoe (1) is transposed in the operating position.the backup of the cross-country ski boot (1) against displacement in the longitudinal direction (5) of the ski (2) is carried out by a pivotable locking member (17), which releases the sole extension (12) of the cross-country ski boot (1) in its aspirated to the ski tip and pivot them forwardIn the operating position, the sole fist set on the surface of the ski sets.For the determination of the cross-country ski booth (1) thus a single pivotable locking element is sufficient.The lateral guidance of the shoe (1) at the ski (2) is ensured by the lateral projections (4) of the sole (3).
