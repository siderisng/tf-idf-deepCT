<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method of making a nut with a  captive, freely rotatable washer, of the kind which is commonly  used for securing a wheel to a commercial vehicle.  in the method according to the invention, the nut and  washer are formed integrally from a single blank (4) preferably  by forging, and are then at least partially separated by a  metal removing operation (such as machining) which leaves  a web of material (8) which, when the nut and washer are  fully separated, is used to retain the washer (10) and nut (9)  together in the desired, freely rotatable condition.  the method of the invention is simpler and less expensive  than known methods and produces a nut and captive  washer having true bearing surfaces.
