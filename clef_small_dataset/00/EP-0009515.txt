<DESCRIPTION>
method of erecting a building structure and building structure erected by the same. the invention relates to a method of erecting a building of prefabricated concrete elements. such a method is known in the known methods a flight of dwellings is frequently assembled in an expensive sequence of setting and transport steps, particularly dwellings erected in highly industrialized countries. if such a building system were used in a country not having a modern infrastructure, the means for assembling the building structure usually do not exhibit the same refinement, whilst in many countries water supply and sewer systems and the like are not provided for up to the houses. the invention particularly relates to a method of erecting very cheap building structures, for example, very cheap dwellings, which can be locally assembled without much cost and which can be readily adapted to modified conditions when utility systems are extended so that the dwellings will be more comfortable. tae method according to the invention is character ized in that at least one table-shaped structural element consisting of a horizontal slab of reinforced concrete supported by legs is deposited at its place zon an underground, after which prefabricated wall elements are placed against this structural element and subsequently secured by their upper edge to said slab. a satisfactory fixation of the building structure with respect to the underground is obtained, when for each leg a concrete foot having a recess is provided in the substrate. in order to erect buildings with reduced risks for the inhabitants, even in regions sensitive to earthquakes, a preferred form of the method is characterized in that the lower end of each leg is arranged in the recess with the interposition of an elastic lining. in order to provide a high rigidity for the building structure a further developed, preferred method is characterized in that at least two contiguous wall elements are tightened together by means of horizontal tightening elements. in order to erect a multi-storey building by using the same basic elements a preferred method according to the invention is characterized in that a multi-storey building is erected by superposing at least one table-shaped structural element on the slab of a previously disposed table-shaped structural element. the invention furthermore provides a building erected by the method according to the invention, in which the reinforced concrete slab is made from light concrete not only to facilitate mounting but also for protection against excessive solar heat or to prevent loss of energy from the dwellings. for the same reasons in a preferred embodiment of the building the wall elements joined to form a wall are also made from light concrete. the above-mentioned and further features of the invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing. in the drawing there is schematically illustrated in: figures 1 and 2 a front view and a side elevation respectively of a building in accordance with the invention, figure 3 a vehicle loading a prefabricated building element at a manufacturing site,

 claims    1. a method of erecting a building of prefabricated concrete elements, characterized in that at least one table-shaped structural element consisting of a horizontal slab of reinforced concrete supported by legs is deposited at its place on an underground, after which prefabricated wall elements are placed against this structural element and subsequently secured by their upper edge to said slab.    2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that for each leg a concrete foot having a recess is provided in the substrate.    3. a method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the lower end of each leg is arranged in the recess with the interposition of an elastic lining.    4. a method as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims, characterized in that the slab is prefabricated on a manufacturing site at a distance from a building site and is transported towards the building site by means of a road  vehicle provided with hoisting means.    5. a method as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that on the manufacturing site reinforced concrete legs are moulded on the slab.    6. a method as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that on the manufacturing site a slab without legs is prefabricated and deposited on legs on the building site.    7. a method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the legs are removed after the wall elements have been put in place.    8. a method as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that at least two contiguous wall elements are tightened together by means of horizontal tightening elements.    9. a method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the legs are formed by metal pipes.     10. a method as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims, characterized in that the slab consists of reinforced, light-weight concrete.    11. a method as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims, characterized in that the wall elements consist of reinforced, light-weight concrete.    12. a method as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims, characterized in that a multi-storey building is erected by superposing at least one table-shaped structural element on the slab of a previously disposed table-shaped structural element.    13. a method as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims, characterized in that an additional roof providing heat insulation is arranged above the slab of a table-shaped structural element.    14. a building erected by the method claimed in anyone of the preceding claims.
