<ABSTRACT>
the combination of a passive dosing dispenser, of the  type having a reservoir containing a cake of active ingredients  which are depleted as water is routed through the dispenser,  and an improved hypochlorite cake for use therein.  the  improved hypochlorite cake provides water-soluble hypoch­ lorites, and additionally contains materials capable of forming  a water-insoluble matrix from which hypochlorite salts may  be leached out by the water in the reservoir.  the size of the  cake desirably increases somewhat while the dispenser is in  use so that the mass of aqueous hypochlorite which may be  poured from the reservoir of the dispenser remains constant  or slightly decreases as the active ingredients are used up.   this improvement levels the delivery of hypochlorite over a  long period of time, and additionally minimizes the amount of  chlorine gas which may be released if the hypochlorite con­ taining solution within the dispenser of the present invention  is inadvertently brought into contact with organic matter such  as waste paper.
