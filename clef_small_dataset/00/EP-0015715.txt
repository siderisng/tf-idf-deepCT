<ABSTRACT>
a method for converting methanol to gasoline which al­ lows for the removal of reaction heat and the conversion of me­ thanol to hydrocarbons to be achieved efficiently is provided.   the dense fluid bed is filled with vertically positioned half-pipe  sections (10) to maintain desired hydraulics and restricted  bubble growth.  provision is made for cooling recycled catalyst  and regenerating a portion of the catalyst used in the system.   in the arrangement of the drawing figure the reactant feed is  charged to a mixing zone (4) of the reactor vessel (2).  the va­ porous product is denuded of catalyst by cyclones (14).  the  catalyst is withdrawn from the reactor vessel (2) and is passed  to a separate catalyst stripping and cooling zone (20).  from  this zone (20) the catalyst is conducted by conduit (36) to the  mixing zone (4).  a portion of the catalyst is regenerated in a  regenerator (42).
