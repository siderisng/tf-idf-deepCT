<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a method of producing a stabilized  photoconducting semiconductor film by electroplating  onto a cathode body.  the film is of amorphous silicon containing  hydrogen.  a solution (16) of a halogenated silane, and/or  silicon halide, in an aprotic solvent containing a tetrabutylammonium  salt is electroysed, in a nitrogen atmosphere,  using a platinum anode (20) and nichrome cathode  (26).  the plated cathode is removed to a nitrogen-containing  chamber (128), and the chamber purged with helium or hydrogen.   cathode (26) is then removed to a heating chamber  (30) and heated in the presence of helium or hydrogen at  above 250°c, preferably 350°c for thirty minutes.  the silicon  film is thereby stabilized chemically and physically.  subsequently,  a pellucid layer of high work function, for example of  platinium, iridium or palladium, can be deposited on the thus  stabilized film to produce a photovoltaic device.
