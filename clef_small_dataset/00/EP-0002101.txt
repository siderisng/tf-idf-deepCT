<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to filter presses of the kind  comprising a plurality of separate filter plates (10) which  are supported by or from a main frame so as to form a stack  at one end of the frame during a filtering operation, and  which are arranged to be moved one by one towards the  opposite end of the frame to enable filter cakes to be removed  from between the plates.  the plates are heavy and tend to stick together, and  known mechanism for moving the plates individually is  either complex and tends to clog with the clay or like  being filtered in ordinary usage, or fails to take account  of the sticktion resulting in the press jamming.  in the invention, the first plate in the stack which is not  to be moved is held in place by a pawl (76) engaged with a  rack (73), and a reciprocating carriage (30) moves across  the gap between the open and unopen plates of the stack,  shutting the pawl (32) and displacing it to engage with the  next plate in the unopen part of the stack and then picking  up the released plate and displacing it to the opened part,  once in each cycle.
