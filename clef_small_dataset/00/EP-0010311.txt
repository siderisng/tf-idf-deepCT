<ABSTRACT>
a paper forming fabric having two layers of synthetic  weft strands (1-8) with interwoven synthetic warp strands  (30-33) and approximately 100% warp fill.  the upper layer of  the fabric comprises a regular array of mesh openings in  which the distance between consecutive openings measured  in the weft direction is never greater than the thickness of a  single warp strand and, measured in the warp direction, is  never greater than the thickness of a single weft strand.

<DESCRIPTION>
paper fopj4ing fabric (a) field of the invention this invention relates to paper forming fabrics for paper making machines and is particularly directed to the pro- vision of an improved duplex forming fabric comprising two layers of synthetic weft strands woven with synthetic warp strands. the invention has particular reference to a paper zorming fabric having two layers of synthetic weft strands with interwoven synthetic warp strands and approximately 100% warp fill, the upper surface of the fabric having a plurality of knuckles formed by said interwoven weft and warp strands being essentially tangent to the plane of the fabric on which be paper is to be formed. whlch (b) description of prior art forming fabrics for paper making machines should provide uniform support for the fibres of the pulp stock so that marking of the formed web of paper by aberrations at the supporting surface will be minimized. the fabrics must be stable in the plane of the cloth, flexible at least in the machine direction, resist stretching, resist wear and at the same time provide su=icient drainage capacity. for many years, forming fabrics were woven of metal strands and while these "wires", as they are called, provided most of the essential requirements, they had a short life span due to failure of the metal strands to resist flexural fatigue, wear and corrosion. further, due to the nature of metal strands the woven wires could be easily damaged and damaged areas were generally not repairable. in recent years, forming wires have been woven of plastic polymeric strands and while these have largely overcome the disadvantages of metal strands insofar as resistance to fatigue, wear, corrosion and inadvertent damage isconcerned, some of the more desirable qualities of the metal strands were lost. for example, difficulties have been experienced wit plastic fabrics that have been woven in the same manner as metal wires, that is, with about 50% warp fill, with respect to dimensional stability, resistance to stretching and also with respect to drainage and fibre support. although many improvements have been made to produce reasonably satisfactory synthetic forming fabric, some of the desireable properties of metal fabrics have still not been regained. recently, synthetic forming fabrics have been woven in duplex weaves having two or more layers of interwoven weft strands and these have prov sed greater dimensional stability and resistance to stretching while maintaining the good wearing and damage resistant qualities of single layer synthetic fabric. duplex fabrics are woven with 100% warp fill or greater and due to the nature of the weave, inevitably have an uneven surface that tends to leave a characteristic and objectionable mark on the surface of the paper. moreover, no amount of stretching during heat setting will alleviate this objectionable sheet marking condition, but, in fact, will generally make it worse. "warp fill" is defined as the amount of warp in a given space relative to the total space considered. for example, 50% warp fill means that 50% of the space in the

we claim:   1. a paper forming fabric having two layers of synthetic  weft strands with interwoven synthetic warp strands  and approximately 100%   warp    fill, the upper surface  of the fabric having a   plurality    of knuckles formed by  said interwoven weft and warp strands being essentially  tangent to the plane of the fabric on which the paper  is to be formed, and characterized in that the upper  layer of the said fabric comprises a regular array of  mesh openings which are spaced apart in the weft  direction by a distance not greater that the thickness  of a single intervening warp strand and in the warp  direction by a distance not greater than the thickness  of a single intervening weft strand.   2. a forming fabric as claimed in claim 1 and characterized  in that said mesh openings re defined by the spacing  between adjacent upper weft strands and by the spacing  between warp strands which are held separated within  the body of the fabric by at least one intervening  warp strand.   3. a forming fabric as claimed in claim 2, and characterized  in that said at least one intervening warp strand is    woven    with lower layer weft strands and extending it  its entire length below said top layer weft strands.   4. a forming fabric as claimed in claim 1 and characterized  in that said weft strands in a lower layer of the said  fabric are duplexed, at the most, under every second  weft strand in said upper layer whereby to allow better  drainage 'throughout the thickness of the fabric.     5. a forming fabric as claimed in claim 3 and characterized  in that said weft strands in a lower layer of the said  fabric are duplexed, at the most, under every second  weft strand in said upper layer, said intervening warp  strand having a shallower crimp than said top   surface     warp strands whereby to stabilize the fabric against  stretching in the machine direction and to increase  knuckle length in a lower surface of said fabric to  increase wear resistance.   6. a forming fabric as claimed in claim 5 and characterized  in that some of said top surface warp strands are  woven with top layer weft strands only.   7. a paper forming fabric having two layers of synthetic  weft strands with interwoven synthetic warp strands and  approximately 100% warp   fill,the    upper surface of said  fabric having a plurality of knuckles defined by positions  at which individual warp and weft strands are tangent  to the plane of the upper surface of the fabric on  which the paper is to be formed the fabric being  characterized in that crossing points between upwardly  and downwardly weaving warp strands are arranged to  lie beneath the upper layer of weft strands whereby  to prevent blockages in the upper layer of the fabric.   8. a paper forming fabric having two layers of synthetic  weft strands with interwoven synthetic warp strands and  approximately 100% warp fill, the upper surface of said  fabric having a plurality of knuckles defined by positions  at which individual warp and weft strands are tangent  to the plane of the upper surface of the fabric on  which the paper is to be formed, the fabric being  characterized in that between any two successive weft  strands in the upper layer at least every otter warp  strand passes beneath both said weft strands.     9. a paper forming fabric in accordance with either of  claims 7 or 8 and characterized in that there are fewer  weft strands in the lower layer than in the upper layer.   10. a paper forming fabric in accordance with any one of the    ,reczeding    claims and characterized in that either the  individual warp strands, or the individual weft strands,  or both types of strands are of a section other than  circular.       11. a    paper forming fabric in accordance with any one of  the preceding claims and characterized in that upper  and   lover    weft strands are of different diameters,  sizes   r    of different materials.   12. a paper forming fabric in accordance with any one of  the preceding claims and characterized in that the warp  strands are of different diameters, sizes or materials  than the weft strands.   13. a paper forming fabric in accordance with any one of  the preceding claims and characterized in that the  upper surface of the fabric belongs to one of the  group comprising: plain weave, three shaft twill, four  shaft twill, or four shaft satin weave.   14. a paper forming machine incorporating or adapted for  use with a paper forming fabric in accordance with any  one of the preceding claims.
