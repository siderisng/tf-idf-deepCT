<ABSTRACT>
two streams of video signals are mixed according to  control words derived from the video signals in at least one  of the streams.  analogue video grey-scale signals generated  by a closed-circuit television system (14) are digitised and  decoded to address a table held in a memory (62) the output  of which is digital colour signals and a control word to define  the mixing operation on the signal.  the control word is  decoded and is interpreted by circuitry (70) controlling the  operation of an arithmetic and logic unit (32).  the second  video signal stream is digital and is likewise used to address  a table held in a memory (24), the output of which is also  digital colour signals.  a control word can also be output from  memory (24).  the alu (32) is capable of and-ing, or-ing,  adding or subtracting the two streams, blocking a selected  one of the streams, or of averaging.  the output of the alu  goes to convention colour crt.
