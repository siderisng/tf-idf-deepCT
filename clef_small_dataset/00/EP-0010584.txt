<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for pressure monitoring, which is particularly useful for use at outside the body circulatory systems, such as. b. Dialysis apparatus, blood cell separators, oxygen devices, and the like in which the internal system pressure must be monitored on one or more places in the bloodstream and corresponding warning signals must be delivered when the pressure is increased or decreased within defined limits. Before commissioning, a pressure measuring cycle must be performed and successfully completed before the main operating cycle of the entire system can begin. A pressure transducer (27) supplies signals to a closed control loop digital system (53, 65, 63, 61), which provides a ge suitable compensation during the start-up or primary cycle and maintains this compensation value during the actual operating cycle. Deviations of the pressure via the lower or upper limit of the stored reference or compensation value causes the operating cycle to be automatically retained.
