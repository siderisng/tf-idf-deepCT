<ABSTRACT>
In a switch arrangement with optionally changeable switch contacts as opener or normally changeable switch contacts are provided for both the opener and the closer function fully equipped switches are provided in which by an insulating part (12), the optional contact between the contacts cooperating as opposed or the non-closing contacts(3, 8, 8 ', 8 ", 8 ‴) is set, each one of the two function types is blocked.To achieve a mechanical, wear-resistant switch arrangement secured against creep streams, the insulating part (12) in both installations in each case outside of the contact points stops (11), which ensure an air spacing between the contact pieces (3.8 ‴) blocked at a contact point.
