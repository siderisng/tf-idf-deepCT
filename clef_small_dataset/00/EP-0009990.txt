<ABSTRACT>
this is a device for filling or topping-up batteries, for  example, an assembly of batteries mounted in a vehicle for  propulsion.  it consists of a trolley (60) including a reservoir  (42) for acid or distilled water, and lines (61) and (62) for  connection to the inlet and the outlet ends (47) and (44) of  a series of filler devices (16) one on each battery cell.  at  the end of the series the line (61) is connected to a sump  (46) on a trolley, and a pump (49) draws liquid from the  reservoir through the filling devices to the sump.  a level  responsive switch (56) in the sump is used for controlling  termination of the filling operation which can be performed  automatically by connecting the lines (61) and (62) and  switching on the equipment.  there is a timer (59) and an  air valve (57) for ensuring that all the liquid is sucked out  of the line after the cells have been filled before the pump  is switched off.  there are automatic connections (70) for  connecting the inlet and outlet (47) and (44) to exhaust  through explosion minimising vents (71) once the lines (61)  and (62) have been disconnected.

<DESCRIPTION>
battery filler this invention relates to a battery filler for filling a number of electric storage battery cells with acid, or topping them up with distilled water from a reservoir, for example,for use with an assembly of electric storage batteries mounted in a vehicle or propulsion of the vehicle. in british patent specification no.2011157a published 4th july, 1979 with a priority date, 23rd december, 1977, there is disclosed such a filler in which a float rises with the liquid level in the cell and carries a dish for collecting incoming liquid for immediate removal to prevent further entry of liquid to the cell when a desired level is reached. the arrangement is simple but not very convenient,and there is no means for knowing when the cell is full. according to the inveniton, a battery filler comprises a reservpir,conduit means for leading fluid from the reservoir to one or more cells having filling devices which prevent further liquid entering the cell when a certain level has been reached,and a pump coupled to the conduit means downstream of the batteries for drawing fluid from the reservoir to the cells. the pump reduces the pressure in the conduits means, and so tends to prevent any loss of acid from the cells through any slight leaks in the conduits. preferably there is a sump in the conduit means between the cells and the pump,in which liquid drawn through, after the cells have all been filled can be collected. the liquid from the sump can eventually be returned to the reservoir by opening a drain valve in a connection from the sump to the reservoir. preferably there is a level responsive switch in the sump arranged to initiate emptying of the conduit means. thus when the level in the sump rises to the level gf the switch,it will be nom that the cells are all full.however,there will still be liquid in the conduit means,and so operation of the pump can continue,for example,for a predetermined interval set on a timer during which time air at'atmosphere pressure may be introduced to the conduit means at the reservoir end in order to displace the excess liquid and drive it into the sump.the pump can then be switched off,and the drain valve opened,and then it can be arranged that a lamp or other indicator shows that the conduits means can be disconnected from the battery. the conduit means can be arranged to be connected to the battery by simple connections,so that after they have been connected,and the equipment has been switched on,it can be left until the indicator shows that filling has been completed, and then the conduits can be simply disconnected. the reservoir,sump,pump and conduit means are conveniently all mounted on a trolley for easy movement from one set of batteries to be filled to another. the emptied liquid can be returned to the reservoir by way of a large pipe having an explosion minimising vent so that gas can escape safely if the unit is inadvertently left

    claims      1.   a.    battery filler comprising a reservoir (42) and conduit means   (44,    61, 50) for leading fluid   Â¯ror.,      the-    reservoir to one or more cells (12)   eacn    having a   filling    device (16)   which.    prevents further licuid entering the cells when a certain level has been reached,   character sec    by a pump   (49)    coupled to the conduit means   downstreair.    of the batteries for   draj;ing    fluid fro the reservoir to the cells.   2. a filler as claimed in claim 1 including a   sump    (46) in the conduit means between the cells and the pump.   3. a filler as claimed in claim 2 including a level-responsive switch (56) in the sump arranged to initiate emptying of the conduit means when the liquid in the sump reaches a predetermined level.   4. a filler as claimed in claim 3 including a normally closed valve (57) in the conduit means upstream of the connection to the cells, but downstream of the reservoir arranged to be opened in response to operation of the level-responsive switch to open the conduit to atmosphere.   5. a filler as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 including a timer (59) arranged to operate a switch (22) a pre-determined time after operation of the levelresponsive switch.     6. a filler as claimed in claim 5 including an indicator (80) responsive to completion of the   predetermined    time, and to the level in the sump being below that necessary to operate the level responsive switch.      5.      k    filler as claimed in any preceding claims, including a stand-pipe (21) leading from the reservoir and into which the outlet from the pump opens and/or   2    drain from the sump to the reservoir opens, the cross-sectional area of the stand pipe being greater than that of the pump outlet   andor    the drain, and an explosion minimising vent (51) on the stand pipe.    8. a filler as claimed in any preceding claim in which the reservoir, conduit means, and pump, are mounted on a trolley (60) which is movable from battery to battery.   9. a battery filler as claimed in any preceding claim connected to a battery merely by way of two conduits, one from the reservoir to a filling device for one cell, and the other from the, or a filling device to the sump, in which the battery has two-way valves (70) normally connecting the filling device or devices to explosion - minimising exhaust vents (71) but arranged automatically to disconnect the exhaust connection when the two conduits are connected to the valves.     10. a method of filling a battery using a filler as claimed in any preceding claim in which the conduit means are connected to the battery and the pump is switched on, and left on until the levelresponsive switch operates.
