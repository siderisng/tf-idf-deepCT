<ABSTRACT>
printing apparatus of the type utilizing flexible, readily  collapsible, imperforate thin metal sleeves wherein the  sleeves are mounted in a device which maintains their  cylindrical configuration rigidified by introduction of fluid  under pressure interior of the sleeve during use.  a method of mounting the sleeve (10) and several  structures for supporting the sleeves are described.  these  include the provision of means in the printing press cooperating  with the sleeves for maintaining its interior pressure  and for stopping the press if the pressure should drop below  a predetermined value.  the sleeves may carry an exterior  coating of flexible, microcrystalline, wholly inorganic photo-conductive  material such as sputtered ultra-pure cadmium  sulfide.

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention is concerned generally with printing apparatus which include cylinders for transferring of pigment to a substrate using electrostatic techniques. the invention is advantageously utilizable in the printing of multicolor images on substrates which are either in long strip form or in the form of sheets of paper, fabric and the like. multicolor printing by conventional presses is a complex process from the point of making the color separations, forming the cylinders, operating the presses, providing the pigment or inks for the separate cylinders or other plates, etc. several developments in recent years have pointed to the use of electrostatic techniques for multicolor printing in printing presses using electrostatic techniques. as known, photoelectrostatic imaging is effected by charging the surface of a photoconductive coating in darkness, exposing the same to a light image, then toning the latent image with fine particles either in powder form or suspended in a solvent. the toned or developed image can either be transferred to a receptor or it can be fused in place directly onto the electrophotographic member of which the photo conductive coating is a part. one of the coatings which has been evolved recently is a high gain, high resolution, easely charged, fully dischargeable, wholly inorganic, microcrystalline photoconductive material which has especially the property that it is rugged and extremely flexible when coated onto a thin flexible substrate. the material is disclosed in u.s. patent 4.025.339. this coating is advantageous in addition to being flexible in that it can be imaged quickly in a high speed press and discharged readily by ambient light so that, as will be explained, it can be provided with an image of toner that is insulating and thereafter charged to apply a charge to the insulating toner while permitting the charge on the untoned areas to be dissipated in light. secondary toner then can be adhered to the primary toned image and transferred to a substrate. thin-walled metal sleeves of electrodeposited nickel, copper, iron or other metal have been used in the fabric and other substrate printing field with success. sleeves of plated metal may be used, such as for example, tin, chromium or other metals as nickel. these sleeves are a fraction of a millimeter thick and can be several meters long and as much as a third of a meter in diameter. they are seamless and are readily supported in printing machines. one type of sleeve is disclosed in u.s. patent 2.287.122. such sleeve is foraminous in order to enable ink or other pigment to be expressed by doctor means through the walls of the cylinders onto the passing substrate. the walls are provided with suitable designs in the surface blocking certain of the holes and leaving others open. for electrostatic use, these sleeves are sputtered with coatings of the photoconductive material which has been mentioned and are imperforate. an important ad vantage of this type of sleeve is that it is light in weight, it is quite strong and is collapsible so that
