<ABSTRACT>
a closed cylindrical pressure chamber is formed in a  casing for mounting on a trailer.  a piston rod (26) carries  a head (33) within the chamber and projects from the casing  at both ends.  passages (38) with restricted orifices (39)  are formed in the head (33) for damping.  bearing support  for the piston rod (26) is provided by tubular portions (21  and 22) of the casing end walls (14 and 15) and by a tube  (23), the head (33) having circumferential bands (40) of  bearing material on either side of its piston ring (37) and  sliding within the bore of the tube (23).  a lip seal (46) and  a scraper seal (48) are located around the piston rod (26)  at the outer end of each end wall tubular portion (21, 22)  to seal the pressure chamber.  hence the three piston rod  bearing supports are located between the sealing means  at each end of the chamber.
