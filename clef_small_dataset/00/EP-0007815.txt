<ABSTRACT>
a process for forming a polymeric solution or gel having  a viscosity of at least about 50,000 cps which includes forming  a solvent system of an organic liquid and a polar consolvent,  the polar consolvent being less than about 15 wt.  % of the  solvent system, the viscosity of the solvent system being less  than about 1,000 cps; dissolving a neutralized sullonated  polymer in the solvent system to form a solution, the concent­ ration of the neutralized sulfonated polymer in the solution  being 0. 1 to 20 wt %, the viscosity of the solution being less  than about 20,000 cps; and adding about 5 to about 500 vol.  %  water to the solution having a viscosity less than aboit 20,000  cps, the water being immiscible with the solution and the  polar cosolvent transferring from the solution phase to the  water phase thereby causing the viscocity of said solution to  increase from legs than 20,000cps to geater than 50,000 cps.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention describes a process which permits (1) the preparation of polymer solutions of sulfon ated polymers in organic liquid having reasonably low viscosities (i.e., less than 20,000 cps), (2)the preparation c'- extremely viscous solutions or geis from s'ch solutions by the simple process of mixing water with the polymer solution and (3) the reversion of such viscous solutions or gels to relatively low viscosity mixtures by the reincorporation of polar cosolvents which are water immiscible at a desired stage. these operations are achieved by the use of the appropriate concentration of polymers having low concentrations of ionic groups present, preferably <rti id=1.9> metal sulfonate groups. such polymers are described in detail in a number of u.s. patents (u.s. 3,836,511; 3,870, 841; 3,847; 3,642, 728; 3,921,021). these polymers possess unusual solution characteristics some of which are descrioed in u.s. patent 3,931,021. specifically such poly mers such as lightly sulfonated polystyrene containing 2 mole % sodium sulfonate pendant to the aromatic groups are typically not soluble in solvente commonly employed for polysyrene itself. however, the incorporation of modest levels of polar cosolvents permit the rapid dissolution of such ionic polymers to form homogeneous solutions of moderate viscosity. in the present process, the role of the polar to solvent is that of solvating the ionic groupe whils the main body of the solvent interacts with the polymer backbone. for examole, xylene is an excellent solveant for the polystyrene backbone and when combined with 5i methanol readily and rapidly will dissolve the previosly described lightly sulfonated polystyrene. a still further object of the invention is to employ the process as an integral part o± well control procedure: with are initiated when unwanted pore fluid influxes have entered the wellbore from subterrancen formati.ons. a thin fluid solution, separated from the water base drilling mud by suitable fluid scacers, could be cir culated don the drill dide string and out through the jet nozzles in the drill bit. udon contacting water in the drill pipe-formation annulus, a viscous gel would be formed that could prevent further pore fluid moverment and avoid the risk of a catastrophic well blowount. this type of proce dure would have several advantages over current, conven tional well control methods hic rely on the hydrostatic gradient of a heavy fluid placed in the annulus to control the well in the event of pore fluid influxes. the present invention relates to a profess for forming 2 polymeric solution having a viscosity of at least 50,000 cps which comprises forming a solvent sys tern of an organic liquid and a polar cosolvent, the polar cosolvent being less than 15 wt. 7ó of the solvent system, theviscosity of the solvent system being less than 1000 cps: dissolving a neutralized sulfonated polymer in the solvent system to for:n a solution, the concentration of the neutral- ized sulfonated polymer in the solution being 0.1 to 20 wt. 7o, wr viscosity of the solution being less than 20,000 cps and adding 5 to 500 vol. z
