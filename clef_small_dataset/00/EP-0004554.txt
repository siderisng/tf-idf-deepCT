<ABSTRACT>
a display system having a scanned crt provides a full  screen layout of alphanumeric characters and at least one  additional screen layout, eg a split screen layout.  a refresh buffer (1) stores data to be displayed in a first  sequence of addresses so that when this data is read out by  address generator (5, 6) in the first sequence a full screen  layout results.  a read only translation store (20) may be  selectively addressed by the first sequence of addresses to  provide a modified sequence of translated addresses.  when  the refresh buffer (1) is addressed by the sequence of  translated addresses a split screen layout of the data results.   a selector (21) is operable to address the refresh buffer (1)  with either the first sequence of addresses or the sequence of  translated addresses.  logic (34, 35, 36) inhibits character display in a blank  area between the two halves of the split screen.  attribute  decode logic (9, 26) enables different attributes to control  screen halves during split screen operation.  read only store (20) is preferably replaced by a read/write  store when several alternative screen layouts are  required.  each alternative screen layout requires a sequence  of translated addresses to be supplied to the read/write store  from a controller.
