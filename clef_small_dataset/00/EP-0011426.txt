<ABSTRACT>
benzopyran- and benzothiopyran-4 -carboxylic acid  aldose reductase inhibitors of the formula:    or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein x is 0,  s, s = o or    n is zero or one; r is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon  atoms; r₁ is hydrogen, chloro, bromo, fluoro or phenyl; r₂  and r₃ when taken individually, are each hydrogen, alkyl of 1  to 3 carbon atoms, chloro, bromo or fluoro; and when taken  together, r₂, r₃ and the carbon atoms to which they are con­ nected form a fused benzene ring; with the proviso that at  least one of r₁, r₂ and r₃ is chloro, bromo or fluoro.  the  compounds are useful in the treatment of diabetic-­ associated complications, such as cataracts, neuropathy or  retinopathy, in a diabetic host.  also disclosed are methods  for preparing the compounds of the formula (i) and their  salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.
