<ABSTRACT>
2-oxo and 2-thioxo-1,3-dithiol compounds of the formula below have a favorable influence on the plant metabolis mus. They selectively promote the formation of separating tissues of fruits and leaves and are suitable for facilitating the harvest of olives and citrus fruits. The compounds correspond to the formula wherein R₁ C₁-C₈ alkyl, optionally single or several times interrupted by oxygen or stitiated by halogen or optionally substituted phenyl or phenoxy sub, C₁-C₈ alkenyl, optionally by halogen SUB, C₃-C₃ alkynyl, C₁- C₆ cycloalkyl, or optionally substituted phenyl, R₂ hydrogen, methyl, C₁-C₈ alkoxycarbonyl or optionally substituted phenyl and x oxygen or sulfur. The preparation of these new compounds is carried out by means of a moderately increased temperature in an inert solvent a 2-propinyl-carboxylic acid ester of the formula R₂-C≡C-COOR₁, wherein R₁ and R₂ have the meaning given under formula I, with a dithiocarbonate or trithiocarbonate The formula reacts, wherein X is oxygen or sulfur and R₃ C₁-C₄ alkylene or benzyl.
