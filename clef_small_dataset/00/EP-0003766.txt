<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new N- (ω-chloroalkanoyl) -n'trifluoromethylphenylutstoffe, multiple methods for their preparation and their use as pesticides. The compounds of the formula in which R and N have the meaning specified in the description are obtained when reacting ω-chloroalkanoylisocyanates with trifluoromethyl anilines in the presence of an inert solution or diluent. There are other manufacturing processes next to it. The active ingredients according to the invention can be used against parasite fungi and bacteria, which affect upper terrace plant parts or attack the plants from the ground and against seed-transmitting pathogens. The active ingredients are particularly suitable for the fight against animal pests, in particular insects in agriculture, in forestry, in stock and material protection as well as on the hygiene sector, are also suitable for combating animal pests, in particular insects.
