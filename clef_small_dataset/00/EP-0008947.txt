<ABSTRACT>
calcined gypsum (stucco) is treated by blending there­ with small portions of water (about 1-10% by eight of the  stucco), allowing it to heal, and grinding the healed stucco to  increase its surface area.  this results in a reduction in water  demand with good retention of set strength.  if the treated  calcined gypsum is not used shortly after the healing proce­ dure, it should be dried before grinding to provide storage  stability.  the reduced water demand is particularly useful in  gypsum board manufacture.
