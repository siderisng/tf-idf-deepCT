<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for winding yarn (10) being  supplied from a constant speed source directly onto a cone  (28) are disclosed.  the yarn passes from the source to the  cone (28) via a storage device (22), and the speed of rotation  of the cone (28) is varied so as to keep the amount of yarn  (10) stored within a predetermined range.  the storage device  (22) includes a drum (23) around which the yarn (10) is  wound tangentially and from which the yarn (10) is removed  axially.  the amount of yarn (10) on the drum (23) is sensed,  and the speed of rotation of the cone (28) varied accordingly.
