<ABSTRACT>
a mechanical press has a self-adjusting device (28) for  automatically setting the position of the mould (20) in the  correct position with respect to the stroke of the press ram  (14).  the device is located between a fixed platen (12) and a  mould carrier (18) and comprises a cylinder (32) having at one  end a stiffly resilient plug (38) which normally covers a valve  port (42) in the cylinder (32); a volume of liquid (40) is located  between a piston (34) in the cylinder (32) and the plug (38).  if  the mould (20) is incorrectly set for the ram stroke (14), the  pressure generated in the liquid so compresses the plug (38)  to expose the port for release of sufficient liquid to re-position  the mould (20).
