<ABSTRACT>
the present invention is directed to an apparatus and  method wherein preprinted rectangular blanks (10a) of  longitudinally stretch-oriented foam sheet material are continuously  formed into cylinders by a tubular forming mandrel(m)  on which the blanks are folded, seamed and  thereafter transferred onto final forming mandrels (fm).   subsequently, the blanks and the final mandrels are heated  to shrink the blanks so that they assume the shape of the  final forming mandrels.  in forming containers, means are  provided to place bottom blanks on the product mandrels  prior to the loading of the cylinders thereon so as to shrink the  cylinders to sidewall shapes overlying the bottom blanks.   the top curl on containers such as drinking cups and food  tubs is formed after shrink forming.  further, the bottom  seam of the container may be reinforced by ironing after  shrink forming.  the bottom blanks are synchronously-fed to  the product mandrels at a compatible spacing and velocity  after being initially blanked from a web at a different spacing  and velocity achieving a minimum amount of scrap in the  web.

<DESCRIPTION>
description of the invention title: method and apparatus for manufacturing foam plastic containers by use of a tubular forming mandrel field of the invention this invention relates to' a method and apparatus for - forming containers by use of a tubular forming mandrel and more particularly, tib a method and apparatus for forming containers from heat-shrinkable material such as foamed plastic sheets and the like. background of the invention it is known in the art to shrink form containers such as drinking cups from preformed tabular lengths of circum terentially oriented thermoplastic material such as fo-amed polystyrene. one particularly desirable method of initially forming a tubular length of such circumferentially oriented material is to provide rectangular-preprinted blanks and wrap these blanks around a mandrel whereon a heat-sealed seam is effected longitudinally along the circumference of the - formed tubular length. the use of rectangular blanks facilitates preprinting of patterns, designs, logos, etc., of the blanks such that the ultimate tubular lengths and containers formed therefrom will bear tiie ultimately desired indicia. a further advantage of the rectangular blank is that it may be cut from an extruded sheet of or thermoplastic moplastic foam which is stretched long:ituínally, i.e:., in the most logical, na-tural and facile direction of stretch after extrusion, namely, the machine direction, to achieve 4 the necessary circumferential orientation in a tubular length or cylinder formed from the rectangular blank. previous efforts to handle these rectangular blanks and form them into cylinders,, however, have required relatively elaborate systems of transfer rollers, turrets with multiple mandrels thereon and vacuum systems to properly index leading and/or trailing edges of the rectangular blanks. on the transfer rollers or mandrels. it is extremely important in the manufacturing of disposable containers to maximize use of the container material. the bottom of a container is usually severed from a continuous web, thus incurring waste in the area of the continuo#,# web between the severed blanks. to maximize the use of the container material it is extremely essential that the bottom blanks be severed ix close proximity to each other along the length of the eon- tinuous bottom blank web. further, the cylindrical blanks which define the sidewalls of the container must also be severed from a second supply of material in such a mao per to maximize use (#f -the container material. apparatus for cutting and transferring bottom blanks from -a continuous web should continuously transfer the severed bottom blank to the final forming mandrel or other work station at which the blank is to be utilized and at the same time minimize the waste of the bottom blank material web. final forming mandrels utilized in the constructicn of disposable cups, for example, may be positioned along an endless glain and spaced from each other by a substantiml distance. to minimize the waste of the bottom blank material web it is essential that the bottom blanks be severed in close proximity to each other. this gives rise to incompatible parametcrs, naillely, a minimum spacing

   ejecting    each said finished cylindrical blank from said mandrel at said second predetermined rate subse- quent to sealing said side seam; ;  transferring said cylindrical blanks from the end of said   mandrel' synchronously    onto individual   final"forming,    mandrels having a shape corresponding to that of   the    side-   wall    of a desired container   configuration;     placing a bottom portion of plastic sheet material on said final forming mandrels prior to   shrinking    said   cylindrical 'blanks;       shrinking    said blanks onto said final   forming    mandrels and over at least the peripheral   portion--of    said bottom   #portion;     sealing the overlapped areas of said blank and said bottom portion to provide a closed bottom seam;  and  ejecting said container from said final forming, mandrel.        44.    the   method    defined in   claim,      ,    including the    further    step of forming annular rim   configurations    at   tiie     ends of said sidewalls to define mouths, for said containers - 45. the method of forming a cylindrical blank from a    rectangular blank of foam plastic sheet ikaterinl 1 comprising     providing a rectangular blank of a width   substall-     tially equal to the desired length of a cylindrical blank  and a length substantially equal to the desired circum  ference; ;  conveying said rectangular blank in a direction  parallel to its width dimension along the   length    of a fixed  cylindrical mandrel and continuously and progressively  applying heat to the edges of said blank along the width at    indivudually    selected temperatures   peculia    to each of said  edges and folding said edges of said   rectallx,gular    blank upon  themselves   on, said" mandrel    while conveying said blank to  form a cylindrical blank   with    a lapped side   seam;    and  progressively compressing said side seam on  said mandrel to heat-seal said lapped ends together.    46. the method of   forming    heat-shrinkable cylindrical  blanks   from    longitudinally oriented rolled ¯lengths of foam  plastic sheet material and heat   shrinking    said blanks to  a predetermined cross-sectional configuration comprising:  :  feeding said lengths from a roll and cutting same  into like rectangular blanks having said orientation in  the longitudinal direction thereof;  conveying said blanks at a first predetermined  rate transversely of said longitudinal direction while  progressively folding and advancing said blanks about and  along an elongated cylindrical mandrel until the ends of  said blanks overlap on said mandrel, to form   cyliiidrical     blanks each having a longitudinal sid#e seam defined by  said overlap and with said#orientation directed circum    ferentially    of each said blank;       ap,,qlyin-g    heat at a selected temperature to   each    of said ends of said blank during the   advancement      thereof    along .said mandrel; ;  applying pressure   along    said heated overlapped  ends to seal   said    side seam and complete each said cylindrical blank on said mandrel   while    conveying said blanks at a second faster predetermined rate;  ejecting said finished cylindrical blank from  said mandrel at said second   thredetermined    rate subsequent to sealing said side seam;  transferring said cylindrical'blank from the end of said mandrel synchronously onto individual final forming mandrels having the desired cross-sectional configuration; and  shrinking said cylindrical blanks to the shape of said final forming mandrels.     47. the method of claim 41, wherein said shinking of said cylindrical blank comprises continuously transporting said final forming mandrels through a zone of elevated temperature sufficient to shrink said blanks to theconfiguration of said final forming mandrels during the time of transport through said zone.    48. the method defined in any one of claims 42 - 47,   wherein    said blank includes printed graphics on one face  thereof including the step of orienting said blank such  that said graphics appear on the outer circumferences of  said cylindrical blank.
