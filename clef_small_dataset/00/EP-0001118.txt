<ABSTRACT>
an electric contact device for conveying electric current  to an article (w) such as a moving billet or wire comprises a  current feeder member in a fluidised bed (20) of electrically  conductive particles (19) and the article (w) being placed in  contact with the fluidised bed (20).  the particles (19) may be  copper particles which have been de-oxidised and the bed  maintained in a non-oxidising atomsphere.  two contact  devices 10 may be provided at spaced positions to cause a  current flow along the article (w).  the contact device 10 may  operate as a switch by providing means to move the article  into and out of the fluidised bed.
