<ABSTRACT>
bottle handling apparatus receives bottles from a dis­ penser to a first transport region (34) between two parallel  conveyor belts (such as 38) which grip the bottle between  them.  the bottles are arranged in a random sequence of  top-leading and top-trailing bottles.  bottles are transferred  from the first transport region (34) to a second transport  region (36) in the form of two further parallel conveyor belts  (such as 86) overlapping and located beneath the first  transport region.  the belts in the second transport region  grip the bottles more firmly than those in the first transport  region, taking over control of the bottles and accelerating  them away from the first transport region.  from the second  transparent region the bottles are delivered to a discharge  wheel (32).  in the transition zone between the first and  second transport regions means are provided for changing  the disposition of top-leading bottles to a top-trailing disposi­ tion, while not interfering with the position of bottles already  in the top-trailing position.  in one embodiment the means  includes a hook (158) engaging the open leading end and  holding the bottle so that the bottle pivots around the hook  under the action of the belts to reverse the disposition of the  bottles.  in a second embodiment the bottle is engaged by  cam surfaces which have the effect of turning any bottles in  top-end leading disposition to an top-end trailing disposi­ tion.
