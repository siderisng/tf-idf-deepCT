<ABSTRACT>
The safety device for plants with free in the room moving parts, in particular handling counters (industrial robots) and driverless transport vehicles, contains switching means, which can be used in collision of the moving parts with persons or devices (objects) a control signal that stops or a moving parts Emergency run program starts, which z. b. a sequence of movement opposite the collision. As a switching means, an initially electrically insulating, in compressive stress but electrically conductive plastic layer (4), which is mounted between two electrode layers (3,3 ') attached to the places of the moving parts, which due to their shape and kinetic energy at collisio nen a danger represent. By a further elastic or plastically deformable layer (8) which may be arranged between the switching means and the moving parts, it is achieved that the switching point is laid as far as possible in the direction of movement of the parts to the front, before it is to a direct contact of the hard machine parts With the object comes and that the force resulting from the kinetic energy effect is acting in a large area as possible. Part of the kinetic energy is in non-harmful energy gap men, z. b. Deformation work, converted. The switching means may also be divided into individual blocks with smaller dimensions, which are applied side by side to the surface of the moving parts and connected in parallel.
