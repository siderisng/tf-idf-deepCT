<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an airport monitoring system for determining the airfield position and the identifier of aircraft (4) using secondary radar with an ABFRA gestation (1) arranged at the airfield (3), from which the query signal via a sharing bundle, the airfield Sampling antenna is emitted, and in the aircraft (4) attached response stations. Well-known airport monitoring systems working with secondary radar are either too inaccurate or areas occur in which no localization is possible. These difficulties are avoided according to the invention by the use of a spatially deposited from the query antenna (1) receptive antenna (21), which is intercepted by a narrow, also a scanning movement, the transponder responses of the aircraft (4) EMP captures which each in each case the airfield (3) sampling section field (27) of the query and receive legs (2,22) are located. Instead of or in addition to the reception tion (21) with the narrow antenna lobe (22), several receivers (5, 6, 7) can be placed with round-jet receiving antennas on the airfield edge, so that the principle of hyperbel locating is determined to determine the aircraft positions. Application can be applied. The airport according to the invention monitoring system is suitable as an addition to Landesy Memen or even for itself as equipment in particular for larger airfields.
