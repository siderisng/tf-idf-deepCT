<ABSTRACT>
arrangements for the attachment of a boom (9) to an  agricultural vehicle (1), the boom being pivoted at one end  on the vehicle and having a supporting wheel (11) at its free  end are shown.  arrangements are made for driving the  boom into one of two working positions in which it projects  respectively from one or other side of the vehicle.  such  arrangements include, for example, a driving control cable  (19) between the vehicle and the boom, the cable being  loaded by the action of a hydraulic ram (16) to tension the  cable and pull the boom into either of its working positions.   the ram acts on an intermediate member (51) which is  preferably positioned and pivoted to provide a component of  lifting force to the boom during its movement.  provision is  also made to enable the supporting wheel to be steered by  the operator of the vehicle.  the apparatus is adaptable for  distribution of liquid and dry chemicals and also for seed  distribution.
