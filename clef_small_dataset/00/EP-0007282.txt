<ABSTRACT>
A method of veneer of a strip of a metal having a melting point and a mechanical strength higher than the aluminum on one side at least of an aluminum strip by continuous casting between cylinders by means of a nozzle,The platen tape being interposed between the cylinders and the cast aluminum.The veneer metal strip is in contact with the cylinder at least on the portion between the generator closest to the end of the nozzle and the one in the plane of the cylinders axes.The game between the nozzle and the plating band applied against the cylinder is less than 1 mm and the exhalation of the veneer metal is greater than 1% and less than that of the solidified aluminum.Application to the manufacture of aluminated composite bands Nium - copper or aluminum-stainless steel.
