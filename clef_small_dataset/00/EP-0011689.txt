<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a conventional seam with the aid of a zig-zag sewing machine. After forming a first encryption (1) of needle and gripper thread in a first overstacking position (I) of the needle rod (22), the needle thread (NF) is loosened and the needle bar (22) moves into a second overstacking position (II), in which takes place another thread clip (2). After the formation of at least one straight stitch in the second overstacking position, the connection thread between the two first thread loops under bil tion of a loop (S) in the first excite layer (I) extend, the needle (26) stands in the loop (S) What this is released. The seam formed thereby is a fixed connection seam, through which the sewing material between the thread clings is not contracted. The method is carried out on a device which contains an overall mandally, to achieve two consecutive movement phases in the pendulum pathway of the needle rod (22) and a start-up bar (47 and 48 and 48, respectively ) is assigned and a loop wiper (51) protrudes in its videos. The needle bar thus controls undressing and discarding the connecting thread between the first two thread closures.
