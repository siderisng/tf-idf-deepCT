<ABSTRACT>
a chitin derivative obtained by acylation of a de-n-­ acetylated and etherified chitin represented by the formula:   [c₆h₈o₃ .  (nh₂)x .  (nhcoch₃)y .  (or)a .  (oh)b]n   wherein r represents at least one group selected from a  carboxyalkyl group with two to four carbon atoms, a hydrox­ yethyl group, a hydroxypropyl group, a dihydroxypropyl  group or an alkyl group with one to three carbon atoms, x is a  number of 0. 1 to 1. 0, y = 1. 0 - x, a is a number of 0. 1 to 1. 0, and  b = 1. 0 - a.    or a salt thereof can form at least the outer surface of a  material.  this chitin derivative is insoluble in water, acids,  alkaline solutions and organic solvents.  the materials com­ prising the chitin derivative can be employed to seprate mat­ erials on a column, as a base material on which enzymes are  immobilized, as a dialysis membrane and as an adsorbent.
