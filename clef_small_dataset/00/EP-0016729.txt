<ABSTRACT>
substituted N- (p-aminophenyl) -n'-benzoylurreas of the formula wherein R¹ and R² independently of each other C₁-C₄-alkyl or C₃-C₅ alkenyl;R³ and R⁴ independently of each other chlorine or bromine;R⁵ and R⁶ are independently hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine, with the mass that the radicals R⁵ and R⁶ are not both at the same time hydrogen, driving for the preparation of these compounds as well as these relevant means for use in the pestic bombing, in particular for combating plantsand animals infested insects.The compounds have Füh's shemendous effect and especially high ovolarvicides and ovicide effectiveness against plant-damaging insects.Compounds of the formula wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ have the above meanings and wherein at least one of the radicals R¹ and R² is C3-C5 alkenyl.
