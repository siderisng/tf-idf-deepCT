<ABSTRACT>
methods and apparatus for encoding electrical signals  for transmission in a narrow frequency band or at a low bit  rate are described together with methods and apparatus for  constructing signals from encoded signals.  a succession of  first signals representing the durations of sub-divisions, for  example, half cycles of the signal to be encoded are  generated as is a succession of second signals representing  the shape of the sub-divisions.  each pair of first and second  signals may then be replaced by one of a limited number of  symbols.  after an operation such as transmission to a  remote location, or removal or addition of symbols, the  symbols are translated back into first and second signals.   whether transmitted or from a store, the first and second  signals are used to construct analogue signals having  sub-divisions of duration derived from the first signals and  shapes derived from the second signals.
