<ABSTRACT>
Circuit arrangement for a voice-controlled speaking station in telecommunications, in particular telephon systems with channel-specific amplifiers and with a speech direction detection circuit which controls damping members in both channels, which in the channel with the higher speech voltage reduces the attenuation and in the channelWith the lower speech voltage, the attenuation is increased accordingly.The signal voltages derived from the microphone and speaker voltages are supplied to the rectifier arrangements via opera tension amplifiers.As a result, the threshold voltage of the rectifier dio is practically eliminated, so that strong control variations can be better dominated on the connecting lines.
