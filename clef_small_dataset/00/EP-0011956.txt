<ABSTRACT>
a flow responsive device (10) for use in a fluid flow system  to establish a signal when a predetermined flow rate is  attained within a flow conduit.  the device (10) is adapted for  connection to a flow conduit (12) and has a target vane (26)  adapted for insertion within the flow conduit for movement in  response to predetermined flow to open internal valve means  (24) against the bias force of a compression spring (34) and  control pressure within a pressure chamber (16).  in operation,  the control pressure is maintained at a higher pressure than  the fluid pressure within the flow conduit (12) so that after  initial opening of the valve means (24), the control pressure  drops and the valve means undergoes fast-action movement  to its fully open condition.  the flow rate at which the valve  means (24) closes is less than the flow rate at which the valve  means (24) opens so that hunting of the valve means during  operation is prevented.  the pressure chamber (16) may be  connected to a control line (18) having a flow restrictor therein  so that when the valve means is opened, a pressure drop  across the flow restrictor establishes a signal which may be  employed to control external equipment.
