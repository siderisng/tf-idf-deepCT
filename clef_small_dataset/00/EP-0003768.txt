<ABSTRACT>
the paper is metallised by introducing it into a colloidal palladium solution containing acidic tin(ii) ions in excess and treating the thus activated material with an acid or alkali and then electrolessly coating it with metal in a basic metal salt solution.  the metallised paper has a surface resistance at 50% relative humidity and 23 deg c, measured in accordance with din 54 345, of not more than 1 x 10<3> ohm when the metal coat has a thickness of 0. 11  mu m and not more than 3 x 10<1> ohm when the metal coat has a thickness of 0. 17  mu m.
