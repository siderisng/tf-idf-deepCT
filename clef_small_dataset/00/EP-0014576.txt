<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for determining the bulk density of radioactive  nuclear fuel particles flowing in a process stream.  a carrier  (20) having a known weight and a cavity (22) of known volume  is movable between the flowing particle stream and a weigh  cell (26).  the carrier (20) and selected portions of the cell (26)  and carrier transporter are enclosed within a sealed structure  (32) to contain the radioactive material.  after density  determination, the particle sample is dumped, preferably  back into the flowing stream, by structure which rotates the  carrier (20) or opens a door at the bottom of the cavity (22).
