<ABSTRACT>
a lubricant composition is provided comprising a major  amount by weight of a lubricant having dispersed therein a  minor amount by weight of added abrasive particles having a  hardness on the mohs scale of at least 9, the abrasive particles  having a size distribution such that the average particle size is  less than 2 microns and the maximum particle size is less than  3 microns.  when used as a lubricant for, for example vehicle  engines and gear boxes, substantial economies in fuel conÂ­ sumption are obtainable.

<DESCRIPTION>
lubricant composition, method for its production, lubricant additive and method of using the lubricant composition this invention relates to lubricant compositions to methods for their production, to lubricant additives and to methods of using the lubricant compositions. the presence of hard abrasive particles in a lubricant is generally considered to be undesirable since their presence may result in damage to the surfaces to be lubricated. thus it is conventional to include an oil filter in the path of the circulating lubricant in an internal combustion engine to remove such particles. french patent specification no. 977,834 describes the addition to a lubricant base of from 1 to 10% by weight of powdered, relatively soft minerals such as colcothar (polishing rouge or english rouge) aluminium, aluminium oxide or the silicaceous material known as "tripoli". it is stated that the lubricant composition so formed can reduce the running-in period of a vehicle and can help maintain fluid friction between relatively moving surfaces. the particle sizes of the added mineral is not specified other than by indicating that it is less than the thickness of the lubricant film between the surfaces to be lubricated. lubricants have been incorporated in compositions containing abrasive particles which are intended for use in cutting and grinding metals. for example russian patent specification no. 345,187 discloses a lubricating-cutting liquid for cutting copper and its alloys to which is added calcium oleate, kerosine and abrasive powder. neither the particle size nor the hardness of the abrasive is specified. similarly u.s. patent specification no. 3,078,227 discloses a cutting and grinding composition comprising molybdenum disulphide, various waxes and an abrasive and u s patent specification no. 2,157,379 discloses a lubricant to which is added hydrogenated castor oil wax, gel particles, and finely divided sulphur. this medium can be used to suspend particles of emery, carborundum, rouge or whiting to form grinding, lapping and polishing mixtures. the particle size of the abrasives is not given. u s patent specification no. 3,399,145 discloses a dispersion of finely divided boron in mineral oil for use as an electroviscous fluid, but there is no mention of the use of the fluid as a lubricant. also boron is not considered to be an abrasive. u s patent specifications nos. 3,213,024, 3,196,109, 3,658,709 and 2,980,475 disclose grease formulations comprising boron nitride. the boron nitride used in these specifications would be the hexagonal form, which is greasy (like graphite) and is not an abrasive. it has now surprisingly been found that the addition to a lubricant of a minor amount of suitably finely divided particles of selected abrasives of a sufficient degree of hardness and having a precisely characterised size distribution has a beneficial effect on surfaces lubricated therewith, particularly when the resulting lubricant composition is used for lubricating during the "bedding in" of such surfaces, such as occurs for example to moving parts of vehicles during the running in period of the motor vehicle. according to the present invention there is provided a lubricant composition comprising a major
