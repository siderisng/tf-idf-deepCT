<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for measuring current drain  and other circuit parameters, particularly in vehicular electriÂ­ cal systems, the apparatus utilizing a reference current  source (80,82) passed through a commonly available system  element (8) (the battery ground strap in an automobile) to  calibrate a visual indicator (66) in the circuit (14,20,18,38,66)  for the particular system being tested.  readings of electrical  values can then be made for various parts of the system  under test.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: method and apparatus for testing electrical circuits. this invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for testing electrical circuits. more particularly, but not exclusively, it relates to a method and apparatus useful for measuring electrical values in vehicular electrical systems. vehicular electrical systems utilize a battery and an alternator or generator as sources for the energy required. ground for such systems is usually provided by connecting the negative battery terminal to a metallic portion of the vehicle through a socalled battery strap. this strap is a conductor of some size as the current flow in the system may be substantial, particularly when the vehicle engine is being started. various types of circuits have been provided for testing these circuits. one such circuit with which the applicant is familiar is connected to the system by removing the battery ground strap and connecting a shunt of known resistance in series. a current drain is caused by creating a load and the voltage drop across the shunt is then used to calibrate the test circuit. another known method is the "substitution method" in which connections are made to the battery post and a voltmeter. a load such as the starter is energized and the battery terminal voltage read. a dummy variable load within the tester is then connected across the battery. the circuit with the dummy load includes an ammeter. the dummy load is adjusted until the voltmeter reads the value as that previously read when the starter was energized. at this point there is supposed to be at least an approximation of the current drain as indicated on the ammeter when the starter was energized other elements of the electrical system are tested in the same way. b third technique uses a sensor such as a hall effect device which is responsive to a magnetic field such as would be created by current flow in a conductor. the sensor is brought to the vicinity of the conductor and produces a signal proportional to the current flow therein. these devices and their associated circuitry are relatively costly. the applicant's knowledge of and experience with the foregoing methods and apparatus has led him to the conclusion that they are unstable or inaccurate or depend much upon the skill of the operator. in addition they are relatively costly to make: therefore this invention seeks to provide in an embodiment a novel electrical test apparatus which is reliable and accurate. this invention also seeks to provide in an embodiment a novel electrical test apparatus which is relatively easy to use because it may be quickly connected to an electrical system to be tested and does not require that any of the elements of the system be themselves disconnected. this invention further seeks to provide an embodi ment which utilizes standard electrical components, including readily available solid state components, and which therefore is relatively inexpensive to manl- facture, and in addition, maz be constructed as an easily transported instrumen, according to a first aspect of
