<ABSTRACT>
an improved process employing yeast for the production  of oils is described.  yeast is cultivated in a medium  containing a carbon nutrient source of one or more fatty  acids having between 10 and 20 carbons.  these fatty acids  provide a means for improving the yield of synthesized oil  and for controlling their glyceryl ester composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the microbiological production of oil the supply of naturall*-occurring glyceryl-ester oils (by which term it is meant also to include fats) is commonly subject to periods of scarcity which may elevate prices and/or disturb various segments of industry. in addition, the limited variety of such oils rcstricts their usefulness for many practices. it is therefore understandable that alternative supplies, sources and types of such oils have been investigated extensively. one of the more promising of these alternatives involves the cultivation of oil-synthesizing microorganisms. many microorganisms -- including algae, bacteria, molds and yeasts -which can synthcsize oil in the ordinary course of cellular metabolism have been found. the basic process steps for this neans of producing oils are simple and uniform. all that is rcquired is that the microorganism be cultivated in a suitable culture medium to allow synthesis of the oil, then separated from the medium and treated for recovery of its intracellular content of oil. it is within the framework of these basic steps that most investigation has taken place. in particular, researchers have concentrated on secking to identify the combinations of specific microorganisms, media, and conditions which would permit economically practicable oil production. despite extensive efforts, however, the most crucial deficiencies of microbiological oil production have remained. with few exceptions, microorganisms have produced dissappointing low yields of oil. even the most successful microorganisms, for example, seldom reached oil contents of as much as 40% zy dry cell weight and the great majority had substantially lower yields. this fact, coupled with the difficulties of recovering the intracellularly stored oil, made the cost of this approach generally prohibitive. the drawbacks imposed by low yields, however, are further compounded by the inability to exert adequate control over the composition of the oil synthesized. if, for example, cercain of the known specialty oils or improved oils could be produced, the higher prices they could command might provide commercial justification for this approach. thus far, however, no such general means of control has been discovered. in accordance with the present invention, it is possible doth to improve the yield of oil synthesized by a microorganism and to exert substantial control over the chemical composition of that oil. by thus permitting high yields of preselected oils of particular importance, this invention renders the microbiological production of oils a commercial practicality. in its most general embodiment, this invention involves the discovery that the aerobic synthesis of oils by yeasts may be controlled by using certain fatty acids as the carbon nutrient source of their culture or fermentation media. these fatty acids, which have between 10 and 20 carbons, may act individually or collectively to increase oil yield and to cause synthesis of oil having a particular, preselected composition. in additional embodiments, various preferred media ingredients and cultivation conditions are described. these optional modes of carrying the process of this invention have been found to complement -- and thus still further improve --the yields and control imparted by the present fatty acids. the microorganisms
