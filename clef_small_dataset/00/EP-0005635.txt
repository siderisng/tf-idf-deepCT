<ABSTRACT>
a resilient handle for carrying a tool head (9) formed  with a waisted handle-receiving eye (8) said handle comprising  at least three parallel laterally spaced rods (2) embedded  and bonded in a body of moulded resilient material (1) to  form the handle, the said resilient body terminating short of  the ends of the rods at one end of the handle so as to enable  the end regions of the rods to be resiliently displaced  towards one another for passage through the waist (7) of the  head eye, and those end regions of the rods having lateral  enlargements (10) for engagement with the side wall (11) of  the said eye to hold the head on the handle when the said  end regions of the rods have been so passed through the  waist of the eye.
