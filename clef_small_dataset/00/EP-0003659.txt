<ABSTRACT>
the present invention is an ion-electron analyzer consisting in effect of an ion microphobe analyzer and an electron diffractometer which are accommodated in a single housing (5).  an electron probe and a negative ion beam are produced simultaneously from the same source (1) of charged particles, and simultaneously bombard the surface of a specimen (6).  a mass-spectrograph (7, 8, 9) analyses the secondary ions produced, and a fluorescent screen (13, 14) forms a diffraction pattern from the reflected electrons.  in this way one can avoid the disadvantages of the previous separate devices, namely that the specimen is partly destroyed by the ion bombardment so that electron diffraction analysis cannot be performed on the same spot on the specimen and that it is difficult and inconvenient to move the specimen from one device to another.
