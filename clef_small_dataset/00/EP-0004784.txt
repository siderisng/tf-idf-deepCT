<ABSTRACT>
in a connector for interconnecting a furcated lead (10)  and signal generator (16) to form a body implantable  stimulator, the connector (17) is secured to the signal  generator to form a signal generator assembly.  jacks (26, 30)  are provided in the connector to receive the lead furculae  while facilitating conformance of furculae to the configuration  of the signal generator on wrapping of the furculae  around the signal generator (16).  the jacks (26, 30) accept the  furculae at different distances from the signal generator to  allow a thinner signal generator assembly and at different  depths to compensate for the difference in distance of the  jacks (26, 30) from the signal generator (16).  in this way the  hitherto encountered problem of fibrosis caused by the  excess length of furculae is greatly reduced.
