<ABSTRACT>
disclosed are haloaryl halobenzene sulfonates of the  formula    wherein x and x′ are each independently selected halogen,  preferably chlorine or bromine; n is an integer of  from 1 to 5 and m is an integer from 1 to 4, provided that  the sum of n plus m is an integer of from 4 to 9; and r  is selected from hydrogen, halogen (preferably chlorine  and bromine), and    wherein y and y′ are each independently selected halogen,  preferably chlorine and bromine, m′ is an integer from  1 to 4 and n′ is an integer of from 1 to 5, providet that  m′ + n′ is from 4 to 9 and z is an alkylene or alkylidene  containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.  also disclosed are  processes for their production and polymeric compositions  containing these compounds as flame retardants.
