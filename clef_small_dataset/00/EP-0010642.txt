<ABSTRACT>
1.  a jumping apparatus in the form of a trampoline comprising a closed frame (1 and 2) with side elements (1) extending lengthwise and end elements (2) extending crosswise, with a jumping sheet (7) stretched with a clearance all round within the frame elements (1 and 2) by tensioning elements (8-11), more particularly springs or other elastic elements, and having bow shaped supports (3 and 4) to hold up the frame, whereby the frame side elements (1) are capable of being hinged at least once in such a manner that the required area of the jumping sheet (7) can be sloped from the horizontal, characterized by the end elements (2) of the frame being so joined to the side elements (1) at the level of the useable jumping sheet that they can be rotated around their lengthwise axis and by each end element (1) of the frame having a crank-shaped bend (a) directed towards the jumping sheet (7), to which the tensioning elements (8-10) of the adjacent end of the jumping sheet (7) are secured.
