<ABSTRACT>
a apparatus comprising a parallel coil (15) and a capaci­ tance (c2), the coil (15) having an air gap in which an unknown  specimen is inserted, a source of alternating voltage applied  to the coil-capacitance combination (15, d2), scanning means  (e. g.  20) for automatically varying the value of the capacitance  in steps, thus varying the phase of the voltage across the coil  (15), means (22) for digitizing the phase of the voltage corres­ ponding to each capacitance value, a memory (31) in which  those digitized phase values are stored, a reference memory  (29 or 30) containing digitized phase values for known speci­ mens, and means (26) for comparing the digitized phase val­ ues of the unknown specimen with those of known speci­ mens.  a digital tolerance control circuit (14) is also provided  which accomodates deviations between the reference and the  known phase values, up to predetermined amounts, and  means (33) are provided for displaying the generic name or  grade of the stored phase values which match the phase  values of the unknown specimen.
