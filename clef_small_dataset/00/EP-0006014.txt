a drinking cup of the kind adapted to be nested in a stack  of identical cups contains a measured dose of beverage  concentrate (5), which is retained within the cup as a  coherent mass by being compressed within the cup in such a  manner that the coherent mass interlocks with recesses (3)  within the cup.  the cup incorporates a stacking ledge to  support an upper cup nested therein out of contact with said  mass of concentrate.
