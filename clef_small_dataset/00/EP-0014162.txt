<ABSTRACT>
in this track section, the conducting blades 1b placed edgeways in a plate 2 forming the "roadway" are connected electrically and mechanically to the corresponding blades of the adjacent sections by snap-fastening means comprising, on the one hand, a notch 8 and, on the other hand, an elastic portion 17, 18, 19 catching into this notch.  these snap-fastening means are covered by a covering portion 10 of the plate 2 which covers the join between the blades and provides continuity of the "roadway" of the track formed by assembled sections.  <image>
