<ABSTRACT>
this improved cartridge-type pivotal pin and bushing  joint comprises a cylindrical pin (10) having a large, hollow  metal cylinder (12) concentrically disposed thereon inter­ mediate the extremities thereof and a plurality of preloaded,  spaced, dry, self-lubricated cylindrical bushings (14) between  the pin and cylinder at least adjacent the extremities of the  cylinder.  dry, self-lubricated annular thrust bearings (16) are  concentrically mounted on the pin adjacent the extremities  of the cylinder and thrust-controlling annular retainers (18)  are immovably press-fitted on the pin axially exterior to and  abutting the thrust bearings so as to compressibl-preload the  same.  the retainers (18) have rounded or chamfered edges  to facilitate press-fitting, and seal-receiving annular grooves  (20) are provided radially outwardly of the outer radial  extremity of the thrust bearings, the open end of each of the  grooves being disposed towards the end of the cylinder.   resilient seals (22) are disposed in the grooves to sealingly  engaged end portions of the cylinder.  the self-lubricated  cylindrical bushings (14) may be metal-backed and the  reatiners (18) may be manufactured with wall portions form­ ing a primary seal.
