<ABSTRACT>
a periscopic sight (11, 13, 14) is mounted to extend  through the wall of protective armour (23) surrounding a  gun station.  an elevation mirror (11) is exposed to receive  light from the direction in which the gun is pointing and to  reflect the light along a vertical path extending through the  sight.  a sealed unitary lens system (13) has a lens axis  aligned with the vertical path and conducts the light thereÂ­ through to a stationary mirror (14) accessible to the eye  (16) of an observer.  the sealed unitary lens systems has a sufficiently long  eye relief to provide an unobstructed image to the observer  in spite of the placement of the stationary mirror (14)  between the lens system (13) and the observer (16).
