<ABSTRACT>
a liquid developer for developing electrostatic images  comprises a dispersion in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent of  particles of imaging material, binder and polymeric carba­ mate having a linear carbon backbone and carbamate side  chains in which the carbamate groups contain at least one  alkyl group having at least 5 carbon atoms carried by the  nitrogen atom thereof, the binder and the polymeric carba­ mate are soluble in the hydrocarbon solvent when hot and  insoluble in the hydrocarbon solvent at room temperature so  as to be present in co-precipitated form in the developer.
