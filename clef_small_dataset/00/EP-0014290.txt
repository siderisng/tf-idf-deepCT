<ABSTRACT>
a valve assembly especially for a breathing apparatus  comprises a housing 14, an inlet for admitting gas into the  housing from a source of gas at a superatmospheric pressure,  a movable valve member 21 which is capable of closing the  gas inlet and which, in operation, is acted upon, at least when  ist is closed or nearly closed, by a force resulting from the  pressure difference between the higher pressure gas  upstream of the inlet and the lower pressure gas in the hous­ ing 14, the effect of which force is to tend to move the valve  member 21 to open the gas inlet, and means 16 responsive to  the difference between the pressure in the housing 14 and the  ambient pressure, the pressure-responsive means 16 being  so connected to the valve member 21 that, if the pressure in  the housing 14 exceeds the ambient pressure, at least by a  certain amount, the pressure. responsive means 16 exerts a  force on the valve member 21 which tends to cause the valve  member to move to close the inlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in and relating to valves the present invention relates to valve assemblies, and especially to demand valves for controlling the flow of pressurised respirable gas to breathing apparatus. the present invention provides a valve assembly which comprises a housing, an inlet for admitting gas into the housing from a source of gas at a superatmospheric pressure, a movable valve member which is capable of closing the gas inlet and which, in operation, is acted upon, at least when it is closed or nearly closed, by a force resulting from the pressure difference between the higher pressure gas upstream of the inlet and the lower pressure gas in the housing, the effect of which force is to tend to move the valve member to open the gas inlet, and means responsive to the difference between the pressure in the housing and the ambient pressure, the pressure-responsive means being so connected to the valve member that, if the pressure in the housing exceeds the ambient pressure, at least by a certain amount. the pressure responsive means exerts a force on the valve member which tends to cause the valve member to move to close the inlet. the valve assembly may form part of a breathing apparatus, that is to say, the valve assembly may be a so called demand vale". it may be fixed directly to a face mask or it may be connected to a mouth piece, for example, in an aqualuna. the pressure-respnsive means advantageously comprises a diaphragm of which one face is exposed to the ambient pressure and of which the other face is exposed to the pressure in the housing. preferably, the movable valve member is so connected to the pressure-responsive means that the pressure-responsive means acts only to tend to move the valve member to close the inlet. when the pressureresponsive means comprises a flexible diaphragm as referred to above, the valve member is preferably com=cted to the diaphragm by means of a rigid member which is fixed to, and extends from, the centre of the diaphragm in a direction substantially normal to the plane of the central part of the diaphragm and into the interior of the housing. it will be appreciated that, as a result of that arrangement, the diaphragm experiences a restoring couple if it tends to turn or rock rather than execute a purely translational movement. advantageously, the illovable valve member comprises a lever which is so mounted as to be pivotable about an axis, of which one part is arranged to open and close the inlet and which is connected to the pressure-responsive means at a point spaced apart from the inlet along the length of the lever. the use of a pivotally mounted lever as the movable valve member has the advantage that, as is explained in greater detail hereinafter, it facilitates the achieving of the desired balance of forces. preferably, the part of the movable valve member and the point at which the movable member is connected to the

claims:    1. a   valve    assembly which   comprises    a housing, an inlet for admitting   gas    into the housing   from    a source of gas at a superatmospheric pressure, a movable valve member which is capable of closing the gas inlet and which, in operation, is acted upon, at least when it is closed or nearly closed, by a   force    resulting from the pressure difference   between    the higher   pressure    gas   rpstçam    of the inlet and the lower pressure   oas    in the housing, the effect of   which    force is to tend to move the valve member to open the gas inlet,  and means responsive to the difference between the pressure in the housing and the   ambient    pressure, the   pressure-responsive    means being so connected to the valve member that, if the pressure in the housing exceeds the ambient pressure, at least by a certain amount, the pressure responsive means exerts a force on the valve member which tends to cause the valve member to move to close the inlet  2. a valve assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pressure-responsive means comprises a flexible   diaphragm    of   which    one face is exposed to the ambient pressure and of which the other face is exposed to the pressure in the housing.    3. a valve assembly as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,   wherein    the movable valve member is so connected to the pressure-responsive means that the pressure-responsive means   acts    only to tend to move the valve member to   chose    the   inlet       4. a valve assembly as claimed in claim 3 when dependent on claim 2, wherein the valve member is connected to the diaphragm by means of a rigid member which is fixed to, and extends from, the centre of the diaphragm in a direction   substantially    normal to the plane of the central part of the diaphragm and into the interior of the housing.    5. a valve assembly as claimed in any one   cf    claims 1 to 4, wherein the movable valve member comprises   z    lever which is so mounted as to be pivotable   about    an axis,   cf    which one part is arranged to open and close the inlet and which is connected to the pressure-responsive means at a point spaced apart from the inlet along the length of the lever.      6.    a valve assembly as claimed in   claim    5, wherein the part of the   movable    valve member and the point at which the movable member is connected to the pressure-responsive means are situated c   the      sar.e    side of the axis about which the lever is pivotable.    7. a   valve      assembly    as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the arrangement and dimensions are such that, in operation, the valve assembly maintains the gas in the housing at a superatmospheric pressure.    8. a valve assembly as claimed in an one of claims 1 to 7, when dependent on claim 2, wherein there is provided means tending to impede the flow of gas within the housing  from the inlet to the immediate vicinity of the pressureresponsive means.    9. a valve assembly as claimed in claim 8, wherein the impedance means comprises a cover member formed with an aperture through   which    the valve member extends and also with onc or more apertures situated   remote    from the inlet, which apertures form the only means of communication for the flow of ass   within    the housing between the regior of the   housing    that is   immediately    adjacent to the pressure- responsive means and   regions    of the housing remote from the pressure-responsive means.    10. a valve assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein there is
