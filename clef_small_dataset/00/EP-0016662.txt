<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to the injection moldable and  extrusion type electrically conductive polymeric blend com­ positions preferably having a viscosity at 200°c at 0. 73 sec⁻¹  of less than about 8 x 10⁵ poises.  the compositions used for  elastomeric articles include a neutralised sulphonated  polymer; graphite fibre at a concentration of 1 to 50 parts by  weight per 100 parts by weight of neutralised sulphonated  polymer; and a preferential plasticiser at less than 60 parts  by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the neutralised  sulphonated polymer.  the compositions may also optionally  include fillers, oils and other additives.  these blend composi­ tions can be readily processed due to their superior rheolo­ gical properties on conventional plastic fabrication equip­ ment, especially on low and high pressure injection molding  or extrusion equipment into electrically conductive articles  having excellent physical and electrical properties.
