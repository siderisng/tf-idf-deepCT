<ABSTRACT>
self-locking, clamp-up load determining threaded fasteners,  threaded fastener elements and fastening processes  using same.  the fastener comprises an internally threaded  collar (10) and an externally threaded pin (12) having a head  (26).  the collar has lobes (28) engaged by the flat sides (38)  of a socket of a driver (34); when a predetermined clamp-up  load, dependent upon the resistance to threading occurs, the  lobes (28) are upset by the driver and forced radially inward  into the material of the collar to cause material of the collar to  flow radially inward into void volumes defined between the  collar and flats (22) on the pin (12).  the driver is freed to  rotate on the collar and a joint has been made with a  predetermined clamp-up load and with the component parts  of the fastener locked together.
