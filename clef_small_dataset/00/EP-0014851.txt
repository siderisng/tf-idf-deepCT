<ABSTRACT>
 water-compatible compositions are described compris­ ing at least one resinous compound whose backbone is linear  and contains at least one oxyaryleneoxyalkylene or  oxyaryleneoxy(1,3-(2-hydroxy)alkylene) unit and which bears  at least two functional organic moieties through which cross-­ linking can occur (preferably groups having active hydrogen  and/or blocked isocyanato groups, more preferably aliphatic  hydroxyl groups) and at least one terminal pyridinium group  covalently bonded through the pyridinium nitrogen atom.   these compositions when mixed with water have a ph below  10.  these compositions are useful coating compositions  which find particular utility in cathodic electrodeposition.  the  compositions are prepared, for example, by reacting a linear  epoxy resin with a pyridine in the presence of sufficient  amount of a bronsted acid and water to stabilize the  pyridinium salt thus formed.  blocked isocyanates are compat­ ible cross-linkers with the new resinous compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
novel pyridinium-modified epoxy resins suitable for use in cathodic electrodeposition this invention is directed to a water -campatible composition comprising at least one resinous compound whose backbone is linear and contains at least one oxyaryleneoxyalkylene or oxyaryleneoxy(1,3-(2 -hydroxy)alkyl en) unit and which bears at least two functional cross-linking organic moities through which cross-linking can occur characterized in that the resinous compound contains at east one terminal pyridinium group covalently bonded through the pyridinium nitrogen aton the composition having a ph of less than 10. preferably the functional organic moieties through which cross-linlring can occur are active hydrogen and/or blocked isocyanate groups, more preferably aliphatic hydroxyl groups. by "active hydrogen" is meant active in the zerewitinoff reaction. depending pon the molecular weight of the resinous compounds and the nunter of pyridinium groups, the compositions of this invention range from water-soluble compositions having superb surfactant properties to water dispersible film-forming compositions which are read combined with water to form artificial latexes. the average molecular weight of these compounds ranges from 400 to 7000, preferably from 900 to 4000. aqueous dispersions comprising the pyridinium compositions of this invention are excellent coating compositions which find particular applicability in cathodic electrodeposition, for example, the pigmented latexes containing a suitable water-insoluble cross-linker and preferably having small particle size less than 1500 angstroms are excellent in this regard. the pyridinium compositions are also particularly useful for imparting corrosion resistance to coatings on steel. the pyridiniums here described represent a unique class of ph independent compounds which differ greatly from the conventinal tertiary amine resin systems which are dispersed in water with acids and which differ sharply from conventional quaternary ammonium systems known in the art. protonated amine dispersed systems are highly ph sensitive and the charge density varies directly with the number af amine nitrogen; atoms which are protonated or deprotonated quaternary ammonium systems are ph independent, that is, unaffected by protonation or depro tcnation of the hetero atop, over substantially the entire ph range. the quaternary ammonium systems, for example, are stable for extended periods of time at ph of 12 or 13, which is the ps at or near the cathode surface having electrodeposition. the pyridinium resins, on the other hand, are ph independent over the useful ph range of from 3 to 10 but at a ph of greater than about 10, the pyridinium ring decomposes into various nonionic products. this instability at a ps of greater than about 10 leads to charge destruction at the cathode surface, with the simultaneous loss of colloidal stability which assists in the rapid deposition of a era conductive coating or resin particles on the cathode surface. this gives the pyridinium resin systems, therefore, the advantages both of the quaternary ammonium in terms of pn independence and the advantage of the tertiary amine type electrodeposition systems of charge destruction and instability at elevated pm. thus, more rapid current cut off and greater throing power are provided. the water-compatible compositions here described represent, therefore, a substantial advance in the
