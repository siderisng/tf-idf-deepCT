<ABSTRACT>
a molten material, such as a metal, is continuously cast  within an annular groove (13) in a radially extending, upper  surface of a first rotary member (11).  a portion of the annular  groove is enclosed by a radially extending, lower surface of a  second rotary member (12).  each of the rotary members is  cooled by a cooling medium which flows through, and/or is  applied by spraying within, its interior.  the rotary members  are rotated about two different, substantially vertical axes  with the molten material being fed into the annular groove in  the first rotary member, being transported within the annular  groove through a cooling region beneath the lower surface  of the second rotary member, and then being discharged  from the annular groove in a solidified condition.
