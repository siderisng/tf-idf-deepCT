<ABSTRACT>
1.  a thermostatic coarse/fine controller, in particular for washing machines, with a housing (1) and a capillary feeler-controlled cantilever heat expansion element (23) with an associated adjustement device (24), by means of which element (23) several snap switches (5, 6) which are independently adjustable to a switching point can be triggered via a common actuating element (21) characterized in that one of snap switches (5, 6) which can be operated by the common actuating element (21) after installation of the controller in an electric apparatus is provided with an externally operated device (25, 26, 27) for the random and interaction-free fine adjustment of the switching point within a defined range.
