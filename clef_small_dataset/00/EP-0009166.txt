<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for continuous heat trans­ fer of ink images onto the outer surfaces of continuously  moving generally cylindrical articles (46, 48) from a length  of continuously moving heat transfer sheet material having  thereon a series of uniformly spaced heat transferable ink  images by use of an elongated wrapping and heating tube  (20) for continuously wrapping a portion of the sheet ma­ terial into intimate contact with the outer surface of each  cylindrical article as the sheet material and the cylindrical  members move through the tube and for heating the wrap­ ped portion of the sheet material and the cylindrical articles  during movement through the tube to cause transfer of  the ink image to the articles within the tube.  the sheet  material is thereafter unwrapped and diassociated from  the decorated cylindrical members after passing through  the tube during continuous movement of the sheet material  and the printed cylindrical members.
