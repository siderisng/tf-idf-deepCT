<ABSTRACT>
a high resolution gaseous discharge display and/or  memory device (21) comprises a panel array of bistable  charge storage areas designated gaseous discharge cells or  sites, each cell having an associated pair of coordinate  orthogonal conductors (23a-23n and 25a-25n) defining the  cell walls which, when appropriately energized, produce a  confined gaseous discharge in the selected sites.  the conductors  (23a-23n and 25a-25n) are insulated from direct  contact with the gas by a dielectric insulator (33,35,39,41) the  dielectric insulator (39,41) being composed of a layer of  refractory material having high secondary emission characteristics  such as a group iia oxide doped with a group ia  element to prevent degradation of the dielectric during operation,  to increase the static margin of the panel and improve  the stability of the maximum and minimum sustain voltages,  thereby providing stable operating voltages and extending  the life of the gaseous discharge display panel.  other embodiments  of the dielectric insulator utilize additional small concentrations  of elements of groups viii or vib with the above  concentration.
