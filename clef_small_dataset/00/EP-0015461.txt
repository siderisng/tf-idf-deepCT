<ABSTRACT>
the components of the container, fed by suitable devices,  are assembled starting from the formation of a tray (13) adapt­ ed to contain calcium oxide granules and a hermetic envelope  containing water, by means of a conveyor (14) and several au­ tomatic or manual devices allowing a high output and finished  containers which are hightight and reliable in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
process and apparatus for making self-warming containers for precooked foods the present invention relates to a process as well as a corresponding apparatus for making self-warming containers for precooked foods, of the kind operating by means of an exothermic reaction between calcium oxide and water, said water being contained in a hermetically closed envelope, placed in a suitable tray containing also loose calcium oxide granules; opening of the water envelope is obtained at the moment of use by pulling a control strip projecting from the container and bearing at the other end a cutting member. u.s. patent specification no 3,871,357 discloses a self-warming container for precooked foods operating according to the above stated principle, but the manufacture of such a container was hitherto made with a semiautomatic process involving too many manual operations, which did not allow a mass production and did not guarantee a perfect product. the apparatus according to the present invention substantially consists of the combination of means for supporting and automatically unwinding a roll of flexible but strong material such as aluminium foil, means for lubricating said material, means for delivering and positioning said material under a cutting and forming die, means for assembling the tray with the outer box, means for batching the calcium oxide granules, means for superposing the hermetic water envelope to the granules, the control strip with the cutting member being already affixed to the envelope, means for superposing the food-containing preformed aluminium plate, means for compacting the container, means for seam folding the edges of the container, means for coupling the cover and means for positioning and advancing the container during the entire operative cycle. other features, advantages and objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the present invention, said description pointing out also the features of the process, and being given merely as a non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which: fig. 1 is a diagrammatic showing of the apparatus emboding the process of the present invention and more particularly illustrating the several operative stages and steps in order to attain the self-warming container for precooked foods, starting from a roll of aluminum foil and other preformed elements. with reference now to the single figure of the accompanying drawing, the preferred embodiment of the process and apparatus by which the selfwarming container is made is being disclosed in detail. it is important to point out, that some automatic devices being part of the apparatus may be steadily or temporarily replaced by manual operations: in the course of the description these apparatus will be indicated and the alternative manual procedures will also be pointed out. the aluminum foil roll 1 (which may also be of other flexible but resistant material of a suitable kind) is arranged on a unwinding device 2 which is causing it to rotate step by step in synchronism with the subsequent stages. the aluminum web is then being

claims.    1. a process for the continuous production of self-warming containers for precooked foods, of the kind operating by means of an exothermic reaction between calcium oxide and water, said water being contained in a hermetically closed envelope, placed in a suitable tray and is opened by drawing an outer control strip, comprising the steps of unwinding a roll of flexible but strong material such as aluminium foil, feeding and positioning the web coming from said roll under a tray forming and drawing die, assembling the tray inside the outer box fed by a stacking and feeding device, batching the required amount of calcium oxide granules in said tray, superposing to the granules said water envelope provided with a control strip having a cutting member, superposing a plate for holding the precooked foods,  compacting and seam folding the assembly and finally placing the cover so as to obtain the finished container.    2. the process of claim 1, wherein the unwinding operation is effected step by step and is controlled by two proximity sensors, detacting the amount of unwound web and controlling the advancement of said web.    3. the process of claim 1, wherein the compacting step is effected by automatically pressing the container between a conveyor on which the containers are placed during the assembling steps, and an inclined plane superposed thereto.    4. in an apparatus for continuously making self-warming containers for precooked foods, the combination comprising means for supporting and automatically unwinding a roll of flexible but strong web material such  as aluminium foil, means for lubricating said web material, means for conveying and positioning said web under a tray forming and cutting die, means for assembling the so formed tray with an outer box, means for batching calcium oxide granules into said tray, means for superposing to the granules a hermetic water envelope provided with a control strip having a cutting member, means for superposing a preformed plate for the precooked foods, means for compacting the container assembled elements, means for air tight seam folding of the container edges,   means for coupling a cover to the container and means for positioning and advancing the container during the whole operative cycle.    5. the combination of claim 4, wherein the means for assembling the tray on the outer box, the means for superposing the water envelope to the calcium oxide granules, the means for superposing the preformed food containing plate and the means for coupling the cover are consisting of automatic feeding and stacking devices.    6. the combination of claim 5 wherein the automatic feeding and stacking devices may be replaced by manual operations during the manufacturing cycle.    7. the combination of claim 4 wherein the means for positioning and advancing the container during the operative cycle are consisting of a conveyor running under the feeding and batching devices.
