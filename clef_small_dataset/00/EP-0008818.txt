<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a process and an apparatus using this process for the treatment of textile materials, such as spun yarns.  this process is characterised in that the spun yarn is stretched over a particular length of a stationary plane support (1), preferably in the form of loops (a) which partially overlap, in that the support together with the spun yarn is conveyed into an autoclave (10) and kept stationary in this, in order to be treated there, in that the autoclave is closed completely and the spun yarn is subjected there to any type of treatment, in that the autoclave is opened and the support together with the spun yarn is moved out of the autoclave and kept stationary, and in that finally the spun yarn is taken up from the stationary support and wound on a reel.
