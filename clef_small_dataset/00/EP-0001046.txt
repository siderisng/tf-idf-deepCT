<ABSTRACT>
1.  arrangement for making a seal between constructional components in structures above and below ground, especially for reinforced concrete tubbing in mining, in which the joint to be sealed is formed by a flat surface and a surface with a groove, in which is inserted a viscously elastic jointing strip (7), which abuts with its lateral sides against the groove side and cooperates with a viscously elastic pressure transmitting strip (8), while the jointing strip (7) and the pressure transmitting strip are supported on one another, characterised in that the jointing strip (7) is undulating in cross section and when developed is wider than the groove (2), and that the pressure transmitting strip (8) is fitted into the groove (2) while leaving in each case a gap (s) between its lateral sides (17, 18, 31, 32) and the lateral sides (4, 5, 20, 21) of the groove (2).
