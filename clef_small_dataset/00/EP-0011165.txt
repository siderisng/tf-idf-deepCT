<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for producing gaps (g) in a slide fastener  chain (z) is especially adapted for chain having plastic ele­ ments (f) of u-shape joined by imbedded connector threads  (c) and stitched to tape (t).  apparatus includes sliltting  means (62,64) which slice into and demolish fastener ele­ ments (f) in the gaps (g) as the slide fastener is drawn along,  and lancer elements (70) which are periodically activated to  cut the connecting threads (c) at the beginning and end of  the gap.  stitches (o) and tape (t) in gap are left intact.
