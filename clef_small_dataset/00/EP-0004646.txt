<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to a process for homopolymerizing ethylene employing high activity mg and ti containing complex catalysts in a low pressure gas phase fluid bed process to produce ethylene homopolymers having a density of ≧0.958 to ≦0.972 g/cm³ and a melt flow ratio of ≧22 to ≦32, and a process for producing a catalyst composition useful in the said homopolymerization. ethylene homopolymers having a density of ≧0.96 g/cm³ and a melt index in the range of 5 to 50 are useful for injection molding purposes requiring excellent impact strength properties, provided that they have a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. ethylene polymers having a density of ≧0.96 g/cm³ and a melt index of ≦20 can be made with the catalysts and low pressure gas phase processes described in us-a-3,023,203, 4,003,712 and 3,709,853. the polymers made with the supported chromium oxide, silylchromate and chromocene catalysts, respectively, of these patents, however, have a relatively broad molecular weight distribution, as evidenced by melt flow ratio values of ≧35. the polymers of these patents, therefore, have relatively limited use for injection molding applications requiring excellent impact strength properties. it is desirably, therefore, to provide catalysts which would enable one to readily prepare, in a gas phase fluid bed process, ethylene homopolymers which would have a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. to be commercially useful in a gas phase process, such as the fluid bed process of us-a-3,709,853, 4,003,712 and 4,011,382, and ca-a-991,798 and be-a-839,380, the catalyst employed must be a high activity catalyst, that is, it must have a level of productivity of ≧50,000, preferably ≧100,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal in the catalyst. this is so because such gas phase fluid bed processes usually do not employ any catalyst residue removing procedures. thus, the catalyst residue in the polymer must be so small that it can be left in the polymer without causing any undue problems in the hands of the resin fabricator and/or ultimate consumer. where a high activity catalyst is successfully used in such fluid bed processes the primary metal content of the resin is of the order of ≦20 parts per million (ppm) at a productivity level of ≧50,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal, and of the order of ≦10 ppm at a productivity level of ≧100,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal, and of the order of ≦3 ppm at a productivity level of ≧300,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal. low catalyst residue contents are also important where the catalyst is made with chlorine containing materials such as the titanium, magnesium and/or aluminum chlorides used in some so-called ziegler or ziegler-natta catalysts. high residual chlorine values in a molding resin will cause pitting and corrosion on the metal surfaces of the molding devices. cl residues of the order of ≧200 ppm are not commercially useful. us-a-3,989,881 discloses the use of a high activity catalyst for the manufacture, under slurry polymerization conditions, of ethylene polymers having a relatively
