<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing 1,2,4-triazole by reacting hydrazine with formamide, in which in the temperature range of 100 to 250 ° C in the presence of ammonia hydrazine with formamide in the molar ratio of 1 to 2.0 to 1Convert to 2.7.

<CLAIMS>
1. process for the preparation of 1,2,4-triazole by  reacting hydrazine with formamide in a multi-stage  cascade of reactors under atmospheric pressure or slight  subatmospheric pressure, characterised in that the  reaction of hydrazine with formamide is carried out in  the molar ratio of 1:2 to 1:2.7 in such a manner that  hydrazine is continuously reacted with formamide in the  first stage of a cascade of reactors at a temperature of  100 - 120°c, the reaction mixture is subsequently reacted  in a second stage at 160 - 200°c, the resulting volatile  reaction products are cooled to 110 - 150°c, and the  condensate obtained is recycled into the second stage,  and the entire reaction mixture obtained in the second  stage is subsequently reacted in a third stage at 160 -  230°c, the resulting volatile reaction products are  cooled to 40 - 80°c, the condensate is recycled into the  first stage, and the end product is continuously withdrawn  from the third stage. 2. process according to claim 1, characterised in  that a fourth reaction stage is added to the process  before the reaction product is withdrawn continuously,  the temperatures in the first three stages of the cascade  being selected as in the three-stage cascade of reactors,  and the temperature being increased in the fourth stage  to 195 - 240°c, the volatile reaction products resulting  in the second stage being cooled to 110 - 140°c, and the  condensate obtained being recycled into the second stage,  and the volatile reaction products obtained in the third     and fourth stages being cooled to 40 - 80°c, either  separately or jointly, and the condensate, or the  condensates, being recycled into the first stage, either  separately or jointly.
