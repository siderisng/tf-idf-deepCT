<ABSTRACT>
a method of producing cold agglomerates for use in  iron making including the steps of preparing a homogenized  mixture of powdered or granular iron-containing material,  a hydraulic bonding agent and optionally other additives,  adding water to said mixture, homogenizing the  resulting mixture, mechanically forming the resulting homogenized  mixture into agglomerates, and curing the resulting  green agglomerates.  in order to produce continuously  agglomerates of high strength in a relatively short time,  with high operational efficiency and safely without the use  of high pressure steam, said hydraulic bonding agent is  added in an amount within the range from 3 to 10 wt.  parts  per 100 wt.  parts of said iron-containing material, and the  curing is performed by the consecutive steps of allowing  the green agglomerates to stand in vessel (2) at ambient  temperature up to 60°c and in an atmosphere of normal  humidity or from 80 to 100% relative humidity during not  more than 3 days, steam treating the resulting agglomerates  in steam heating unit (6) at a temperature from 90 to  100°c and then air heating the steam treated agglomerates  in heating unit (10) at a temperature from 100 to 500°c.
