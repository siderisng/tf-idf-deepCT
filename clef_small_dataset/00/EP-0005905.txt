<ABSTRACT>
aminoplast resin pigments for paper making comprise  large surface area (>5 m²/g) particles, preferably of size  below 200 µm, made from an aminoplast resin made by  condensing formaldehyde with urea and/or melanine in the  presence of 0. 2 to 15 moles, per 100 moles of formaldehyde,  of sulphite, phosphate, phosphite or borate radicals.  the  resin may be converted to the particulate form by gelling the  resin in extended form by dilution with an aqueous acid,  followed by drying, curing, and comminution of the gelled  resin.  to effect gelation in extended form the resin is  preferably diluted to a resin solids content of less than 25%  by weight by the addition of sufficient acid to cause gelation  within 20 minutes.
