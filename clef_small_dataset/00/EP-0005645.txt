<ABSTRACT>
torque transmitting apparatus (10) including a shiftable  sleeve member (12) having locking and guiding splines (26a  and b) for coupling a first toothed member (14) having  external teeth (34) to either one of a pair of toothed members  (16), having external teeth (20), and spaced on axially  opposites sides thereof.  each locking spline (26a) has working  faces (40) whose ends include recesses (38) for axially  holding the sleeve member during the transmission of  torque to prevent undesirable disengagement during the  transmission of torque.  the recesses at each end of each  locking spline (26a) are spaced from each other with  substantially the same minimum chordal relationship as the  end of each of the other locking splines.  each guiding spline  (26b) has working faces (44) which are spaced so that the  chordal thickness therebetween is substantially equal to or  less than the corresponding minimum chordal thickness  between the recesses at the ends of each locking spline.   when the sleeve member (12) is shifted on the first toothed  member (14) into engagement with one of the toothed  members (16), the relationship between the locking and  guiding splines is such that the guiding splines serve to  maintain proper axial alignment between the three members  (12, 14, 16) and the locking splines serve to prevent  undesirable axial disengagement of the locking spline (26a)  of sleeve member (12) from the teeth (20) of the toothed  member (16) during torque transmission.  the guiding  splines (26b) also cooperate with the teeth (34) of member  (14) while disengaging the locking teeth (26a) from the teeth  (20) of member (16) to axially guide the sleeve member (12)  in the opposite direction.  in one preferred embodiment, the  locking and guiding splines are arranged in an alternating  relationship with each other.  another preferred relationship  has three guiding splines preferably equally circumferentially  spaced with respect to each other about the sleeve  member.
