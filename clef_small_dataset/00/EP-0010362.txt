<ABSTRACT>
a cracking catalyst composition co-impregnated with  rare earth oxide and with either chromium, manganese,  cobalt, nickel or platinum group metals.  such catalyst comÂ­ positions, when used in catalytic cracking processes, result in  significant reductions of sulfur content in the coke produced  thereby, in turn significantly reducing sulfur oxide (sox)  emission in the regeneration stack gases.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a cracking catalyst and to its use in cracking sulphur-containing hydrocarbon feedstocks to reduce the emission of sulfur oxides (sox) in the regenerator stack gases. in the regenerator of a catalytic cracking unit coke is burned off the catalyst to restore catalyst activity. the sulfur in the coke is converted to s02 and s03 (sox), the emission of which into the atmosphere must be minimized. there has now been discovered a cracking catalyst composition co-impregnated with a combination of a rare earth oxide and with either chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel or platinum group metals (ru, rh, pd, os, ir and pt). the starting composition is preferably a commercially manufactured material containing rey or rex crystalline aluminosilicate in a suitable matrix, such as the catalyst described in u.s. specification 3,556,988. the new cracking catalyst can be employed in fluidized or moving bed catalytic cracking units well known to the art and their use therein results in lowering of the sulfur content in the coke deposits produced on the catalyst material and thus of the s02 and s03 (sox) content of the regenerator flue gas. according to the invention, therefore, a cracking catalyst, comprising a composite of a rare earth exchanged crystalline aluminosilicate and a matrix wnich composite contains impregnated rare earth oxide in an amount between l and 10 weight percent of its exchange capacity, is characterized by further containing, co-impregnated with said rare earth oxides between 0.05 and 5 weight percent (expressed as oxide) of chranium, manganese, cobalt or nickel, or between 0.1 and 200 pp of a platinum group metal. the platinum group metal is preferably platinum itself, and is usually present in an amount between 0.5 and 10 ppm, while the amount of the chromium, manganese, cobalt or nickel is usually between 0.1 and 2 weight percent (expressed as oxide). as for the balance of the composition, the amount of impregnated rare earth oxide is preferably between 1 and 5 weight percent of said exchange capacity, the crystalline aluminosilicate is preferably zeolite y, and the matrix in a favoured embodiment comprises silica, clay and zirconia. suitable crystalline aluminosilicates, and their matrixing, are described in u.s. specifications 3,140,249 and 3,140,253. representative crystalline aluminosilicates suitable for the present invention include those natural and synthetic crystalline aluminosilicates having uniform pores of a diameter preferably between about 3 and 15 angstrom units. such crystalline aluminosilicates include zeolite a (u.s. patent 2,882,243), zeolite x (u.s. patent 2,882,244), zeolite y (u.s. patent 3,130,007), zeolite zk-5 (u.s. patent 3,247,195), zeolite zk-4 (u.s. patent 3,314,752) zeolite zsm-5 (u.s. patent 3,702,886), zeolite zsm-11 (u.s. patent 3,709,979) and zeolite zsm-12 (u.s. patent 3,832,449), synthetic mordenite, dealuminized synthetic mordenite merely to name a few, as well as naturally occurring zeolites including chabazite, faujasite, mordenite, and the like. crystalline aluminosilicates having pore diameters between about 3 and 5 angstrom units may be suitable for shape selective conversion catalysis, while crystalline aluminosilicates having pore diameter between about 6 and 15 angstrom units are preferred by hydrocarbon conversion
