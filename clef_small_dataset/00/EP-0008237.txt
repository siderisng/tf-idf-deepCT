<ABSTRACT>
a displacement current sensor for generating electrical  signals representative of relative motion between a con­ ductor (11) and an electric field source (12).  the sensor  includes means (12) for generating an electric field and  electrically conductive means (11) positioned for inter­ action with the electric field, the field generating means  (12) and the electrically conductive means (11) being relat­ ively movable so that variations in the field encountered  by the electrically conductive means induces a displace­ ment current, as opposed to a conduction current, in the  electrically conductive means (11).  the field generating  means (12) preferably is fabricated from an electret formed  in any one of a wide variety of geometrical shapes, such  as planar, cylindrical or special geometrical configura­ tions; the electrically conductive means (11) may com­ prise one or more plates, wires, rods, or other special  shapes.
