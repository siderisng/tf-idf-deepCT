<ABSTRACT>
linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers having an  average degree of polymerization of about 15 to 100 are con­ veniently prepared by heating linear phosphonitrilic chloride  oligomers (e. g. , (pncl₂)₂₋₁₀) concurrently removing the phos­ phorus pentachloride vapors evolved.  heating temperatures  of 275°c.  -350°c and heating periods of from one to twenty  and especially one to seven hours are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
phosphonitrilic cl-lloide pleionoters this invention relates to the preparation of liquid, linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers having a number average molecular weight of at least about 1450. more specifically, this invention relates to a process for producing linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers in relatively short time in which the pleionomer product is a viscous, light orange or yellow oil soluble in toluene and chloroform. phosphonitrilic chlorides are well known materials and are generally distinguished as cyclic (trimer, tetramer, pentamer, etc.) or linear. representative art relating to the preparation and reaction of cyclic (pnc12)n polymers includes u. s. 3,359,080; u. s. 3,367,750; u. s. 3,462,247; and u. s. 3,780,162. linear phosphonitrilic chlorides may be further classified as oligomers, pleionomers or polymers depending on their molecular weight. according to the encyclopedia of polymer science and technology, vol. 9, 485 (1968), oligomers have a molecular weight up to about 1,000, pleionomers have a molecular weight in the range of from about 1,000 to about 10,000 and polymers have a molecular weight above 10,000. prior art relating to linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers, pleionomers and polymers include paddock et al, advances in organic chemistry and radiochemistry, vol. i, new york, academic press (1959), pp. 351-353, 359-6q1, wherein the reaction of nh4c1 with pcl5 and products therefrom are discussed. u. s. 3,545,942 patented december 8, 1970 discloses a method of thermally stabilizing linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers by heating at 2400-260oc. for 2 to 8 hours. methods for preparing linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers from linear oligomers have been disclosed in the art. for example, u. s. 3,443,913 discloses a method wherein linear (pnc12)3 15 oligomers are heated at 2400-2600c. to produce linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers having a molecular weight between 3,000 and 10,000. however, this process ir.- volves heating for long periods of time, the endpoint of the polymerization occurring about 40 to 60 hours after heating has been initiated. the product obtained via this process is reported to be a dark orange viscous oil. see also james m. maselli, thomas bieniek and rip g. rice (w. r. grace and company), phosphonitrilic laminating resins, air force materials laboratory, technical report afml-65-314; wright-patterson air force base, ohio: june, 1965, page 18 which describes this same process. at page 47 of this report maselli et al describe an experiment wherein oligomeric phosphonitrilic chloride was placed in a resin kettle fitted with a nitrogen inlet, stirrer and exhaust tube concenser. the resin kettle was heated to 2500 t 10 c. for a total of 55 hours while the oligomeric (pncl2)n was stirred under a blanket of dry nitrogen. samples of the reaction material were taken at selected intervals of time during the heating for molecular weight determination. the resulting data were as follows: molecular weight (hours) (vpo) start 700 10 1200 40 3200 55 6900 according to the authors, when the heating was continued for an additional 8 hours at temperatures in excess of 250 c., the viscous, soluble oil (m. wt. 6900) was converted to the familiar insoluble "inorganic rubber". in
