<ABSTRACT>
In a flow machine, a disk-shaped impeller is provided, which has flow channels for a fluid whose inlet and outlet openings are each arranged on the front wheel on the impeller. In this case, the inlet openings have a different distance from the axis of rotation than the outlet openings. Each flow channel has a radially further and a radially closer deflection knee each with two legs, wherein the legs form a 90 degree angle together and each leads a leg of one knee to an entrance opening, while a leg of the other knee leads to an outlet opening. The other thighs of the two knees are executed to a roughly radial connecting portion, which connects the two deflection knees together. In order to achieve a higher step gap in the flow machine, it is provided that both the entrance as the outlet openings are located on the same front side of the impeller.
