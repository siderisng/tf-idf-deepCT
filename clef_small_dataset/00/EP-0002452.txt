<ABSTRACT>
a novel glycoprotein, alcotin a, is isolated from aloe, a  plant belonging to liliaceae.  the novel glycoprotein has a molecular weight of 1. 8 ×  10⁴ and a ratio of protein to sugar of 8 to 2 by weight, gives  only single band in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  without 2-mercaptoethanol treatment and however two  discrete bands in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  with 2-mercaptoethanol treatment, has hemagglutinating  and cytoagglutinating activity for transformed cells, has  mitogenic activity for lymphocytes, cap forming activity for  lymphocytes and cultured transformed cells using fluorescence  labelled glycoprotein, has binding reactivity with some  kind of serum proteins and has activating activity of complement  third component.  by reason of its biological activity it is useful as an active  substance in medicines against several diseases, such as  cancer, inflammation, burns and skin diseases.
