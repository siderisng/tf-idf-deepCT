<ABSTRACT>
a method for constructing a capacitive transducer  (20) by depositing a uniform glass insulating ring is disclosed  herein.  the capacitive transducer consists of a  circular base substrate (10) and a circular diaphragm (21),  each supporting one of two capacitor electrodes (22, 16)  and separated by a uniform glass insulating ring (14) which  determines a uniform air gap (23) between the capacitor  electrodes (22, 16).  pressure changes cause the diaphragm  (21) to flex and thereby produce capacitance changes in  relation to the pressure being sensed.  the thickness of  the glass insulating ring (14) is critical to the production  of an accurate pressure transducer (20) and is produced  in the following manner.  a first glass insulating ring layer  (14) is screen printed onto a substrate through a mask  having a pattern therein.  subsequently, the relative rotational  orientation between the mask pattern and the first  screened layer (14) is altered by a predetermined number  of degrees and a second screened layer is deposited on  top of the first layer (14).  by this technique, a uniformly  thick layer of glass frit (finely divided particles) is deposited  on the substrate (10) despite any imperfections or variations  in the thickness of the mask or the uniformity of the  pattern contained in the mask.
