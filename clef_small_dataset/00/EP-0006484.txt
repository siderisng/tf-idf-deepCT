<ABSTRACT>
a bubble storage system includes a closed loop pro­ pagation pattern suitable for use with a bubble lattice.  the  closed loop propagation pattern (12a-h) is folded and  contains, for example, segments of a hexagonal lattice  (18-d, 20a-d, 22a-d, 24a-d) connected by 60° turns  to obtain a close pack bubble storage configuration.  the  bubbles are propagated along the pattern consisting, pre­ ferably, of c-bar or chevron type permalloy elements by  a rotating magnetic field in the plane of the pattern.  in a  preferred embodiment, the folded closed loop propagation  pattern is surrounded by a region of non-propagating  bubbles retained by permalloy dot confinement means (26).
