<ABSTRACT>
a phase-locked loop has a pulse forming circuit (11, 12)  connected to one input of an exclusive or phase detector  (13).  the pulse forming circuit (11, 12) produces fixed width  output pulses for all transitions in its input signal.  variable  width and frequency pulses appearing as error signals at the  output of the phase detector (13) are processed in an amp­ lifier filter (15) to produce a control signal which is propor­ tional to the average voltage of the error signal, and which  controls the variable frequency oscillator in a conventional  manner.  using the pulse former (11, 12) allows operation of the  high gain exclusive or phase detector (13) in applications,  such as data recovery from magnetic media, where the syn­ chronising signals appear at intervals corresponding to  sub-harmonics of the clocking frequency.  the pulse forming circuit (11, 12) may comprise a further  exclusive or circuit (12) receiving incoming signals directly  and via a delay line (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
phase-locked loops this invention relates to phase-locked loops. a phase-locked loop essentially comprises a variable frequency oscillator and a feedback arrangement which enables the output of the variable frequency oscillator to maintain a predetermined phase and frequency relationship with an incoming signal. the variable frequency oscillator is controlled through an error signal obtained by comparing incoming signals in a phase detector with the output of the variable frequency oscillator, or signals derived from them. phase-locked loops are widely employed in demodulation, frequency synchronisation and synthesis, and other applications. many forms of data coding currently in use, e.g. to record data on magnetic media, involve the representation of different data values by the presence or absence respectively of a transition, or pulse, depending on the code, at a given instant within the data sequence. also, these codes do not normally contain separate clocking pulses which consequently have to be generated by the data recovery circuit from the timing information contained in the data sequence itself. a phase-locked loop designed to generate the clocking signals must operate in a harmonic mode to maintain lock in response to transitions or pulses which occur more or less randomly at intervals corresponding to various sub-harmonics of the clocking frequency. in contrast, the requirement that the phase-locked loop initially achieves a rapid lock onto the correct clocking frequency, usually in response to a preamble preceding the data sequence and consisting, for instance, of a series of evenly spaced pulses or transitions, indicates the need for a non-harmonic phase-locked loop. to resolve the conflicting demands of rapid initial locking and subsequent harmonic operation, it is proposed in u.s. patent 4 050 576 to switch operation of the phase-locked loop from a non-harmonic mode to a harmonic mode at the end of the preamble. to this end the error signal controlling the variable frequency oscillator is derived by two different routes, a switching arrangement being provided which effects the changeover in control from one route to the other. obvious disadvantages of this design are its complexity and the duplication of some of the components. in a different connection, a phase-locked loop which, additionally to a conventional phase detector, includes an auxiliary exclusive or phase detector, is known from "elektronik", 1973, heft 8. the exclusive or phase detector provides the fine turning of a square wave generator by comparing the output of the variable frequency oscillator with a fixed frequency, periodic output signal supplied from a quartz oscillator. the present invention is concerned with providing a phase-locked loop which is capable of quickly locking on to the correct clocking frequency of an incoming signal in response to a preamble, and of maintaining lock on that frequency even in response to signals at various sub-harmonics of the clocking frequency. the invention provides for a phase-locked loop in which a phase detector is preceded by a pulse forming circuit which provides a pulse train containing pulses at transitions of an input signal thereto. the phase comparator then compares this pulse train
