<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method of determination of the concentration of free bases, that is to say, of bases or hydroxides contributing oh**- ions into aqueous solution, with the exception of the bases introduced for the conditioning of the water of the solution, in an industrial water undergoing a set of treatments capable of making the concentration of pollutants in the form of bases and salts vary, comprising a measurement of the conductivity of the water after passing this water over ion-exchange resins which retain the cations in the solution and free instead h**+ ions and a determination of the value of the concentration of cations coming from the salts beginning with this measurement by the employment of the linear relationship existing between the cationic conductivity and the concentration of cations arising from the salts, characterized in that furthermore a measurement is carried out, of the total concentration of cations arising from the salts and from the bases by association of the measurements made from electrodes known in themselves, which are specific for each type of cation capable of being present, and in that the difference is calculated between the total concentration of cations and the concentration of cations arising from the salts, the result of this difference giving the value of the concentration of free bases in the water.
