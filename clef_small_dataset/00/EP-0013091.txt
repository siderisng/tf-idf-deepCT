<ABSTRACT>
a common defect in mos devices of the overlapping  polysilicon electrode type is unacceptably low breakdown  voltages due to breakdown in the oxide separating the elec­ trodes and/or separating one of the electrodes from the subs­ trate.  in the invention the first electrode (14) is etched to  remove portions (a) undercut by a previous oxide-etching  process.  the subsequently grown oxide layer is then of more  even thickness and thus less susceptible to breakdown.
