<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for laying down filamentary continuous material with the aid of a pair of rolls being rotated in opposite direction, on the surface of which rolls teeth (4) formed of rods and extending in the direction of rotation of the roll axes are arranged, said teeth (4) of the one roll fitting without contact between the teeth of the opposite roll and forming an engagement zone the lateral boundary planes of which engagement zone are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axes of rotation of the rolls and are formed by the edges (5, 6) of the approximately horizontal slopes (7) of the continuous material running between the rolls, and which teeth (4) are held only outside and laterally of the lateral boundary planes of the engagement zone, and in which device the continuous material is guided on a vertical path, characterized in that the teeth (4) are held only at one of their ends, that all of the teeth (4) of a roll are held at their same end, and that the held ends of the teeth (4) of one roll are located on different sides of the engagement zone compared to the teeth (4) of the other roll.
