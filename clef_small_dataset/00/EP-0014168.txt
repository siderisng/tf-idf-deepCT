<ABSTRACT>
1.  an automatic circular knitting machine for the manufacture of sports socks which, when turned inside out after being knitted up, display when worn a leg section with a standard appearance in which more than half the stitches consist of plain stitches and the foot section is completely formed in plain machine knit with the reverse of the machine knit on the outside, the knitting machine consisting of an upper cylinder (2) and a lower cylinder (3) set vertically between which is provided a small space for a guard plate (4) and in which there are grooves to guide the needles (5) which are driven by plates (6) coming from a control drum, the grooves of the two cylinders being opposite each other so that each needle, which has a small hook at each end, may be used either at the level of the upper cylinder or at the level of the lower cylinder, and may pass from one cylinder to the other, the upper cylinder being fitted with little plates (18) which facilitate the taking down of the yarn, means (8) being provided to ensure the guidance of the yarn when this yarn is brought to the upper cylinder and cylinders being provided to exert a pull on the yarn coming out from the lower part of the knitting machine, this knitting machine being characterized in that it further consists of means enabling the support for the little plates (18) which are linked to the upper cylinder (2) to be lowered in such a way that these little plates are at the usual level for taking the knitting yarn (7) and in that the means (8) for the guidance of the yarn when this yarn is brought to the upper cylinder (2) are arranged so that the yarn (7) coming out from the aforesaid means may come tangentially to the guard plate (4) at a point situated between the outlet of the means for guidance and the point where the needles make possible the taking of the yarn (7), these various contrivances being set to work when the leg part of the sock is being knitted up.
