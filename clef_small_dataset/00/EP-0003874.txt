<ABSTRACT>
the gas and light barrier properties of a web of thermoplastic  bags designed for aseptic packaging are improved by  laminating a material of high gas and light imperviousness,  such as metal foil, to the thermoplastic bag material during a  blown film extrusion process.  in one embodiment a pair of foil  laminates (26) are applied to opposite sides of an inflated tube  (16) by rollers (22) which flatten the tube to provide flat surfaces  (24) for the laminates being applied to the tube.  the  resulting laminated web has a pair of aligned, uncovered  longitudinal portions (32) along the centre of which a slit-seal  may be made to provide a pair of laminated webs each having  an uncovered longitudinal edge.  in another embodiment a  single sheet of foil having a width less than the full circumference  of the tube may be employed to provide a single web  having a longitudinal uncovered section.
