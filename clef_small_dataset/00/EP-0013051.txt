<ABSTRACT>
flame resistant thermoplastic moulding materials are  disclosed based on one or more thermoplastic polymers, a  bromine-containing copolymer and optionally one or more  flame-retardant metal compounds.  as the bromine-containing copolymer a copolymer of  nuclear brominated styrene with one or more other mono足 mers, such as acrylonitrile, styrene and/or alpha-足 methylstyrene, is used.  an abs-graft copolymer is preferably used as the ther足 moplastic polymer.  these moulding materials exhibit excel足 lent physical and working properties while retaining high  flame-retardant values.

<DESCRIPTION>
thermcplastic moulding; ma'1'lh an l) article prepared thereof' the present invention relates to a thermoplastic moulding material consisting of a mixture of (a) 40-95 % by weight of one or more thermoplastic polymers, (b) 5-55 % by weight of a bromine-containing polymer, and (c) up to 15 % by weight of one or more metal compounds. in all kind of plastics applications, it is a requirement for these plastics to have flameretarding properties. this applies in particular where these plastics are used in articles such as domestic appliances, in the automotive industry, and where they are used as building materials. the usual method by which flame-retarding properties are imparted to the plastics is the blending-in of flame retardants most of which contain bromine, for example brominated diphenyl compounds. together with antimony trioxide these flame retardants impart good flame-retarding properties to the plastics when they are included in the plastics mixture. however, these flame retardants have a major disadvantage in that the processing of the plastics incorporating bromine-containing flame retardants can give rise to problems and specifically in that the flame retardant or decomposition products thereof may be released. this can cause an offensive odor and, in addition, it is possible in certain cases for noxious compounds to be released. in addition, these blended-in flame retardants have an unfavorable effect on the mechanical properties of the plastics in which they are contained. many proposals have been made to overcome such difficulties. a large number of these proposals simply amounts to the replacement of the bromine-containing compounds with compounds containing nitrogen and/or phosphorus which are simply blended in the plastic. although in processing these compounds may give fewer problems than the bromine-containing flame retardants, for the most part they also have the disadvantage of adversely influencing the mechanical properties of the plastics while more often than not they are less effective than bromine-containing flame retardants. in the u.s. patent 3,474,067 polyolefin-based self-extinguishing moulding materials are described in which nuclear halogenated polystyrenes are incorporated in the composition. although these compositions do not exhibit the disadvantages with respect to release of flame retardant or flame retardant decomposition products, the impact strength of the composition is undesirably decreased, especially if use is made of rubber reinforced polymer compositions such as abs-polymers, high impact polystyrenes, high impact pvc, and the like. also, the nuclear halogenated polystyrenes have a negative influence on the heat distortion temperature of most polymers4 the object of the present invention is to provide a thermoplastic moulding material as described above which does not have the disadvantage mentioned for previously known materials. the thermoplastic moulding material according to the present invention is characterized in that the bromine-containing compound used is a polymer composed of (b-l) 95 to 25 % by weight of bromostyrene, and (b-2) 5 to 75 % by weight of one or more additional monomers. preferably the monomer used as component (b-2) consists of one or more monomers selected from styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, acrylonitrils, methacrylonitrile, maleic anhydride, vinylacetate, and esters of acrylic
