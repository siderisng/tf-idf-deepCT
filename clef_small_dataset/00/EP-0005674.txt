<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for manufacturing an anodic electrode, stable in dimensions, of the type comprising a core made of electroconducting material and an electrocatalytic conducting coating, characterized in that an electroconducting core is firstly made from a common metal melting at high temperature, such as iron, an iron alloy, aluminium, an aluminium alloy, copper, a copper alloy, said core is then introduced into a first molten high temperature electrolytic bath constituted by a mixture of alkali metal chlorides and of chlorides of valve metals, to form a first conducting coating on the core, said core provided with its first coating is then introduced into a second electrolytic bath comprising noble metals, to form a second electrocatalytic conducting coating on the core provided with its first conducting coating.
