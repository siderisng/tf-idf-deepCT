<ABSTRACT>
a hydraulic braking system for agricultural tractor-trailer  combinations, taking hydraulic power from a pump (p) on the  tractor.  the system includes a pressure control valve (1a)  movable by the main hydraulic service supply to connect the  main supply with a chamber (3) in communication with a re­ stricted bore (4) and an outlet for the by-passed braking fluid.   a pilot valve (1b) responsive to tractor braking pressure (at e),  or manually operable (at f), admits fluid to the tailer brakes (at  b) and operates a check-valve (34, 35, 38, 39) closing a con­ nection between the chamber (3) and a return line (40) for fluid  not required for braking.  the return line (40) may be connected  to a low pressure sink or to the flow at the services outlet port  preferably via another check valve.
