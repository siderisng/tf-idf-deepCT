<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a process of producing vinyl  polymers by an inversion polymerization technique in the  presence of a two layer coating on the internal surfaces of the  polymerization reactor.  by inversion polymerization is meant  conducting the initial stage of the polymerization reaction  wherein the monomer or monomers being polymerized constitute  the continuous phase and in the latter stage of  polymerization, water constitutes the continuous phase.  the  coatings comprise an undercoating of a polyaromatic amine,  or like material, and the top coating is comprised of a water-soluble  suspending agent, such as an alkyl or alkyl hydroxyalkyl  cellulose ether.  by means of the present inventive process,  polymer buildup on the internal surfaces of the reactor are  substantially reduced.
