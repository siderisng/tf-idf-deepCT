<ABSTRACT>
a process for producing a novel physical form of gluten  that can be utilized as a self-binder for meat-like products,  thereby excluding the need of, for example, egg albumen.   the novel physical form contains an inert material bound  within its matrix and is characterized by its net-like fibrous  structure, which fibres preferably have a diameter of less  than 2 mm and a viscosity of at least 50. 000 cps.  the novel physical form of gluten is obtained by agitating  vital wheat gluten with a reducing agent at a temperature  below 70Â°c and incorporating during said agitation the solid  inert material having a particle size below 5 cm diameter.  a  preferred type of said inert material is textured vegetable  protein.  the product obtained according to the invention can be  successfully utilized in meat industry, enhancing the binding  properties of the meat and improving its texture as an extender.
