<ABSTRACT>
1,2,3,6-tetrahydroisonicotinic acid and derivatives  thereof, methods and starting products for their preparation,  and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.  compounds  of formula    is which r″ is hydrogen, acetyl or a group    r₁-o--   wherein r₁ is c₁₋₈ alkyl; phenyl; substituted phenyl,  phenylalkyl in which the phenyl group may be substituted.  r′  is hydrogen; c₁₋₈ alkyl; phenyl; substituted phenyl,  phenylalkyl, substituted phenylalkyl or idanyl; or r′ is a  group  wherein r₂ and r₃ are hydrogen; c₁₋₆ alkyl; or phenylalkyl  and r₄ designates c₁₋₈ alkyl; phenyl; substituted phenyl or  phenylalkyl and salts thereof.   intermediates for preparing (i) are    in which z is hydrogen or a protecting group and w is hydrogen  or a readily removable group and salts thereof which  are subjected to dehydration and    in which z′ and w′ have the same meaning as z and w and  salts thereof, which are reacted with appropriate reagents.  the compounds (i) exhibit γ-aminobutyric acid related  activity and are useful as active ingredients in pharmaceutical  compositions.  they may additionally contain a minor  tranquilizer or a neuroleptic.
