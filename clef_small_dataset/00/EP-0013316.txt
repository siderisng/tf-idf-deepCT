<ABSTRACT>
A radio network is proposed, which comprises a main station (10), at least two relay stations (11, 12) and a plurality of substations (14, 15, 16). The understation introducing a speech radio sends a call signal (A) which is captured and evaluated by several relay stations EMP. Each relay station contains one time storage unit (25) downstream of its evaluator (20), which has a different characteristic time delay in each relay station. The relay station whose time-saving unit has the shortest time delay, sends its identifier (K) to the main station, and this answers the reception of the identification signal by a selective call signal determined only for the relay station in question and the transmission of the radio communication. All other time storage devices are reset by a particular signal that abuses the evaluers when they have not detected the selective call signal.
