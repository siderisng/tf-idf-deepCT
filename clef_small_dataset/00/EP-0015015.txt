<ABSTRACT>
a wheeled vehicle, such as a coach, is provided with a  suspension system for road wheels comprising an axle (12),  with a road wheel at each end, a transverse beam (20) parallel  to the axle (12), and structural members (21,22) coupling the  axle (12) to the beam (20), each extremity of the transverse  beam being spaced from the vehicle body by a resilient means  (24,25); the members (21,22) having parallel resilient exten­ sions (31,32) on the opposite side of the axle (12) to the beam  (20).  the end (35,36) of each extension (31,32) remote from  the axle is pivotably coupled to an anchorage on the vehicle  body forwardly of the axle (12).  each extension (31,32) has a  cross-section whose area reduces as the distance of the  cross-section from the axle (12) increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a suspenszçln for a wheeled vehicle. a low floor height is desirable in a vehicle, such as a coach, to which access needs to be readily had from outside the vehicle. the need for a low floor height can conflict with the use of previously knows suspensions which make use of coil springs which in a low floor arrangement would result in extensive intrusions through the floor and into the vehicle interior. a solution to the question of intrusion is to utilise air springs which can be made of relatively short length. however sufficient length suspension travel can introduce further problems particularly if the vehicle has a wide range of load capacity. a motor vehicle suspension is disclosed in uk patent 1,350,057 in which an axle is located longitudinally of the vehicle by a pair of longitudinally extending arms; each arm comprises a spring steel leaf disposed in a substantially vertical plane; one end of each leaf is pivotably connected to the vehicle body structure and the leaf is fixed to the axle so that the twisting movement of the axle relative to the body structure is accommodated by twisting of the leaf but rotation of the axle is resisted by the leaf; and suspension springs are mounted between the body structure and the arms at the end of the arms remote from their pivotal mounting to the vehicle body structure and the axle is fixed to the arms between the suspension springs and the pivotal mountings. with a suspension of this kind a considerable area is needed beneath the floor of the vehicle to accommodate components of sufficient size to provide the desired charactistic, it is also difficult to use such a suspension for steerable vehicle wheels. the present invention is intended to provide a suspension for a low floored vehicle which does not take up an excessive amount of underfloor space and which is also adapted to provide a steering system for the vehicle. according to the present invention a wheeled vehicle having a suspension comprising an axle having provision for at 1 st one wheel at each end of the axle, the axlc being located longitudinally of the vehicle by a pair of longitudinally extending arms which project both in front of and behind the axle is further characterised by: i) a beam parallel to and behind the axle; ii) resilient means spacing the beam from the remainder of the vehicle; iii) the arms projecting forwardly of the axle serving in a vertical plane as resilient extensions; the end of each resilient extension remote from the axle being pivotable coupled to an anchorage on the vehicle; each resilient extension having a cross-section whose area reduces as the distance with the section from the axle #increases; and iv) that part of the pair of the longitudinally extended arms which project behind the axle serving as rigid connections between the axle and the beam. preferably the axle or the beam, or both, are coupled to

claims:   1. a wheeled vehicle having a suspension comprising an axle having provision for at least one wheel at each end of the axle, the axle being located longitudinally of the vehicle by a pair of longitudinally extending arms which project both in front of and behind the axle and further characterised by:  i) a beam (20) parallel to and behind the axle (12); ii) resilient means (24,25) spacing the beam from the  remainder of the vehicle; iii) the arms   (31,32)    projecting forwardly of the axle  serving in a vertical plane as resilient extensions  (31,32); the end (35,36) of each resilient  extension remote from the axle (12) being  pivotably coupled to an anchorage on the vehicle;  each resilient extension (31,32) having a cross  section whose area reduces as the distance of the  section from the axle increases; and iv) that part (21,22) of the pair of the longitudinally  extending arms which project behind the axle (12)  serving as rigid connections between the axle (2)  and the beam(20).     2. a wheeled vehicle having a suspension as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the axle (12) is coupled to the rest of the vehicle by motion damping means (28,29).   3. a wheeled vehicle suspension as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the beam (20) is coupled to the rest of the vehicle by   motion    damping means (25,26).    4. a wheeled vehicle suspension as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the axle (12) is of i-beam section.   5. a wheeled vehicle suspension as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the beam   (0)    is laterally located relative to the rest of the vehicle by a panhard rod (39).   6 a wheeled vehicle suspension as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the provision  for the or each wheel (13,14) at each end of the axle   (1')    incorporates a steering linkage (15,16, 17,18,19) whereby the vehicle can be steered by way of the wheels (13,14).   7. a wheeled vehicle suspension as claimed in claim 7 characterised by a steering crank (44) pivotably mounted on a lowered central portion of the   axle(12),
