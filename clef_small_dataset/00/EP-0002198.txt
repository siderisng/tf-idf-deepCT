<ABSTRACT>
the process for producing coke, in particular furnace coke, uses considerable amounts of lean or relatively lean caking coal which is submitted to compaction so as to obtain pressed substances; these pressed substances are used on their own or mixed with additional material as charge in a coke furnace for the coking.  the coal (a) is submitted during compaction to forces acting upon different directions (d, t) in order to create shearing and/or rotating stress.  this causes the mutual fixing of the coal particles thus giving highly resistant pressed material with a high degree of conservation.  during compaction, heat can be brought to the material.  a device for application of this process comprises a matrix and an element which makes the material pass through the channels of the matrix.  these channels have different diameters and can also have different lengths.
