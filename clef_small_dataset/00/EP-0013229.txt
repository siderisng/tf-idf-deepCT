<ABSTRACT>
Method for polymerizing ethylene under a non-zion of between 600 and 3000 bar and at a temperature of between 160 ° C and 320 ° C, in two reactors functioning in parallel, namely a first reactor in which the reaction is carried out In the presence of less than 0.1% hydro gene for producing a high molecular weight polymer, a second reactor in which the reaction is carried out in the presence of 0.2 to 5% hydrogen to make a poly mother of low molecular weight, the effluents of these two reactors being relaxed and directed to a set of two interconnected separators so as to efficiently mix the polymers made in the two reactors by recycling in the power circuit of the first reactor as little as possible. Hydrogen such as the proportion of hydrogen in said first reactor remains less than 0.1% in moles. Application to the manufacture of ethylene polymers having a fluidity index of between 0.1 and 2 and a polydispersity index greater than 8.
