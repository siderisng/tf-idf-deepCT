bicyclic oxo-thiolactones, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, processes for their preparation and compounds useful as intermediates for their preparation. american home products corporation, a corporation organised and existing under the laus of the state of delaware, united states of america, of 585 third avenue, new york 10017, new york, united states of america. this invention concerns bicyclic oxo-thiolactones of the formula: emi2.1 in which r1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; r2 and r are, independently, hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, iower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or aryl; and r4, r5 and r6 are, independently, hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower hydroxyalkyl, aryl or arylalkyl, except that r4 and r5 may not both be alkyl. the compounds of the invention act as inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and are useful as agents for the treatment of hypertension and for the study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system of warm-blooded animals. also within the scope of the invention are the compounds as pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, methods of treatment of hypertension utilizing the compound c the invention, processes for the preparation of the compounds, intermediate compounds and processes for the preparat or of the intermediates. as used herein "lower alkyl" and "lower alkoxy" refer to groups having up to 4 carbon atoms. "aryl" refers to phenyl or phenyl substituted by a halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or hydroxy group. "arylalkyl" refers to benzyl or benzyl substituted as above for phenyl, halogen refers to chlorine, bromine and fluorine. tn pharmacological research on hypertension, recent attention has focused on the study of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, and, in particular, on the development of an effective anti-hypertensive agent which would, theoretically, achieve its result by inhibiting the action of angiotensin converting enzyme in converting anpiotensin i to angiotensin ii. the inhibition of the production of angiotensin i i became important because of the discoveries that angiotensin ii is the most potent prosser agent (vasoconstrictor) present in the mammalian body and in addition, stimulates the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, thereby causing excessive sodium retention and fluid retention, contributing further to the hypertensive state. thus, inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii is belived to work directly on the primary biochemical mechanisms creating increases clood pressures. for a discription of these mechanisms and or the mammalian renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, see hypertension, genest et al., ed., chapters 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 (mcgraw-hill, 1977) and john h. laragh, "the ranin system in high blood pressure, from disbelief to reality: converting-enzyme blockade for analysis and treatement, "prog. in cardio. vasc. disease, xxi, no. 3, 159-166 (november, 1978). an extensive list of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is set forth in suzanne oparil's article entitles "angiotensin i converting enzyme and inhibitors" in genest et al., supre, chapter 6.3, at pp. 159-161. these inhibitors are summarised in table i, p 161, thereof and include chelating agents, suphonylating agents, heavy metal ions, suphhydryl binding reagents, and various peptides. the polypeptides described therein as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors include hormones, such as bradykinin; products of substrate digestion
