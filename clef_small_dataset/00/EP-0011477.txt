<ABSTRACT>
the method includes a sequence of deposition, mask­ ing, and etching steps, and produces an improved self-­ aligned mesfet.  the mesfet has a light acceptor (or donor)  impurity doped substrate (65), and light donor (or acceptor)  region (55) with a graded doping profile disposed over the  substrate (65) for operation as a gate channel region.  first  and second heavy donor (or acceptor) regions (50, 60) are  disposed over the substrate (65) and are adjacently stepped  down on either side of the light donor (or acceptor) region  (55) for operation as source and drain regions.  a schottky  contact (35) is disposed over the light donor (or acceptor)  region (55), and first and second ohmic contacts (25, 30) are  disposed over parts of the first and second heavy donor (or  acceptor) regions (50, 60) as source and drain connections.   first and second oxide regions (40, 50) are disposed between  the schottky contact (35) and each of the ohmic contacts (25,  30), the oxide regions (40, 45) being disposed respectively  over part of the heavy donor (or acceptor) regions (50, 60) for  inter-layer isolation relative to the light donor (or acceptor)  region (55).

<DESCRIPTION>
self-aligned mesfet and method of making same this invention rela tes to a self-aligned mesfet and a method of making a self-aligned mesfet. the mesfet comprises a substrate lightly doped with an acceptor (or donor) impurity, overlaid with relatively thin first and second areas alternating with areas of thick field oxide, with a heavy donor (or acceptor) impurity introduced into the substrate below the areas of thick oxide for enhancement switch and depletion load devices. european patent application no. 79300721.2 describes and claims a method of making a mesfet upon which the present invention is an improvement. although mesfets have high device gain relative to mosfets and do not require a thin gate oxide which limits the ultimate advancement of mos devices, mesfet devices have been relatively unnoticed in the past asa result of their large series source and drain resistances which tend to degrade the actual device gain more severely than mosfet devices. mesfet structures would only become attractive if the series resistance could be reduced by advanced photolithographic techniques which have not been well developed for practical use. therefore, it is highly desirable to devise means to minimize these undesirable resistances in mesfet structures without requiring advanced photolithographic techniques to thus make mesfets competitive with mosfets, and the present invention is intended to achieve this. the invention accordingly provides a method of making a self-aligned mesfet which is characterised by the steps of: a) introducing a relatively shallow donor (or acceptor) impurity in the substrate below the first and second thin oxide areas to define with graded profiles first and second light donor (or acceptor) areas therein; b) masking to expose only the second thin oxide area for a relatively deep donor (or acceptor) impurity introduction in the second light donor (or acceptor) area so that the depletion load device will be normally-on; c) layering of an etch resistant over the surface of the first and second thin oxide areas to form a sandwich thereof, and masking away the thin oxide areas to expose the first and second light donor (or acceptor) areas except for narrowly defined first and second gate sandwiches defined to be over gate channel regions; ; d) etching away the exposed first and second light donor (or acceptor) areas to a predetermined depth, and introducing a relatively heavy donor (or acceptor) impurity to define, within each of the light donor (or acceptor) areas, first and second heavy donor (or acceptor) areas as source and drain regions; e) depositing polysilicon and etching away, through masking, all but areas that are adjacent to a heavy donor (or acceptor) area and a thick oxide area, for defining source and drain ohmic contacts, and reoxidizing over the polysilicon areas and part of first and second heavy donor (or acceptor) areas for inter-layer isolation; and f) etching away first and second gate sandwiches thereby exposing first and second light donor (or acceptor) areas, and depositing schottky metal thereon for reaction into a schottky barrier for use as a schottky
