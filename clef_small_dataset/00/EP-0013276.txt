<ABSTRACT>
an optical mark reader for evaluating marks on docu­ ments uses a line scanning camera which generates signal  information indicative of marks on a scanned document; a  selectable memory containing several document formats to  choose from causes signal information from the scanned  document corresponding to the selected format to be trans­ mitted for evaluation.

<DESCRIPTION>
optical reading system this invention relates generally to optical mark reading systems, and more particularly to an optical reading system which extracts in formation from marks entered on documents. in conventional optical reading systems employed to extract information from characters or marks appearing on a document, such as, a student test answer sheet, a reading head is employed which consists of a mechanical mask having a plurality of apertures or .windows and an array of phototransistors aligned with the mask apertures to generate information as to the presence or absence of a mark on a small area of the document cor-responding to a mask aperture. each document vendor employs a unique format, or pattern of mark areas on the document, thus each document format requires a different reading head having a mechanical mask with an aperture pattern consistent with the mark area pattern of the particular document format. typically, the apertures of a mechanical mask form a linear array with a corresponding linear array of phototransistors aligned with the apertures. a document to be read is conveyed beneath the reading head such that the linear array of phototransistors extracts information on a line-by-line basis frorn the moving document. in the application of such an optical reading system to a test answer sheet on which a student has entered an answer selection by filling in a designated mark area with a graphite pencil, the phototransistors would transmit a signal on the basis of the light reflected from the por tion of the scan document defined by the corresponding mask aperture. the mechanical aperture mask of the conventional reading head of an optical reading system limits the use of the optical reading system to extracting information from a document format corresponding to the mechanically fixed pattern of apertures in the associated mechanical mask. this approach to defining the format sensitivity of an optical reading system significantly limits the flexibility of an optical reading system for extracting information from a variety of document formats. the object of this invention is to provide an optical reader without the disadvantages of prior art arrangements. the invention in its broad form consists in an optical mark-reader apparatus for reading and evaluating marked information from a document line by line, compris ing: a line scan video camera means for scanning success ive lines of a document and developing an analog video output signal corresponding to any marked information present on each scan line; analog-to-di-gital converter means connected to said line scan video camera means to convert the analog video output signal into a digital signal; a plurality of selectable document formats, each format defining a specific pattern of document areas or locations; selector means for selecting one of said plur ality of selectable document formats; and digital informa tion processing means operatively connected to said sel ectable document formats and said analog-to-digital con ester means and responding to the selected document format to process those portions of the digital signal of a scan line which correspond to
