<ABSTRACT>
a combination lock, particularly a domestic door lock,  comprises a rotable and axially movable plunger (14), a  plurality of axially displaceable pins (17, 17a) disposed  around the plunger (14), a rotary ward disc carried by the  plunger slots (19, 20, 21) in the pins (17, 17a) to allow rotary  movement of the plunger (14) only when selected ones of  the pins (17a) are axially displaced relative to the remainder  of the pins (17), to have slots (19) therein aligned with the  ward disc (18), and a member (23, 24) carried by the plunger  (14) and capable of moving the pins (17, 17a) to an aligned  position upon axial movement of the plunger (14).  a user  can move said selected pins (17a) to render the plunger (14)  turnable to open the door and then easily pull or push the  plunger to cause said member (23, 24) to re-align the pins  (17, 17a) to prevent the selected pins (17a) remaining depressed  and the "combination" visible.
