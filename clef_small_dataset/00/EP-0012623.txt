<ABSTRACT>
a transfer material comprising a carrier sheet, one face of which is provided with a coating of a composition comprising a colourless colour former and a waxy material in which the colour former is at least substantially soluble, an oily or fatty substance forming a transfer agent or mobiliser for causing transfer of the colour former from the carrier sheet to the face of a second or acceptor sheet caused to abut there-against.  by the application of mechanical pressure, the carrier sheet is pressed against such adjacent face, which latter is provided with an electron-absorbing substance, so as to form a coloured marking.  the transfer agent or mobiliser is wholly or partially encapsulated in micro-capsules, the encapsulated transfer agent being provided on either one of, or both, said coated faces.  hence, at worst, the transfer agent is only minimally absorbed by the carrier sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
colour reactive transfer viaterial the present invention relates to colour reactive transfer materials of the type which comprises a carrier sheet coated on its rear face and containing a substantially colourless colour former which is adapted to react, under mechanical pressure with a so-called colour acceptor which forms part of the front face coating of an adjacent second sheet located therebelow so as to form a coloured image of the latter. the rear face coating of the first sheet further comprises a waxy base layer which is solid at room temperature and oily and/or fatty substances, which are known as transfer agents or mobilisers. in conventional transfer materials of this type, the colour former is generally dissolved in oil and encapsulated in microcapsules. by so doing, during storage and handling undesired reactions of the colourless colour former with the colour acceptor on the abutting sheet are prevented. micro-capsules are, however, somewhat expensive to prepare and use. in order, therefore, to avoid the use of such microcapsules, it is aiready known to use colour formers which are soluble in the wax components of the composition applied to the rear face layer of the carrier sheet, but which are insoluble in the oily or greasy components thereof. this is disclosed in german offenlegungsschrift no. p 2747899.5. this proposal effectively prevents undesired colour reactions from occurring. however, in colour transfer materials of this type, there is a tendency for the oily components (the transfer agents or mobilisers) to be absorbed into the carrier sheet due to the limited oil retention capacity of the wax components. this, in turn, delays the transfer caused by the application of pressure to the backing layer and hence the colour reaction between the colour former and the acceptor. the present invention seeks to provide a transfer material of this general type in which the disadvantages mentioned hereinbefore are minimized. in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a colour reactive transfer material comprising a sheet or web of carrier material, one face of said sheet or web being provided with a coating comprising a colourless colour former which is capable, by the application of mechanical pressure thereto, of forming a coloured marking on the face of a second or acceptor sheet or web caused to abut thereagainst the second sheet or web having, on said abutting face, a surface coating of a colour acceptor including an electron-accepting material or substance, the coating on the carrier material further comprising a waxy material which is solid at room temperature and in which the colour former is at least substantially soluble, a transfer agent being provided for causing the transfer of the colour former from the backing sheet or web to the second sheet or web characterised in that the transfer agent is at least partially encapsulated in pressure-sensitive micro-capsules, the encapsulated transfer agent being provided on either one of, or both, said coated faces. by so doing, the migration of the transfer agent or mobiliser into the first or
