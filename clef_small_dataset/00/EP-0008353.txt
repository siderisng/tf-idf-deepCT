<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a system of automatically detec­ tingand classifying flaws on a surface of high quality tubing  such as nuclear steam generator tubing and nuclear reactor  fuel tubing.  the system uses a laser beam which is scanned  across the surface and at least two sensors (3,4) adjusted such  that the radiation is reflected from a deflect-free surface prin­ cipally received by one of the sensors but that there is a  predetermined amount of radiation in the other sensor.  a  dynamic average signal of the principal sensor is developed  as a function of scan position.  threshold circuitry (6,7) detects  when the ratio of sensor signal to average signal varies by a  predetermined amount.  special circuitry (8) is used to detect  the essentially simultaneous occurrence of at least two diffe­ rent preselected combinations of signal variations to identify  the type of defect.  this technique is an improvement over the  conventional visual flaw inspection method and provides a  quick, accurate and consistent inspection method.
