<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the preparation of coated glass fibres suitable for use as reinforcement of plastics, especially of preimpregnated smc and to plastics reinforced with such fibres.  the process for the preparation of the glass fibres is characterised in that the fibres are coated with an aqueous sizing composition containing essentionally:  -0 to 6% by weight of an aqueous solution of one or more modified epoxy resins or of an emulsion of one or more epoxy resins.   -4 to 20% by weight of an emulsion of a copolymer based on vinyl acetate and of acrylic monomers at least one of which contains an epoxide functional group,  -0. 02 to 1%  by weight of a coupling agent such as an organosilane,  -0. 2 to 1%  by weight of a hygroscopic salt,  -0 to 2%  by weight of a lubricant.   -0 to 1%  by weight of crystallisable acetic acid, - remainder to 100% of deionised water.
