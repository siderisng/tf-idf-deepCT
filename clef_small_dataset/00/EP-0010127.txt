<ABSTRACT>
A rotary-elastic shock and vibration damping coupling with two coupling rings (1,2), one of which is rotatably connected to the driving and the other with the abortional shaft. The two coupling rings are connected to each other with a rip-shaped rubber-elastic printing pad (3) and with a non-stretchable rope (4) whose cable strands are distributed evenly over the circumference of the pressure cushion and are guided through openings (6) in the coupling rings. These openings (6) are designed so great that the cable strands are not based on the walls of these openings even with the greatest possible mutual rotation of the two coupling rings. In addition, elastic spring bodies (7) are arranged on at least one of the two coupling rings in the areas of said openings for the ropes for the cable strands, whose elasticity of unavoidable differences in the lengths of the cable strands are compensated for their uniform power transmission and also serve to avoid cable creases and through these possible cable breaks at the edges of said openings.
