<ABSTRACT>
a workstation (10) includes a working area (12) inside an  enclosure (11) to which an operative can gain access via an  access aperture (13) beneath a transparent window, an air  circulation system, including a fan (16), being provided for  drawing air from the enclosure (11) and directing it back to  the enclosure (11) via a filter (15), an outlet being provided  downstream of the filter for diverting a proportion of the  clean air from the filter (15), so as to cause a lowering of  pressure inside the enclosure (11) sufficient to cause an  inflow of ambient air via the access aperture (13).
