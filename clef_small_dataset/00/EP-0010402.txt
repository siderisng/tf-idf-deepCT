<ABSTRACT>
a scroll-type compressor unit including fixed and orbiting  scroll members contained within a cylindrical housing.   each scroll member has an end plate and a spiral element.  in order to reduce the radius of the cylindrical housing, the  end plate of the orbiting scroll member is a circular plate  having a radius of (a + r/2) at minimum, and the center of the  spiral element of the orbiting scroll member is offset from the  center of the end plate by r/2 towards the radially outer  terminal end of the spiral element, assuming that the radius of  the orbital motion of the orbiting scroll member is r, and that  the distance between the center and the terminal end of each  spiral element is a.  the fixed scroll member is so disposed in  the cylindrical housing that the center of the cylindrical housing  is offset from the center of the spiral element towards the  radially outer terminal end of the spiral element thereof by  r/2.  in this arrangement, the inner radius of the cylindrical  compressor housing is reduced to (a + 3r/2) at minimum.
