<ABSTRACT>
a rim-stabilized steel ingot is produced by teeming a  rimming-type steel into an ingot mold until the mold is about  80 to 95% full, whereupon teeming is interrupted to allow a  rimming action of from ½ to 15 minutes.  thereafter, teeming is  recommenced until the mold is full, and during this recom­ menced teeming molten aluminum is added to the mold in an  amount sufficient to semi-kill the molten steel and yield from  0. 002 to 0. 008 dissolved aluminum in the ingot core.  cold  rolled products produced from such an ingot will exhibit form­ ing characteristics equivalent to those produced from ingots  having a fully killed core in certain applications.  such good  forming properties are attributable to the formation of small,  finely dispersed nonmetallic inclusions comparable to those  developed when the core is fully killed with molten aluminum.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of producing rim-stabilized steel ingots this invention relates to the production of rim-stabilized steel ingots. united states patent no. 3,754,591 is directed to a method for making rim-stabilized steel ingots whereby a rimming-type steel is teemed into an ingot mold until the mold is about 80 to 95% full, whereupon teeming is interrupted to allow a rimming action in the mold for a period of from 1/2 to 15 minutes. thereafter, teeming is continued until the mold is full. after teeming is commenced following the rimming action, sufficient molten aluminum is injected into the teem stream to completely kill the molten core, such that all the total required aluminum is added before teeming is complete. the practice as disclosed in that patent provides considerable advantages over more conventional procedures utilizing solid forms of aluminum. specifically, the use of molten aluminum as disclosed provides a higher aluminum recovery, better and more uniform aluminum distributicn, fewer stringer-type alumina inclusions, a higher incidence of a smaller dispersed, globular type (which is more desirable) of inclusions, and an absence of porosity at the rim-core interface. the superiority in using molten aluminum instead of solid aluminum to kill the core of the steel is associated with the fact that molten aluminum dissolves almost instantaneously in molten steel, thus minimizing the harmful effect of the difference in the densities between the two metals. because of these advantages, the resulting sheet steel products produced from such ingots are indeed superior to prior art rim-stabilized products in having exceptional drawability and good surface characteristics. in the few years since its development, that process has gained considerable commercial success, as more and more tons are produced by that process by various steel producers, for a progressively wider variety of applications. the progressively increasing use of the abovedescribed process however, has been accompanied by increasing problems. specifically, since the above process requires a complete killing of the ingot core, the ingots must be handled like any killed steel ingot. that is, unlike rimmed or semi-killed steel ingots, killed steel ingots must be allowed to solidify completely before they are moved in order to avoid segregation problems. such ingots therefore are colder when stripped and placed into a soaking pit, and accordingly must soak for a significantly longer period of time in order to reach a uniform hot working temperature. this not only increases the cost of production, but when significant tonnages are produced, can cause serious bottle-neck problems. indeed, some mills have such limited soaking pit capacities that they cannot sustain high production rates of rim-stabilized steels. while it is of course recognized that the above problems, characteristic of killed-steel production, can be alleviated by producing more rimmed or semi-killed steel ingots, the different types of teeming practices produce different steel characteristics, none of which are suitable for all applications. indeed, killed steels or rimstabilized core killed steels are far superior insofar as deep-drawing and other cold formability properties (rm, ar, ) are concerned. furthermore, the rim-stabilized steels core-killed

claims:    1. a method of producing rim-stabilized steel ingots, comprising teeming a rimming steel into an ingot mold until the mold is 80 to 95% full, permitting the teemed steel to rim for a period of 1/2 to 15 minutes, commencing teeming to substantially fill the ingot mold and adding molten aluminum during said recommenced teeming, said addition of molten aluminum being commenced after recommencement of teeming and terminated before termination of recommenced teeming, characterized by adding only enough molten aluminum as will give rise to a dissolved aluminum content in the ingot core of 0.002 to 0.008% and a dissolved oxygen content in the ingot core of 35 to 75 ppm.    2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterized by adding only enough molten aluminum as will provide an oxygen content in the ingot core of 50 to 60 ppm.
