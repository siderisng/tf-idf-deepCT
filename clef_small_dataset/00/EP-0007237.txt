<ABSTRACT>
a textured continuous filament yarn combining a luxÂ­ uriant, soft hand with improved moisture wicking for greater  comfort in garments.  some filaments have a denier which  varies at least 25% (preferably 300-500%;), and other  filaments have a helical cross-section.

<DESCRIPTION>
spun-like yarn specification the invention relates to a novel textured synthetic yarn combining a soft, luxuriant hand with improved moisture wicking. texturing of synthetic yarns has for many years been a significant industry. texturing, usually by the well known false-twist heat-set technique, improves the bulkiness of the yarn and reduces the harsh, slick hand typical of nontextured synthetic yarns. however, the improvement in hand available in fabrics made from known textured yarns still does not make them comparable to fabrics made from the finer natural fibers. conventional textured yarns made from synthetic yarns are also deficient in their moisture wicking properties: and fabrics prepared therefrom are not as comfortable when worn next to the skin as fabrics with superior wicking qualities. according to the present invention, these and other disadvantages of conventional textured synthetic yarns are overcome by provision of a novel textured synthetic yarn as set forth in detail below. according to a major aspect of the invention, there is provided a textured yarn having a soft, luxuriant hand and improved wicking comprising a first plurality of filaments comprising alternating s-twisted and z-tlvisted helically coiled regions connected by twist reversal regions, each of the first plurality of filaments having a cross-sectional area which varies from small values in thin regions to large values in thick regions along its length, the large values being at least 25% greater than the small values, the thick and thin regions being out of phase from filament to filament along the length of the yarn, and a second plurality of filaments comprising alternating s-twisted and z-twisted helically coiled regions connected by twist reversal regions, each of thesecondplurality of filaments having a crosssection comprising a spiral and wherein the outer portion of the spiral lies at the inside of the coils of the helically coiled regions. according to another aspect of the invention, the large values are between 250-500% of the small values. according to another aspect of the invention, the filaments are formed from polyester. according to another aspect of the invention, the filaments have average deniers between 1 and 12. according to another aspect of the invention, the spiral is open at its inner end. other aspects of the invention will in part be set forth below and will in part be obvious from the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which figure 1 is a vertical sectional view of an exemplary spinneret orifice used in preparing a first ,species of filament according to the present invention; figure 2 is a bottom plan view (looking up) of the figure 1 spinneret orifice; figure 3 is a graph of shrinkage versus spinning speed using polyester polymer, useful in explaining certain aspects of the invention; figure 4 is a bottom plan view of an exemplary spinneret orifice used in preparing a second species of filament according to the present invention; ; figure 5 is a side elevation view of the molten streams issuing from the figures 1 and 2 spinneret
