<ABSTRACT>
during the work hardening of a wire (w) by elongation in a deformation zone, in particular in a zone in which the wire (w) is bent backwards and forwards several times with stretching, the values for the yield point and the permanent elongation, which have fallen during cold forming, are raised without process annealing by compressing the wire slightly, by 1% to 3%, following the elongation, the compression being performed uniformly over its cross-section.
