<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to flats for use in carding ma­ chines, and according to the invention, the flat (60) has a  body which provides the clothing flange (62) and the essen­ tial reinforcing formation for that flange made as an ex­ trusion, part of the extrusion being removed at each end to  provide a flat-end (72) projecting beyond the clothing  flange and its reinforcing, this flat-end being adapted for  engagement with the usual bend and plain bowls of the  carding machine.  in the construction shown in the drawing, the extrud­ ed reinforcing comprises a hollow section (66), and the  flat also includes a separately formed nug (76) having a  spigot-and-socket (78, 80) connection with the extruded  body and a releaseable wear-sustaining component (74)  which provides the bevel surface of the flat.
