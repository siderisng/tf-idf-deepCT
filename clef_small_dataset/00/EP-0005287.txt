<DESCRIPTION>
a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture the invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol. aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures are widely used as gasoline. as a rule they are obtained by catalytic reforming of petroleum-based aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures which boil in the gasoline range. an investigation by the applicant into the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures from aliphatic compounds has shown that certain crystalline silicates recently synthesized for first time by the applicant are suitable for use as catalysts for the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures from methanol. by contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a catalyst containing one of these crystalline silicates, an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture boiling in the gasoline range is obtained in a high yield. the novel crystalline silicates which have the property of catalysing the above-mentioned conversion are characterized as follows: a) they are thermally stable up to temperatures above 6000c, b) they are capable, after dehydration at 4000c in vacuo, of absorbing more than 3% by weight of water at 25 c and saturated water vapour pressure, and c) they possess in the dehydrated form the following overall composition, expressed in moles of the oxides, (1.0+0.3)(r)2/,0./a fe,o,. b a1203. c ga203-7. y (d sio2. e geo2), wherein r = one or more mono- or bivalent cations, a ),o.1, b # 0 , c ,z, o a+b+c=1, y 10, d > , 0.1, e , 0, d+e= 1, and n = the valency of r. a drawback of the above-mentioned single-stage process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol is that a large amount of heat is liberated in the reaction. as a result it is extremely difficult to obviate undesirable temperature rises which adversely affect the catalyst life and the product composition. prolonged investigation in respect of this subject by the applicant has now shown that this drawback can be obviated by carrying out the process in two stages, methanol being converted into dimethyl ether in the first stage and dimethyl ether being converted into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture in the second stage. the first stage of the process should be carried out by contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a dehydration catalyst and the sedond stage by contacting dimethyl ether at elevated temperature with a catalyst which contains a crystalline silicate as defined above. the present patent application therefore relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol, which process is carried out in two stages in which dimethyl ether is prepared in the first stage by contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a dehydration catalyst and in which in the second stage an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture is prepared by contacting dimethyl ether form the first stage at elevated temperature with a catalyst which contains a crystalline silicate as defined above. methanol used as starting material in the process according to the invention may be very suitable prepared by contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide and
