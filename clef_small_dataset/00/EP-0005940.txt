<ABSTRACT>
clay pipes and the like (3) are fired in a kiln (1) through  which they are conveyed by a pusher conveyer (2,4) as  individual articles, instead of being carried on cars or in  containers.  in the main firing zone of the kiln the pipes (3) roll  along a surface (6) to maintain roundness and ensure  uniform heating.  in the preheating zone of the kiln the pipes  are carried by carriers (5) of the conveyer without rotating.   the pipes may also be carried without rotating in the final  cooling zone of the kiln.
