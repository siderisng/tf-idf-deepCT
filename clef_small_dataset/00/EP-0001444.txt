<ABSTRACT>
the disconnecting switch for high tension, designed as a hinged disconnecting switch, has a switch head on a bulkhead insulator, to which switch head the switch arm (5) is attached.  the switch head has a sliding bearing with a driven carriage (12) on which a disc-shaped element (19), having a detent (30), is supported in a rotatable manner.  the detent (30) interacts with a guide pin (20) attached to the switch head and is shaped such that, in conjunction (19) with the carriage movement, it displaces the disc-shaped element and hence the switch arm (5) in a hinge movement with a subsequent throw movement which is used for locking.  <image>
