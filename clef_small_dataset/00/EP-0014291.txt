<DESCRIPTION>
sulfur- and nitrogen-containtng hydrocarbon feed conversion end catalyst therefor this invention reiates to catalytic conversion of hydrocarbon feeds containing sulfur and nitrogen containing organic compounds, and to a catalyst therefor. zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic proerties for various types of hydrocarbon conversions. certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline alumlnosilicates having a definite crystalline structure within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of channels. these cavities and channeis are uniform in size. since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for absorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as "molecular sieves" and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline aluminosilicates. these aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of si04 and a104 in which the tetrahedra are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen is 1:2. the electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali met 21 or & . alkaline earth metal cation. this can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as ca/2, sr/2, na, k or li is equal to unity. one type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially by another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. by means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. the spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic aluminosilicates. these aluminosilicates have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite a (u.s. patent 2,882,243), zeolite x (u.s. patent 2,882,244), zeolite y (u.s. patent 3,130,007), zeolite zk-5 (u.s. patent 3,247,195), zeolite zk-4 (u.s. patent 3,314,752), zeolite zsm-5 (u.s. patent 3,702,886), zeolite zsm-11 (u.s. patent 3,832,449), zeolite zsm-12 (u.s. patent 3,832,449), and zeolite zsm-20 (u.s. patent 3,972,983) merely to name a few. a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite well known in the art is faujasite. the zsm-20 zeolite for use in the present invention resembles fauj asite- in certain aspects of structure, but has a notably higher silica/alumina ratio than faujasite. the present invention relates to the use of a hydrogenation function containing synthetic crystalline zeolite zsm-20, or the thermally treated products thereof, for sulfur- and nitrogen-containing organic compound, e.g. hydrocarbon compound, conversion. the catalyst may be prepared by incorporating a platinum group metal (e.g. pd) into zsm-20. fjhen a hydrogenation component such as palladium is incorporated into the crystalline molecular sieve zeolite zsm-20, a catalyst is
