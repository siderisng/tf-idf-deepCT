<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for turning inside out hides, furs, pelts and  the like to be processed, comprises a vacuum chamber (10)  and a structure (17,22) defining an opening through a wall of  the chamber (10) and thereto a portion of the hide (23) may  be fixed.  the opening defining structure includes an outside  communicating duct (17), effective to be coupled to a nozzle  (22) provided for fitting thereon the hide (23) and controlled  by a control valve (18) adjusting the air flow through the  chamber opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
an apparatus for turning hides, furs, pelts, and the like, inside out this invention relates to an apparatus for turning hides inside out during the preparation and tanning or dressing thereof. the term 'hide' as used through this specification and claims should be intendr ed to include any animal skin, either raw or dressed, such as furs,pelts and the like. as is known, in the hide processing industry, and particularly so with furred hides, it is often necessary to turn raw hides inside out, which are usually removed undecided from the animal carcass. heretofore, this operation has been carried out in a purely manual fashion, so that trained personnel had to be put in charge of the job if the hides had to remain undamaged. the most widely applied current technique provides the use of a rod, secured with one end to a bench, which carries at its other end a head or enlarged body of a suitable diameters whereon z hide is forcibly fitted to be then turned inside out by the application of a sharp pull in the opposite direction, which completes in practice the hide inside-out turning process. it will be appreciated that this procedure is extremely tiring for the operator and, moreover, a time-consuming one. another drawback is that the quality of the processed hide is allowed to depend wholly on the operator's skill, thereby uniform processing is unlikely to be achieved. this invention sets out to eliminate the aforesaid problems by providing an apparatus for turning hides inside out during the preparation and tanning or dressing thereof, which affords the possi bility of carrying out the inside-out turning process in an automated manner, with attendant reduced labor requirements. within that general aim, it is possible to arrange that the apparatus for turning hides inside out according to the invention can minimize any wear and deterioration of the hides during their processing steps, while shaking at the same time off the hides any processing materials, such as salts, sawdust, powders, and the like. it is further possible to arrange that the apparatus according to the invention is highly reliable in operation and quite safe to use. according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for turning hides inside out, particularly during the preparation and processing thereof, characterized in that it comprises a chamber in communication with a vacuum source, at least one structure defining at least one opening through at least one wall of said chamber, said structure having a formation for securing a' portion of a hide to be turned inside out thereon, and air flcwcontrol means for controlling the air flow through said opening. further features and advantages will become more clearly apparent by making reference to the following detailed description of a preferred, though not limitative, embodiment of an apparatus for turning hides inside out during the preparation and processing thereof as illustrated by way of example only in the accompanying drawing, where: figure 1 illustrates somewhat diagramatically

<CLAIMS>
    c l a i m s       1.    an apparatus for turning hides inside out, particularly during the preparation and processing thereof, characterized in that it comprises a chamber (10) in communication with a vacuum source (14), at least one structure (17,22) defining at least one opening through at least one wall of said chamber (10j, said structure (17,22) having formation for securing a portion of a hide (23) to be turned inside out thereon, and air flow control means (18) for controlling the air flow through said   opening,     2. an apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that said structure comprises an externally communicated conduit (17) controlled by a tightness valve (18), to said conduit (17) there being removably connectable a nozzle (22) whereon the hide (23) to be turned inside out can be fitted, means (20,21) being also provided for opening said tightness valve which can be actuated from said chamber (10) outside.      3e    an apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that said   vacuwn    source comprises an   exhaust    fan (14) having its suction port located at the top of said chamber (10),  4. an apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises an opening solenoid (20) for actuating said tightness valve (18) and being operated through said opening means including a flexible  rod switch (21).     5. an apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that said conduit (17) is provided with a perforated   diaphragbl    therein effective to prevent said hide (23) from being   drawn    into said chamber (10).    6. an apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that it   comprises,in    the inner top portion of said chamber, a filtering   diaphragm      (30)   effective to bar impurities from entering said exhaust fan (14).
