<DESCRIPTION>
process for-preparing amino acids and esters, and intermediates therefor background of the disclosure the present invention is concerned with an efficient process for preparing a-vinyl substituent amino acids and esters and certain intermediates. certain a-vinyl-a-amino acids can be prepared by reducing the corresponding a-ethynyl a-amino acid. such processes are described in tetrahedron lett. 2745-2748; 3689-3692 (1977). a more efficient process for preparing a-vinyl-a-amino acids and esters has been discovered. summary of the invention a process for preparing a-vinl-a-amino acids and esters thereof from a novel intermediate of the formula: h3c-ch-c-coor n=c-r2 description of the preferred embodiments an embodiment of the present invention is process for preparing compounds having the formula: emi2.1 which comprises (a) treating a compound of the formula: emi2.2 with a strong amine base, (b) reacting, the product from (a) with an alkylating agent, emi2.3 and (c) hydrolyzing the product from (b), wherein r is alkyl, alkenyl or substituted alkyl, r1 is h or lower alkyl, r2 is the residue of an aldehyde r2cho, r3 is alkyl, alkenyl or substituted alkyl, r4 is alkyl-; substituted alkyl- or aryl sulfonyl, r5 is alkyl, aryl or alkaryl and x is c1, br or i. r is an alkyl, substituted alkyl or alkenyl group. preferred r substitutents are selected from the group consisting of: emi2.4 emi3.1 especially preferred r groups are emi3.2 r1 is a lower c1-c8, alkyl group, such as octyl, hexyl, pentyl, isopropyl, ethyl or methyl. preferred r1 groups are c1-c6-alkyl. a most preferred r1 group is methyl. r2 is the residue of an aldehyde formula r2 cho, having no a-hydrogen, where r2 is a phenyl or substituted phenyl group wherein the substituents are halo (cl, br or i) c1-c3 alkyl or no2. examples of specific r2 groups are phenyl, p-chlorophenyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 4-isopropylphenyl and the like. a preferred rê group is phenyl. r is an alkyl, alkenyl or substituted alkyl group which is the same as or readily convertible to the r group. readily convertible r3 groups are r groups which bear oh groups and are protected. examples of such protected moieties are emi4.1 z is h, lower alkyl e.g. ch3 or butyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl e.g. p-ch3-phenyl. a preferred z group is phenyl. r4is an alkyl, substituted alkyl or aryl sulfonyl group such as p-toluenesulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl, nitrophenylsulfonyl, chloraphenylsulfonyl, hexylsuifonyl, and the like. x is halo e.g. br, c1 or i. chloro is preferred. r5 is a c,-c5 alkyl group e.g. ch3, pentyl or isopropyl; an aryl group such as phenyl, bromophenyl, p-totyl, xylyl and the.like;.^an ararkyl group such as benzyl and the like. a preferred r5 group is the c1-c5 arkyl moiety, expecially methyl. the process of the present invention is illustrated by the following reaction equation sequence when ph is phenyl: emi5.1 emi6.1 the schiff,basp (a) is conveniently prepared from 6-chloro-a-amino butyric methyl ester hydrochloride using the process described helv. chem acta 40, 1531 (1957). the strong base in step a may be a suitable lithium dialkylamide. examples of such bases are lithium diisopropylamide, lithium dimethylamide,
