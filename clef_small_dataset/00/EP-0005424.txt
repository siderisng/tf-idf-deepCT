<ABSTRACT>
patient litter apparatus adapted for use in an air-ambulance operable to permit elevating and lowering the litter and patient while maintaining the litter in a horizontal position at all times and with provisions for locking the apparatus with the litter at a selected position of elevation, and further with provisions for attenuating a large scale force, such as that created by a downcrash of the air-ambulance, to thereby reduce the risk of injury to the patient and preserve the structural integrity of the apparatus.
