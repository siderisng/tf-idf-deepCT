<ABSTRACT>
a positive plate for a lead-acid storage battery has a grid  structure comprising a top bar (50), post means (52), a plural­ ity of spines (53) joined to the top bar, and retaining means  (t1) locating active material around the spines.  in order to protect parts of the grid structure which are not  in contact with the active material of the plate, a grid comple­ ment (60) of chemically inert material impermeable to battery  electrolyte is employed, having a top bar enclosure (61a), a  sleeve portion (64), and spin-engaging portions (62k, 62m)  formed integrally with and depending from the top bar  enclosure to extend around portions of the spines (53) at their  points of junction with the top bar (50), and depending wall  portions (80).  the plate is manufactured by wrapping or moulding said  grid complement means around said grid structure and  engaging the whole in the tubular retaining means.
