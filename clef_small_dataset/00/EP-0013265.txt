<ABSTRACT>
a valve seat assembly 42 adapted to fit within an annular  groove 44 in a butterfly valve body 12.  the seat assembly 42  includes a pair of opposed metal seat rings 62, 64 generally  l-shaped in cross section with overlapping outer legs 68, 78  seated and anchored in the bottom of the groove 44.  the seat  rings 62, 64 have flexible free inner end portions extending  radially inwardly of the groove terminating at outwardly  curled arcuate ends 76, 86 which contact the sealing surface  22 of the valve disc 16 and extend laterally of the groove in  spaced relation to an over the adjacent valve body 12.  a  resilient soft seal 66 is mounted between the metal seat rings  62, 64 and the sides 70, 80 of the metal seal rings 62, 64 are  corrugated to grip and retain the soft seal 66 in place.  the end  portions 74, 84 of each metal ring 62, 64 have a relatively long  free length and are easily flexed laterally and radially outÂ­ wardly of the valve body 16 by contact with the outer  periphery of the disc when the disc is moved to a closed  position to maintain sealing contact with the disc without  requiring a high operating torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
metallic seat assembly for valves as shown in united states patent no. 4,113,268 dated september 12, 1978, a sealing assembly for a butterfly valve is illustrated in which a soft primary seal is positioned between a pair of spaced metal secondary seals. the secondary metal seals are held out of contact with the seating surface of the butterfly disc by the soft seal under normal operating conditions. only when the soft primary seal is destroyed do the secondary metal seals engage the disc in sealing relation. a separate resilient backing ring urges the primary soft seal and the secondary metal seals inwardly toward the seating surface of the disc. copending application serial no. 894,787 of ronald d. wilkins filed april 10, 1978 for "seal assembly for butterfly valve" discloses a seal assembly mounted in an annular groove about the flow passage. the seal assembly includes a metallic body having a pair of outer legs seated in the bottom of the groove and a pair of inner legs contacting the outer periphery of the valve disc. a soft seal is positioned between the inner legs and the inner ends of the inner legs contact the valve disc to provide metal sealing surfaces. upon contact with the disc, the inner legs are urged radially outwardly. however, the inner legs do not have a large radial movement and a substantial frictional force is provided by contact with the inner legs upon radially outward movement which increases the operating torque for moving the valve between open and closed positions. with certain types of metal finishes or coatings on the valve disc, some scratching of the sealing surface on the valve disc might occur with a high frictional contact, particularly if the seal has a so-called knife edge metal contact surface. the seat assembly of the present invention comprises a combination metal and elastomer seat which is tight sealing, pressure and temperature responsive, and will continue to provide controlled seating in the event the soft elastomer seal is destroyed such as by fire or the like. a primary object of this invention is to provide a seat assembly which will accommodate a wide variation in seal contact with the valve disc while maintaining a tight seal without appreciable increases in the operating torque for the opening and closing of the valve disc. a further object of the invention is a valve seat design which is highly flexible and moves radially outwardly and laterally outwardly upon contact with the valve disc thereby to follow the sealing contour of the valve disc under all conditions of operation and to maintain a tight sealing contact therewith. the seat assembly of the present invention comprises an outer metal housing fitting within an annular groove in the body with free unrestrained inner end portions extending radially inwardly beyond the groove, the end portions having curled or arcuate ends extending in a direction generally laterally of the groove and terminating at a position laterally spaced from the groove. the inner end
