<ABSTRACT>
the plant, normally of the multiway type, is essentially  characterized by the fact that each way comprises a pair of  loudspeakers arranged one opposite the other, the dia­ phragms of which are enclosed in a space delimitated by  screening elements made of high acoustic absorption mater­ ial.  the said plant enables the sound diffusion to be uniform  in the surrounding space and makes it possible to limit greatly  undesired effects, such as for example, sound "haloes" and  identical sounds reproduced by different ways being out of  phase.
