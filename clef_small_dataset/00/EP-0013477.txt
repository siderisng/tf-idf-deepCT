<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides for waterproofing of a telephone  cable by the incorporation of longitudinal strands within the  sheath alongside the insulated conductors.  the strands have  deposited thereon a moisture sensitive swelling agent, such  as ethyl hydrogen cellulose, and in the event of the sheath  rupturing and the conductors being exposed to moisture the  swelling agent on the strands reacts with the moisture rapidly  forming a plug which prevents further ingress of the moisture.
