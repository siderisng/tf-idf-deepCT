<ABSTRACT>
the disclosures relates to apparatus for automatically  outfolding the leading and trailing gusset panels (21, 23)  of the end closure of a rectangular carton being moved  along a predetermined path on a continuous conveyor  (31).  first and second arms (43, 45) are attached to a  vertical shaft (51) and to a cylindrical holder (77) mounted  for independent rotation about the shaft (51).  the shaft  (51) and holder (67) rotate in opposite directions so that  one arm (43) contacts the leading gusset panel (21) and  folds it outward along a line at an angle to its hinged edges  and the other arm (45) subsequently contacts the trailing  gusset panel (23) and a similarly folds it outward.  a plow  (87) positioned adjacent the conveyor path begins to plow  the major end closure panel (19) toward the carton open­ ing while the rotating arm (43) is in contact with the lead­ ing gusset panel (21).
