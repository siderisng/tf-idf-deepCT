<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns the transmission of data from  a transmitting control unit to a disk file controller through  an interface cable the length of which may vary from one  installation to another thereby varying the propagation  delay through the cable from one installation to another.  a sync in signal from an and gate (26) of the disk  file controller is used to request data from the control unit.   a sync out signal is returned by the control unit.  a clock  generator supplies bit timing signals bit 0 to bit 7 to a  selector (24) and the selector issues a gating signal to an  and gate (31) to generate a sync in signal at a selected  one of the bit times as determined by a byte of control data  contained in a register (22).  the bit time is selected to  account for the propagation delay of the interface cable  such that the resultant sync out signal is returned at a  desired bit time appropriate for recording data at a preÂ­ defined location on a moving recording disk.
