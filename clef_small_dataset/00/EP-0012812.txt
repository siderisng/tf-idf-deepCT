<ABSTRACT>
Magnetic actuator in which the actuation element (12; 48, 58) is held in a tensioned position by a one-sided magnetic flux, whose flow density in its amplitude changes cyclically with time and by selective excitation of a compensation winding (30; 61)It is triggered, whereby the tripping triggering the half triggering is then counteracted when the flux density is lower than its maximum value.The maximum value of the retaining flow can be selected so high that this flux density is sufficient to retract the triggered actuating element (12; 48, 58) into its tensioned position.
