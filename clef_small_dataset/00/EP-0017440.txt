<ABSTRACT>
a heated chamber having at least one opening; closure  means for closing said at least one opening, said closure  means having at least a closed and open position; said  closure means and said opening having surfaces (16,14)  disposed for coming into proximity of one another in said  closed position, said surfaces forming a primary sealing  means for said heated chamber in said closed position, there  being a substance (110) applied to at least one of said  proximate surfaces, said substance having a property of  expanding upon the application of heat thereby forming a  secondary sealing means between said proximate surfaces  in said closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
sealing of heated chambers this invention relates to the sealing of heated chambers. more particularly, the invention relates to a heated chamber provided with improved sealing means, and to a method of sealing a heated chamber. it is well known especially from environmental reports and the news media that the sealing of ovens which produce noxious fumes, smoke, dust, etc., is a difficult art. only recently the coke industry in the major steel producing area of the united states has been threatened with a complete shutdown because of its inability to comply with the new environmental regulations of the environmental protection agency of the united states of america and the department of environmental resources of the commonwealth of pennsylvania. an example of a coke oven which presently has sealing problems, is a coke oven with a so-called koppers door. the coke oven with the koppers door utilizes an s-shaped seal for sealing the door against the jamb of the oven. because of irregularities in the jamb and seal, gases from within the coke oven readily leak past the jamb. in cases where the seal has been damaged by loading and unloading of coal and coke, gouges occur therein, which greatly increase the flow of noxious gases and fumes from the coke oven to the surrounding air. this leakage from damaged ovens is especially undesirable since the degree of pollution caused thereby is many times that of an oven in an undamaged condition. however, during long use, coke ovens are damaged by the constant loading and unloading and seal cleaning. therefore, a larger and larger percentage of the ovens leak at ever increasing rates. another door widely used in the coke industry is the wilputte door. the wilputte door has a diaphragam seal and a jamb with an adjustable screw for making contact more readily between the jamb and the door. the wilputte door also suffers from the same sort of problems as does the koppers door. a great need is also felt for an improved sealing arrangement therein. recent tests have shown that many of these doors in present operation in their present configurations do not permit operation within the guidelines set by the department of environmental resources and the environmental protection agency. the fact of the lack of capability of meeting these requirements is well known and has threatened to shut down the steel industry for lack of coke. therefore, a great need is felt for an improved door sealing arrangement which would permit operation within the guidelines of the environmental protection agency or the department of environmental resources. there are a great number of other applications where leakage from ovens and other heated chambers can be cured by the use of the present invention such as soaking pits, used for the soaking of iron ingots during the manufacture of iron and steel, furnaces and other examples which are too numerous to mention herein. a means of attempting to seal a coke oven is disclosed in u.s. patent no.

<CLAIMS>
claims:   1. a heated chamber having at least one opening; closure means for closing said at least one opening, said closure means having at least a closed and open position; said closure means and said opening having surfaces disposed for coming into proximity of one another in said closed position, said surfaces forming a primary sealing means for said heated chamber in said closed position, there being a substance applied to at least one of said proximate surfaces, said substance having a property of expanding upon the application of heat thereby forming a secondary sealing means between said proximate surfaces in said closed position.   2. a heated chamber according to claim 1, wherein said substance comprises an intumescent mixture.   3. a heated chamber according to claim 1, wherein said intumescent mixture comprises sodium silicate and glass.   4. a heated chamber according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said primary sealing means has voids therein permitting gases to leak therethrough, the substance forming the secondary sealing means having properties of adhering to at least one surface of said at least one opening or said closure means, said secondary sealing means being disposed in relationship with said primary sealing means such that  upon application of heat, said secondary sealing means expands and at least partially fills a portion of said voids in said primary sealing means whereby sealing of said heated chamber is enhanced.    5. a heated chamber according to claim 4, wherein said primary sealing means includes an s shaped seal.   6. a heated chamber according to claim 4 or 5, wherein said heated chamber comprises a coke oven.   7. a heated chamber according to claim 4 or 5, wherein said heated chamber comprises a coke oven with at least one koppers or wilputte door.   8. a method of sealing a heated chamber having at least one opening with closure means therefor, comprising the steps of: applying a substance, which expands upon heating, to at least one surface between said at least one opening and said closure means.   9. the method of claim 8, wherein said applying is accomplished by spraying or trowelling the substance onto said at least one surface.   10. the method of claim 8 or 9, wherein said substance is applied as a mixture comprised of sodium silicate and glass at approximately 400 centipoise.
