<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a process and apparatus for the production of an aroma flavor concentrate from aroma-and flavor-bearing substrates, especially roasted and ground coffee.  more particularly, the invention is concerned with a process for continuously dearomatizing and desorbing aroma and flavor constituents from said substrates by passing wet steam counter-currently through a continuous columnar bed of said substrate; said bed flowing upwardly through a substantially upright vacuum-tight desorption column.  wet steam is applied in an amount and manner to form and maintain a substantially stationary desorption zone in said flowing columnar bed at a finite distance above a bottom inlet of said upright desorption column.  the stationary desorption zone is formed by the condensation of the wet steam as it passes into a progressively cooler temperature gradient in said flowing columnar bed.  the temperature gradient is created by the continuous introduction of chilled fresh substrate through the bottom inlet.  a vaporous aroma flavor fraction and a desorbed soluble solids fraction are collected in separate cold traps in communication with said column at about said stationary desorption zone.
