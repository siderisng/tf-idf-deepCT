<ABSTRACT>
For interlocking devices for coke fillers, two-armed door latches the latch holder on the doorrah menu. By axial adjustment of the bolt, the door is pressed by means of a spring against the door frame. By means of a pressure medium acting against the spring, the latch is sprayed for non-locking or unlocking from the latch holders. Thinking spring and pressure medium against one with the bolt-connected piston within a closed housing, this device is particularly suitable for the coke oven operation, easy to manufacture and handle. For this purpose, a straight cylinder sleeve (9) with its bottom (8) with the intermediate circuit of an insulati layer (9) is attached to the door (2) and with a flat lid (10), the shaft (19) designed as the axis of rotation stored bearing head (21) of the bolt (22) is passed through and a terminal bore (16) has for the printing medium, closed and further lies the plane piston (13) at rest so on the lid (10) that the pressure molding is up to a small remainder In one or more annular, flat, connected to the connecting bore (16) concentric annular groove (17) between the piston (13) and lid (10) is displaced. Preferably, the cylindrical spring (11) is guided on its inner edge by guide sleeve (12), which serves simultaneously as a stop for piston (13). The locking and unlocking is effected by the coke oven machine after preparing a connection of the supply medium to the printing medium with the printer.
