<ABSTRACT>
a process for preparing an over-based, oil-soluble mag­ nesium salt of a sulphonic acid comprises contacting an acidic  gas in the presence of a promoter system with a mixture of an  oil-soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid, a light mag­ nesium oxide and an inert diluent.  the promoter system  comprises (1) a carboxylic compound selected from the group  of compounds consisting of lower carboxylic acids, lower  carboxylic anhydrides, substituted lower carboxylic acids,  and metal salts and esters of lower carboxylic acids, (2) water,  and optionally (3) a lower alkanol or lower alkoxy alkanol.  the  reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging from approx­ imately 10°c (50°f) up to reflux temperature of the mixture.  the volatile components are stripped from the reaction mix­ ture after absorption of the acidic gas is at a desired level to  give an over-based, oil-soluble magnewium salt of the sul­ phonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
h process for preparing over-based, oil-soluble magnesium salts. this invention relates to over-based, oil-soluble magnesium salts of sulphonic acids having metal ratios ranging from approximately 10 up to approximately 40 and processes for preparing such over-based magnesium salts of sulphonic acids. over-based, oil-soluble magnesium salts of sulphonic acids are used as additives in oil-based compositions, such as lubricants, greases, fuels, and the like. ¯ they function as detergents and acid neutralizers, thereby reducing wear and corrosion and extending the engine life. highly basic magnesium salts of a sulphonic acid having a metal ratio of equivalents of magnesium to equivalents of sulphonic acid ranging from 10 up to 40 or more, particularly the higher metal ratios of 20 to 40 have been difficult to prepare in a one-step operation using #go as a mg source. in systems previously described, either insufficient magnesium was dispersed or an unfiltered product resulted. it has been discovered that over-based magnesium sulphonates may be prepared in a one-step operation by using a reaction promoter system comprising (1) a carboxylic compound selected from the group of compounds consisting of lower carboxylic acids, lower carboxylic anhydriaes, substi tuted lower carboxylic acids, metal salts and esters of lower carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof, all having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms; (2) water and optionally (3) an alcohol selected from the group of compounds consisting of lower alkanols, lower alkoxy alkanols and mixtures thereof, all having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. such a promoter system gives a high quality over-based magnesium sulphonate having very high metal ratios which is suitable for use in various types of oil-based compositions. it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a process for manufacturing oil-soluble, over-based magnesium salts of sulphonic acids having metal ratios ranging from approximately 10 and upwards to approximately 40 or more where the product is prepared in a one-step operation of contacting the reaction mixture with an acidic gas. it is a further object of the invention to provide a reaction promoter system for use in processes for manufacturing oil-soluble, over-based magnesium salts of sulphonic acids having metal ratios of 10 up to 40 or more. it is another object of the invention to provide a process for preparing a magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid having very high metal ratios wherein over-basing of the sulphonic acid is accomplished by using a promoter system in combination with a light form of magnesium oxide. this invention provides a reaction promoter system for use in the manufacture of an over-based, oil-soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acid having metal ratios of from approximately 10 up to approximately 40 or more, in a one-step operation of contacting an acidic gas with a mixture containing the sulphonic acid to be over-based. according to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing an over-based oil soluble magnesium salt of a sulphonic acit having a metal ratio of equivalents of magnesium to equivalents of sulphonic acid of from approx -
