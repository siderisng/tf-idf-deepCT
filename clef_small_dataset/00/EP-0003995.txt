<ABSTRACT>
a portable workbench has a supporting structure defining  a supporting surface (6, 7).  the supporting structure  includes a collapsible leg assembly for supporting the supporting  surface (6, 7) above a floor surface.  a first top member  (8) having an upper surface (12) is supported by the supporting  structure on the supporting surface (6, 7).  a second top  member (9) likewise has an upper surface (15) and the upper  surface lies in a substantially horizontal plane.  the top members  (8, 9) also have respective mutually adjacent side walls  defining clamping surfaces (10, 11).  a guiding structure is  provided for guiding the second top member (9) relative to the  supporting structure.  the second top member (9) can be  moved along the guiding structure so as to adjust the position  of the second top member (9) with respect to the first top  member (8).  the guiding structure is pivotally mounted so  that the second top member (9) can be rotated from a first  position on the supporting surface whereat the upper surfaces  (12, 15) of the top members (8, 9) are in the same  horizontal plane to a second position whereat the second top  member (9) is in a plane transverse to the above-mentioned  horizontal plane so as to cause the clamping surfaces (10, 11)  and the supporting surface (6, 7) to conjointly define a three  point clamping system.  in the first position, the portable  workbench is suited for clamping workpieces having two surfaces  that are substantially parallel to each other; whereas, in  the second position, the portable workbench is especially  suited to clamping workpieces having a cylindrical or  polygonal shape such as, for example, a section of tubular  conduit.
