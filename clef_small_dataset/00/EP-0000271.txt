<ABSTRACT>
a position-sensitive neutral particle sensor comprises  two spaced parallel cathode arrays (10, 12), each comprising  a plurality of metal strips (16, 20) arranged adjacent and edge  to edge, the strips in one array being orthogonal to the strips  in the other array, the metal of which the cathode arrays are  formed being such that an incident neutral particle is converted  to a fast electron which escapes from the cathode;  and an anode array (14) between and parallel to the cathode  arrays and comprising a plurality of spaced wires.  when a neutral particle is converted by a cathode strip to  a fast electron (34) an avalanche forms and its presence can  be detected in one or more strips in each cathode, so that the  orthogonal position is determined.
