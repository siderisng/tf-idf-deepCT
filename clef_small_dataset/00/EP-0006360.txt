<ABSTRACT>
a polymer is described which has particular utility  as an additive imparting wet and dry strength to a paper  base.  the polymer is formed by the reaction of a poly­ mer of an n,n-disubstituted vinyl-benzyl amine or homo­ logue thereof with an epihalohydrin.

<DESCRIPTION>
wet strength paper additives background of the invention this invention relates to wet and dry strength additives for use with paper and particularly to additives derived from the condensation of an aromatic polymer having a plurality of pendant amine groups, with an epihalohydrin. as is well known, untreated paper, when wet, becomes exceedingly soft and tends to fall apart as the fibers of the paper lose interfiber bonding. to combat this tendency it has been found expedient to add to the paper a polymer that will adhere to the fibers and bond them together at the points where the fibers are in contact. the polymers help the paper to maintain its structure even when wet and are said therefore, to confer "wet strength". there are a number of polymers that have been employed for this purpose but probably the most successful have been those produced by the reaction of a polyamine with an epihalohydrin. this invention falls into this category but represents an advance in the art in terms of its superior hydrolytic stability, high polymer yield, efficiency of usage of the relatively expensive epihalohydrin and amine monomer reactants and very fast cure to produce the strengthened paper. discussion of the prior art a number of patents have issued which describe generally the reaction of a polyamine with epihalohydrin to produce resinous wet strength additives. the polymers described in u.s. patents 3,700,623; 3,833,531 and 3,840,504 are polymers or copolymers of diallylamine which, when reacted with epihalohydrin, yield adequate wet strength resins. canadian patent 776,566 describes wet strength additives which are copolymers of epihalohydrin with the reaction product of iminobispropylamine and a dihaloalkane. such additives however, tend to gel very readily, have a relatively poor shelf life and give modest wet strength properties. the polymeric additives of the present invention while formed by the reaction of tertiary amine groups with epihalohydrin molecules are quite distinct from the disclosures contained in the prior art and represent a high yield route to the production of a highly efficient wet and dry strength additive. statement of the invention the present invention provides a polymeric additive suitable for conferring wet strength on a cellulosic substrate wherein from 5 to 100% of the recurring units have the formula: emi2.1 radical derived from a water-soluble proton acid, r is a c1 to c3 alkylene group, r1 and r2 are each substituted or unsubstituted c1 to c alkyl groups or, taken with the nitrogen, together represent a saturated heterocyclic group, and b is an integer from 1 to 3. the polymeric additive of the invention is preferably obtained by the reaction of a vinyl polymer wherein from 5 to 100% of the recurring units have the formula: emi3.1 with an epihalohydrin at a ph of about 6.5 to 9.5 and a temperature of o-800c. and thereafter stabilizing the reaction product using a water soluble proton acid hx. as indicated below the above vinyl polymer tertiary amine is usually generated by neutralization of a corresponding quaternary amine salt using
