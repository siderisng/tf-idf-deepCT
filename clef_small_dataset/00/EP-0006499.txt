<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for object sampling, in particular ultrasonic scanning device, with Ge steering support (1) for at least one scanning head (2), in particular ultrasonic head, and with a device with angle encoders in the joints (7, 9) of the articulated support To detect point and / or direction coordinates of scanning at any spatial position of the sampling head (2) depending on angle signals of the winecular greater. An angular detection and relation is desired, which is considered compared to the prior art and yet highly accurate, noise is effective and reasonably priced. According to the invention, this is achieved by at least one synchronous motor (17, 18) preferably in each angle-detecting hinge (7, 9) of the hinge support (1) as an angular transmitter for the sinus and / or cosine of the angle value of the rotation angle (α, β) of the Motor axis as well as a purely electrical interconnection of individual or more synchronous motors in the sense of forming a torsional or resolver chain (17, 18) or a mixed chain of dividers and resolvers for converting sinusus or cosine values ​​detected angles of rotation in sums and / or differences From individual angles and / or in sine or cosine functions of such angular or angular differences.
