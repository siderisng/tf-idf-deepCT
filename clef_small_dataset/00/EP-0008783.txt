<ABSTRACT>
the method for decomposing raw materials at elevated temperatures and elevated pressure for obtaining pentoses, lignin and cellulose simultaneously entails the hydrolysis being carried out with the addition of a mixture of strong acids, water and alcohol.  the acids employed are mineral acids and/or organic acids or the anhydrides thereof, whose dissociation constant is at least 1. 76 x 10<-><4>.  in preferred embodiments, sulphurous acid or its anhydride so2 is employed as acid, and lignin is precipitated by removing alcohol, sulphurous acid and a proportion of the water by distillation.  the decomposition is carried out with a mixture which consists of 10 to 40% by weight of alkanol, 0. 2 to 2% by weight of acid and water.  a mixture of this type preferably contains as acid 0. 4 to 1. 5% by weight of sulphurous acid or 0. 4 to 0. 6% by weight of hydrochloric acid or 0. 5 to 0. 8% by weight of sulphuric acid and 20 to 40% by weight of alkanol.
