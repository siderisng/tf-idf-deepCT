<ABSTRACT>
phosphorus containing flame retardants are prepared  by a two step process having as essential steps:   1.  reacting diorgano organophosphonate with reactant  comprising phosphorus oxide reagent to yield a metaphosphate/phosphonate  reaction product, and thereafter;   2.  reacting the reaction product of step (1) with reactant  comprising epoxide to yield poly(oxyorganophosphate/phosphonate)  product.  selected novel poly(oxyorganophosphate/phosphonate)  products contain a backbone structure of repeating  units represented by the average formula:    wherein m is an integer from 1 to 50; r, r₁, and r₂ are  individually selected from saturated hydrocarbon radical,  alkaryl radical, aralkyl radical, and aryl radical; and r₃ is:    wherein r₄, r₅, r₆ and r₇ are individually selected from  hydrogen atom, hydrocarbon radical, and halogenated  hydrocarbon radical.  articles and compositions such as textiles and polyurethanes  are rendered flame retardant by incorporation of  poly(oxyorganophosphate/phosphonate) prepared by the  process of the invention particularly products of formula (i).
