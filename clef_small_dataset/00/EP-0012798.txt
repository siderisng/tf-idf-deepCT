<DESCRIPTION>
polymerizable acetylenic oligomers this invention relates to a polymerizable oligomer and a process of producing said oligomers. u. s. patent 3,300,457 discloses the preparation of acetylenic polymers by the self-condensation reaction resulting from the oxidative coupling of organic compounds containing at least two terminal acetylenic groups directly bonded to the organic nucleus. the process disclosed in the u. s. patent 3,300,457 comprises reacting such compounds with oxygen in homogeneous solution in the presence of a dissolved oxygen-carrying intermediate comprising an amine-basic cupric salt complex. according to the invention there is provided a polymerizable oligomer having the general formula: emi1.1 wherein d is emi1.2 m is -c=c-, -cec-cec, -o-, emi1.3 -s-, emi1.4 emi1.5 r is an alkyl or aromatic group, ar is an aromatic group, x is an integer greater than two but less than 30, z is either zero or an integer, y is an integer with the sum of y and z equal to x, and n is an integer from 1 to 10, said oligomer having more than two pendant acetylenic groups, the average molecular weight of said oligomer being from 200 to 10,000. further according to the invention there is provided a process for producing a polymerizable oligomer having the general formula: emi2.1 wherein d is emi2.2 m is -c-c-, -crc-cc, -o-, emi2.3 -s-, emi2.4 emi2.5 r is an alkyl or aromatic group; ar is an aromatic group, x is an integer greater than two but less than 30, z is either zero or an integer, y is an integer with the sum of y and z equal to x; and n is an integer from 1 to 10, said oligomer having more than two pendant acetylenic groups, the average molecular weight of said oligomer being from 200 to 10,000, the process comprising reacting a monomer containing at least two ethynyl groups in the presence of a catalyst with an aromatic acetylenic capping- agent having a molar excess over the monomer. preferably the molecular weight of the oligomer is from 400 to 2,000 and at least about 60% of the acetylenic groups are diacetylenic. when the expression "pendant" acetylenic group is used in connection with the formula above, it is used to have the ordinary meaning, i.e. to refer to groups which branch off the main chain, and also to include the terminal groups. it is preferred that diacetylenic groups constitute most of the pendant acetylenic groups. in the u. s. patent 3,3b0,457 when the starting material contained three or more terminal acetylenic groups, the product was a three-dimensional crosslinked, insoluble, infusible polymer. (see u. s. patent 3,300,456, column 2, lines 51-54.) furthermore, the polymers decompose at about 180 c. (col. 7, line 60). the oligomers of the present invention are prepolymers which, when polymerized, undergo cross-linking and yield polymers which have many desirable and unexpected properties. the oligomers can be processed into coatings and adhesive bonds by a wide variety of coating techniques, for example, either from a solution or from a melt. when the prepolymers
