<ABSTRACT>
a reforming process comprising contacting a sulfur-con­ taining hydrocarbon material in at least one scavenging or  sulfur removal zone (54) with at least one manganese-con­ taining composition at conditions to remove at least a portion  of said sulfur from said hydrocarbon material to produce a  hydrocarbon feedstock having a reduced concentration of  sulfur; and contacting said hydrocarbon feedstock with a  catalyst comprising, optionally a major amount of a porous  solid support, a minor catalytically effective amount of at least  one platinum-group metal component, optionally a minor  catalytically effective amount of at least one halogen  component, and optionally at least one rhenium component,  in the presence of hydrogen at hydrocarbon reforming  conditions in a reforming zone (56) to obtain a hydrocarbon  reformate product.
