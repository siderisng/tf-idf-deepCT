<ABSTRACT>
a wire stitcher for binding sets of sheets has a driver 106  for driving a staple through a set and an active clincher 201.  in  one form the clincher has a drive for the clincher ears which is  actuated by the driver 106.  the drive is by a spring 220 which  is loaded during a return motion of the clincher housing 202 at  the completion of a stitching operation.  in another form the  clincher ear drive is effected by a cam 250.  both forms are  capable of accommodating variations in set thickness essenÂ­ tially without affecting the timing of the operation of the  clincher ears 204 (figures 6 and 7).
