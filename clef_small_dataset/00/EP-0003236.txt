<ABSTRACT>
A low voltage circuit breaker (1) has a housing (2) of insulating material. The housing (2) is divided into a top (3) and a lower part (4) along a partial carrier (8). Inside, the housing (2) for receiving the adjacent polars of the multi-pole circuit breaker is divided by partitions (52, 53). The partition walls of the upper part (3) and the lower part (4) overlap each other on their entire length, while the outer walls (50, 51) of both housing parts (3, 4) substantially overlap each other in their entire length, d. H. , there are only short interruptions of the overlap. Due to the overlaps of the outer walls and the partition walls, it is achieved that the electrical crawl paths are extended within the insulating body and from an insulating material to an adjacent insulating material housing and that the passage of switchgas in adjacent spaces of a switch and between adjacent switches is prevented.
