<ABSTRACT>
sulfonamides of the general formula    rso₂nnhr₁ (i) or    wherein r is optionally substituted phenyl or optionally  substituted pyridyl;    r₁₂ is selected from various organic groups;   x is h, ch₃, ch₃o, cl or och₂ch₃;   y is ch₂ or o; and   w is o or s; and their agriculturally suitable salts,  exhibit herbicidal activity.  the compounds can be formu­ lated into herbicidal compositions in conventional manner.   the compounds of formula i may made by reacting a cor­ responding sulfonyl thiocyanate or isothiocyanate of the  formula rso₂ncw with an appropriate aminopyrimidine  derivative.  the compound of formula ii may be made by  appropriate alkylation of an alkali metal or alkaline earth  metal salt of a corresponding sulfonylthiourea.
