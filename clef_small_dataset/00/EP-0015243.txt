<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an unlimited and rotatable linear flue guide member by ball contact on a shaft.The element comprises an outer sleeve (1), of the balls (2) being disposed in circuits (3) circulating practiced in a tubular cage (4), the machon (1) having in its bore of the work areas (5) providing alternating the contact of the balls (2) with the shaft (7) and shallow release sectors (6) allowing the return of the balls.The cage (4) being provided with at least six closed ball circulation circuits (3) arranged regularly in equidistant pair (13), the number of these pairs (13) of closed circuits (3) being half the number of the number ofSectors (5), the two adjacent rectilinear of the two circuits of a pair (13) for mant an angle at the center smaller and at most equal to the angle at the center of a sector (5).
