<ABSTRACT>
chlorination of an acid with a chlorinating agent  produces a reation mixture from which the desired acid  chloride may be recovered by distillation.  in the chlorination  and distillation, by-products, polymers and degradation  products may be produced which can cause a decrease in  the yield of the desired acid chloride.  a particular problem  arises from the tendency of acid chlorides to degrade and/Â­ or polymerize when subjected to excessive temperatures  for long periods.  an improved process for recovering an  acid chloride from a mixture containing the acid consists  in distilling the acid chloride from the mixture in the presence  of an effective quantity of a distillation improvement  additive, such as an organo polysiloxane or a mineral oil,  which remains substantially liquid under the conditions of  distillation.  in this way the problems referred to are reduced  or overcome and increased yields of acid chloride  are obtained.
