<ABSTRACT>
an improved stabilized methylene chloride composition  useful in degreasing aluminum metal which contains as a  stabilizer therefor either methyl or ethyl formate alone or  mixtures thereof or a mixture of methyl formate and prop­ ylene oxide.  the stabilizer is employed at a concentration of at  least 1 percent by volume based on the methylene chloride  when the mixture of formates is used.  amounts of 1. 4 to 2. 0  are required when other combinations or a single stabilizer  component are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
stabilized methylene chloride formulation for vapor degreasing methylene chloride is a highly versatile and useful solvent for various industrial applications at both normal and elevated temperatures. a particularly important industrial use is the degreasing of metals which is widely practiced today. numerous solvents have been employed, and numerous variations of the degreasing procedure have been suggested. in one method of operating, the metal article to be degreased is brought into contact with the solvent in the liquid phase. this may be accomplished by immersing the article in a large body of the solvent, or by spraying the solvent on the surface of the article. in another common method of degreasing, known generally as vapor degreasing, the solvent is maintained at tie boiling point and in communication with a chamber adapted to contain a large amount of the solvent vapor. the article to be degreased is brought into contact with this vapor, and the solvent then condenses on the greasy metal surface. the condensed solvent removes grease and oil from the metal surface and drips off, usually returning to the boiling solvent. along with it goes dirt, which had adhered to the greasy surface. this dirt often includes metal chips. methylene chloride is known to be more stable than other chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as per chloroethylene, trichloroethylene and methyl chloroform when the solvents are used in unstabilized condition fo example, methylene chloride is more resistant to oxidation, hydrolysis and pyrolysis than other chlorinated solvents and does not substantially react with aluminum in the aluminum scratch test commonly sed to indicate unstabilized or minimally stabilized methyl chloroform. in addition, methylene chloride may be used to greater advantage in' vapor degreasing of metals than other known degreasing solvents, since it can be used effectively at lower temperatures due to its lower boiling point and excellent stability. methylene chloride is particularly desirable for such degreasing operations since it is substantially resistant to photochemical activity and therefor does not contribute to air pollution by smog formation. however, methylene chloride when used in various metal cleaning functions, including vapor degreasing, suffers the dis- advantage of being reactive with aromatic compounds in the presence of metals, metal halides and combinations thereof the presence of the -said metals -and halides causes a reac- tion with the methylene chloride to produce hydrochloric acid and objectionable high boiling tarry substances which render the methylene chloride unsuitable for further use the entire reaction of methylene chloride in the presence of aromatic compounds is not completely understood but is believed to be a condensation reaction catalyzed by metal, metal halides or combinations thereof. thus, the aromatic compound reaction with methylene chloride is believed to be catalyzed, or initiated and catalyzed by the presence of metals such 'åas aluminum, zinc,irdn and the like, halides of said metal and combinations of said metals and halides. such reactions are thought to be of the nature of a friedel-craft type reaction. aromatic compounds and metals such as aluminum, iron and zinc, their halides and combinations
