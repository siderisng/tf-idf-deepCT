<DESCRIPTION>
compact solid disinfecting composition containing a mixture of lithium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite the present invention is directed to a solid disinfecting composition which comprises a mixture of lithium hypcchlorite and calcium hypochlorite. more particularly, this invention pertains to a composite lithium hypochiorite/calcium hypochlorite solid article which supplies chlorine disinfectant to aqueous #edium. the solid composition may be in the shape of a tablet, wafer, bar, disc, square, or any convent5onally-shaped solid articles. it may optionally contain inorganic diluent salts which are compatible with the release of disinfectant to the aqueous environment. the lithium hypochlorite/ calcium hypochlorite solid slowly dissolves on contacting water, releasing chlorine disinfectant into the aqueous environment. hypochlorite compositions as sources of deodorizing chlorine gases are well known in the art. u.s. patent 3¯446,893 (hanford and newman), issued may 27 1969, discloses a solid hypochlorite combination with polyolefin plus a gas generating source fiic allows for quick release of chlorine us gases as the solid floats on water. u.s. patent 3,793,211 (kohlhepp and jass), issued february 19, 197d, discloses a lithium hypochlorite effervescent composition for use as a cleansing powder. u.s. patent 3,276,949 (robson and hodges), issued october 4, 1966, discloses a compound calcium hypochlorite tablet as a chlorine generating source in wash compositions. while lithium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite are desirable as available chlorine sources, each has some unfavorable features. calcium hypochlorite compositions tend not to dissolve completely and leave a residue of insoluble inorganics. this. may clog the dispensing mechanism and diminish the amount of active chlorine disinfectant which might be released to the aqueous environment. lithium hypochlorite dissolves better in cold water, while calcium hypochlorite dissolves better in warm water. lithium hypochlorite is a relatively scarce hypochlorite source, requiring more time and energy consuming methods lo prepare. according to the present invention, it has been found that by combining lithium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite within finite weight ratios in a compacted cake, a much more effective solid source for delivering active chlorine disinfectant to aqueous systems is produced than if either of these compounds is used alone. this compacted solid is extremely effective for dispensing chlorine in a controlled aqueous environment such as a toilet bowl. this composition dispenses a steady level of chlorine over a period of time and over a wide range of water temperature. this composition dissolves more evenly than prior art calcium hypochlorite compositions. the compositions of the invention also form less insoluble inorganic residue than compositions based upon calcium hypochlorite as the sole hypochlorite source. this reduction in insoluble residue reduces the tendency to cause clogging of toilet tank dispensers and also provides for more efficient delivery of all the active chlorine disinfectant in these compositions to aqueous systems. additionally, this composition may be feasibly incorporated into any conventional dispensing mechanism for contact with an aqueous environment. in a toilet tank environment, this development allows for better control of ¯lisinfectant dispensed to the toilet water medium with each flush. accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
