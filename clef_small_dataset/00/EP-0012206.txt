<ABSTRACT>
this regulated ac-dc power supply circuit comprises a  power supply transformer 10 having two sets of secondary  windings (20, 21; 52, 54) and a compensating transformer  (40) having axciting windings (42, 44) and two compensating  windings (22, 24).  the compensating windings  (22, 24) are connected individually in series circuit with  the principal power supply secondary windings (20, 21)  to which a full wave rectifier circuit (26, 28) and an electric  load (36) are connected.  the exciting windings of the  compensating supply transformer (40) have ac potential  applied thereto from the other secondary windings (52, 54)  on the power transformer (10) which also supply dc power  by means of another full wave rectifier circuit (46, 48) for  compensating control circuitry (60) which has an input  circuit connected across the load to sense potential variations  thereat and an output for varying the ac supply to the  exciting windings inversely of variations in load potential.   a differential amplifying circuit (64) is used for determining  the load potential variation.  the error signal produced at the  output of the differential amplifier circuit is applied to a  transistor (62) effectively to insert a dc component in inverse  feedback relationship into the exciting windings (42,  44) of the compensating transformer (40).  as the output  potential of the power supply increases, the input potential  to the rectifier assembly (46, 48) is decreased, and the  converse.  the direct current flow path is completed through  the load whereby little or no energy is dissipated elsewhere.
