<DESCRIPTION>
ine##ro1) and apparatus for forming a liner in a container closure field of the invention this invention relates to a method and an apparatus for forming a liner by feeding a liner stock into a container closure, especially a container closure having a relatively large diameter, and molding the liner stock into the desired shape description of the prior art it is important to form a liner of the desired shape in a container closure such as crown caps, screw caps or easily openable closures of various types in order to achieve good sealing between the closure and the opening end portion of a container such as bottles and cans. a conventional method for forming such a liner in a closure container, which is in commercial use, comprises extruding a liner stock in the heated and molten state composed of a thermoplastic resin such as a polyolefin or a vinyl chloride resin into a nearly spherical or cylindrical form from an extruder, feeding it to the center of the central panel portion of the container closure, and then molding the liner stock into the desired shape while it is still in the hot and molten state (see, for example, japanese patent publication no. 15447/61, japanese utility model publication no. 3515/72, and japanese laid-open patent publications nos, 110176/77 and 89583/78). the conventional method, however, has important problems that have to be solved. generally, that part of a container closure which essentially requires the presence of a liner is its peripheral edge portion corresponding to the opening end of a container. hence, the shape of the essential part of the liner is annular in the conventional method, however, the liner stock extruded from the extruder is roughly spherical or cylindrical, and such a liner stock is fed to the center of the central panel portion of the closure. this makes it necessary the cause a greater part of the liner stock to flow to the peripheral edge of the container closure when molding the liner stock. it has been found in practice that especially when the container closure is of a relatively large diameter, it is extremely difficult to cause a greater part of the liner material to flow to the peripheral edge of the container closure when the molten liner stock is to be molded into the desired shape, it is generally necessary to cool a molding tool, etc. cooling will in turn result in the cooling of the heated and molten liner stock, and thus cause a reduction in its flowability. even if a greater part of the liner stock can be caused to flow well to the peripheral edge of the closure as desired during the molding process, the flowing of the liner stock tends to result in a radial orientation of the liner stock. thus, when a load is exerted on the liner during or after mounting the closure on a container after the liner stock has been fully molded into the desired shape and cooled, cracks in
