<ABSTRACT>
a method and system for monitoring the angular deformation  of structural elements in a composite structure  in response to imposed mechanical vibrations in which  the structure is part of the monitoring system.  a plurality  of angular motion signal generating sensors are provided  at different selected locations in a composite structure,  each sensor being associated to a corresponding structural  element.  signals output from the sensors in response to  vibrations propagated within the composite structure are  detected and a vibration signature for the entire structure  is established.  the sensor outputs are subsequently monitored  and compared with the previously established vibration  signature to detect differences therebetween designating  changes in the vibration response and potential structural  failures.  the angular motion sensors employ a magnet  and a coil in which a voltage and current are induced in  response to angular deflections of the structural member  to which the sensor is attached.  several alternate sensor  configurations are shown.
