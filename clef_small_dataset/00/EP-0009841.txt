<ABSTRACT>
a duct system containing a movable plug body (110) and  a method for determining possible leakage in such a duct  system.  the duct system has retaining stations (1,2,3) to  retain the plug body (110).  the invention aims at a more  simple and versatile system of this type.  to cause the plug  body (110) to continue its movement through the duct after  being retained in such a station, the pressure difference of a  fluid in the duct between both sides of the plug body (110) is  increased, e. g.  by a pump (13), and the pump may be controlÂ­ led by control means (14) with programmed retention times  of the plug body (110) in the several stations.  pressures, fluid  flow quantities (at 10 and 12) and/or power of the pump  drive may be measured and applied to the control unit to  determine the position and movement of the plug body  (110).  the system may be used to discharge the fluid from  the duct at the retaining stations, e. g.  water for irrigation  purposes at long distances and/or for measuring leakage in  a long duct.  special transfer means (4) may be applied to  transmit the plug body (110) from the downstream end of the  duct (5) to the upstream end thereof (8).
