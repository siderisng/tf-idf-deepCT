<ABSTRACT>
a flange (18) has projections (16) which engage lips (14)  on a sealing strip (2) to attach the strip (2) to the flange (18).   the strip (2) has two side portions (10) extending from a base  (4) and the lips (14) are formed on the inner surface of the  side portions (10).  the free edge (20) of the flange (18)  presses against a diaphragm (6) spaced by a void (8) from  the base (4).  as a result, the pressure of the diaphragm (6) on  the flange (18) forces the projections (16) into abutment with  the lips (14).  as a result, the flange (18) and the strip (2) are  securely connected so that a considerable force is required to  remove the strip (2) from the flange (18) thereby preventing  accidental separation.  a tubular member (12) may be  attached to one of the side portions (10) against which abuts  an object being sealed to the flange.
