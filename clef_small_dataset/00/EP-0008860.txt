<ABSTRACT>
a method for conducting chemical reactions and fractio­ nation of the reaction mixture comprising feeding reactants to  a distillation column reactor into a feed zone and concurrently  contacting the reactants with a fixed bed catalytic packing to  concurrently carry out the reaction and fractionate the reac­ tion mixture, said catalytic packing being a component of  distillation system having both a catalytic function and a distil­ lation function.  for example, a method for preparing methyl  tertiary butyl ether in high purity from a mixed feed stream of  isobutene and normal butene comprising feeding the mixed  feed stream (11) to a distillation column reactor into a feed  zone at the lower end of a distillation zone, and methanol into  the upper end of said distillation reaction zone, which is  packed with a properly supported cationic ion exchange resin,  contacting the c₄ feed and methanol with the catalytic distilla­ tion packing to react methanol and isobutene, and concur­ rently fractionating the ether from the column below the  catalytic zone (24) and removing normal butene overhead (12)  above the catalytic zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a new catalyst system for conducting catalytic chemical reactions wherein separation of materials in the reaction mixture, i.e., product(s), by-product(s) or starting material(s) may be obtained by concurrent distillation or fractionation thereof. specific application of the present invention is the separation of isoolefins from streams containing mixtures of an isoolefin and the corresponding normal olefin. the present invention is especially useful for the separation of isobutene from streams containing n-butenes. one species of the present invention relates to the preparation of methyl tertiary butyl ether from streams containing mixtures of an isobutene and normal c₄ olefin. the present invention is especially useful for the separation of isobutene from streams containing n-butenes. isoolefins of 4 carbon atoms are difficult to separate from the corresponding normal olefin by simple fractionation because of the closeness of their boiling points. in prior art processes as generally practiced commercially, the isoolefin is selectively absorbed by sulfuric acid and the resulting isoolefin-containing sulfuric acid extract is then diluted and heated or treated with steam to separate the isoolefin. isobutene and diisobutene are of significant value having diverse applications, for example, isobutene is one of the comonomers for butyl rubber and diisobutene is an intermediate in the preparation of detergents. the n-butenes are required in pure form for homopolymerization and as feeds for the oxidative production of butadiene. one manner of separating these components is to pass the mixture through what is called a cold acid extraction procedure wherein the stream is fed into a bath of concentrated sulfuric acid. separation is achieved by virtue of the solubility of the isobutene in the sulfuric acid, the n-butenes and other hydrocarbons present passing overhead. in an improved process reported in u.s. pat. no. 3,531,539 to tidwell, the c₄ feed stream containing isobutene was contacted with a molecular sieve at an elevated temperature and under sufficient pressure to maintain a liquid phase, wherein the isobutene is converted to diisobutene which is easily separated from the stream by conventional separation techniques. methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe) has gained a wide acceptance as a non environmentally harmful octane improver for gasolines. one method of separating isobutene or isoolefins in general from mixtures with the corresponding normal olefins and alkanes, has been to etherify the isoolefin with a c₁ to c₆ primary alcohol in the presence of an acidic cation exchange resin catalyst, separate the low boiling hydrocarbons from the higher boiling ether by fractionation, frequently followed by decomposition of the ether to recover the isoolefin. such procedures are disclosed in u.s. pat. nos. 3,121,124; 3,270,081 and 3,170,000. more recently, in view of the ether octane improving characteristics, similar processes have been disclosed for preparing and recovering the ether, e.g., u.s. pat. nos. 3,726,942 and 3,846,088. in a variation on these processes disclosed in u.s. pat. nos. 3,629,478 and 3,634,534 to haunschild, the mixture of isoolefin and normal olefin with lower primary alcohols is fed to distillation column in which there are a plurality of zones of
