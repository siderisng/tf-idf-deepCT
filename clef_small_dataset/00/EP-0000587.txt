<ABSTRACT>
epoxy resin compositions based on epichlorohydrin/bisphenol  a and their production from specific formulations  of readily available constituents by amine-adduct hardening  in the absence of certain harmful catalysts are disclosed.   the products exhibit great stability and minimal  shrinkage over a long period of time and are particularly  well-suited as impact resistant surfacing materials for various  building structures of large area subject to high mechanical  stress and wear.  the use of special modifications of  these compositions is described for repairing and resurfacing  concrete and asphalt surfaces, as a heavy duty paving  material, as a joint filler for asphalt and concrete and as a  durable paint for marking highways, factory floors and similar  surfaces.
