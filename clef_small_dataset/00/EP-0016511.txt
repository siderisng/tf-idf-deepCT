<ABSTRACT>
a float operated electrical switch assembly has a housing  (10) fitted to an opening in a container wall (13).  a float (18)  follows the liquid level and is pivoted with a primary magnet  (17) about a pivot axis (16).  a secondary magnet (20) acts in  repulsion with the primary magnet (17) through a non-­ magnetic wall (19) of the housing (10).  the movement of the  secondary magnet (20) is sensed opticaily by means of a  shutter (46) which is carried by the secondary magnet (20) and  moves between positions in which it is clear of or obstructs a  light path between the ends of two fibre optic conductors  (28,30) or (29,31) in the housing (10).  these fibre optic conduc­ tors lead to and from a light source (44) and photo-sensitive  device (45) at a remote location.  a digital electrical signal is  therefore produced in dependence upon the position of the  float (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
float operated electrical switch assembly. the invention is concerned with a float-operated electrical switch assembly, for use with a boiler or other liquid container. the assembly has a float which follows the liquid level and is mounted with a primary magnet on the wet side of the assembly so that the primary magnet moves upon movement of the float. the primary magnet controls the movement of a secondary magnetic member by magnetic influence through a non-magnetic wall. the secondary magnetic member is mounted on the dry side of the assembly and its movement controls an electrical output from the assembly. such an assembly is hereinafter referred to as of the kind described. in conventional assemblies of this kind, the secondary magnetic member, which may be a permanent magnet acting in attraction drrepulsion with the primary magneto or a member of ferranagnetic material, controls directly the operation of electrical switch contacts, for example by magnetic attraction of a contact carrier the provision of the electrical contacts provides the major problem in such switch assemblies. thus the magnetic interaction provides only limited contact pressure between the switch contacts, the switch contacts surfaces can be contaminated with dust or atmospheric pollution, and the presence of electrical contacts immediately adjacent to a liquid container necessitates the use of intrinsically safe circuits or explosion proof housings for the switch contacts in many applications where inflammable gases or liquids are present. in applications other than float-operated electrical switch assemblies, it is known to use for sensing purposes light transmitting fibre optics which pick up light at positions or to an extent depending upon the parameter being sensed. however proposals for use of fibre optics in liquid level sensing systems have notbeen satisfactory as they have invariably involved transmission of light within the liquid container. this has involved difficulties of mounting the fibre optics, and possibly also a light source and/or a differentially reflecting surface within the container, particularly if the container is pressurised or contains a hazardous liquid. other difficulties arise because df contamination of light transmitting, receiving, or reflecting surface of the çtir system by deposit from the liquid in the container. in accordance with the present invention, a switch assembly of the kind described is characterised by a housing in which the secondary magnetic member is mounted and in which the ends of at least one pair of light guides terminate with the end faces of the pair of light guides facing one another across a gap, one of the pair of light guides being associated externally of the housing with a light source and the other of the pair of light guides leading externally of the housing to a photo-sensitive device such that light originating from the light source can be transmitted from the end face of the one light guide-across the gap onto the end face of the other light guide and transmitted therealong to the photo-sensitive device; and the secondary magnetic member having a part which moves, upon movement of the
