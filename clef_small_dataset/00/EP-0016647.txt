<ABSTRACT>
a plasma ignition plug intended for use in association  with a cylinder of an internal combustion engine and  includes a body 11 containing a plasma medium flow system  15, 17 (27) said system comprising a cavity 15, a recess 17  (27) which communicates with the cavity 15 and from which,  in use, plasma medium is forced into the cavity 15 by the  piston of the engine during its compression stroke, an orifice  16 in the wall of the cavity, first and second electrodes 13, 14  between which, in use, a spark is struck in the cavity 15 to  generate plasma in plasma medium contained in the cavity  15, said plasma issuing, in use, from the cavity 15 by way of  said orifice 16, and, a conduit 19 in said body whereby  plasma medium is supplied, in use, to said flow system.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to ignition plugs particularly but not exclusively for use in internal combustion engines. for some time the desirability of operating an internal combustion engine using a fuel/air mixture weaker that that which is currently considered to be usual has been recognised. however, it has also been recognised that a problem exists in igniting and ensuring efficient combustion of a weak mixture. successful combustion of weaker mixtures requires increased rates of flame propogation within the mixture and this in turn requires more effective ignition than can be provided by conventional spark discharge ignition plugs. it has been suggested that the ignition and combustion of a weak mixture can be improved by using a plasma jet or stream of radicals, free atoms and/or other excited species as the ignition source, and such a concept is disclosed in an article in the magazine "nature" volume 272 no. 5651 pages 341-343 march 23rd 1978. this article discloses also /palasma ignition plug used for experimental purposes. this disclosed plug has a small cavity bounded in part by electrodes between which an electrical spark is struck to generate plasma from the medium in the cavity. the cavity is filled with the plasma medium, prior to striking the spark, by way of a feed capillary and the plasma generated in the medium issues as a jet from the orifice of the cavity. the plug described in the aforementioned article is designed for use in conjunction with a test chamber filled with air/fuel mixture at atmospheric pressure, and is unsuitable for use in an internal combustion engine. firstly the generation of plasma in a medium compressed during the compression stroke of the engine requires a reduced electrode gap and moreover a smaller cavity would be required if, for a spark of the same energ, the temperature of the plasma is to be maintained in the much denser (by virtue of the compression) plasma medium. the use of a smaller cavity, probably less than 3 cubic millimeters, makes it extremely difficult to provide a supply system and supply capillary having a volume negligible by comparison with that of the cavity and so during compression the plasma medium in the cavity would be forced back out of the cavity into the supply system. even in the event that this reverse flow during compression does not occur the medium will be compressed in the cavity so that assuming an engine of normal compression ratio, at the end of the compression stroke the medium originally filling the cavity will have been compre-ssed to approximately 10% of its original volume -the remainder of the cavity being filled with the air/fuel mixture of the engine charge. in a previously proposed plasma plug for an internal combustion engine the plasma cavity was filled by the action of the engine piston with compressed weakair/fuel mixture from the cylinder by way of the cavity orifice. thus the plasma medium was the weak air/fuel mixture itself and this proved not to be such a satisfactory
