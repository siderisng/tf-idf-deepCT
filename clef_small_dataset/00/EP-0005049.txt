<ABSTRACT>
a device for connecting a rope to a support comprising a  hook (10) of u-shape configuration having a pair of parallel  limbs (11, 12) one (11) of which is longer than the other (12).   the long limb (11) has an upper aperture (13), which has a  v-shaped lower portion, and a lower circular aperture (14).   the short limb (12) has a circular aperture (15), at least a  portion of which is located below the upper aperture (13) in  the long limb (11).  when an end of a rope (16) is threaded through the  aperture (15) in the short limb (12), through the upper  aperture (13) of the long limb (11) and through the lower  aperture (14) in the long limb (11) and a tensioning force is  applied to the rope (16), the rope (16) becomes wedged in the  v-shaped portion of the upper aperture (13) of the long limb  (11) and the hook (10) is moused.  the hook (10) is suitable for suspending a fender (17)  from a guard rail (19) of a maritime vessel or for generally  securing a load to a support by means of a rope.

<DESCRIPTION>
a device for connecting a rope to a support this invention relates to a device for connecting a rope to a support. it is common practice to use rope for connecting an article to a support, the rope being in tension whilst in use. one such use is the suspension of a fender from a guard rail of a maritime vessel so that the fender is located adjacent a portion of an outer side wall of the vessel to prevent the portion from contacting another object. while the fender is suspended from the guard rail, the portion of the rope between the guard rail and the fender is in tension. another such use is with a covering for a load of a truck. the covering is connected to a rail of the truck and tension is applied to the rope to ensure that the covering is firmly secured to the truck before the rope is finally secured to the rail. it is generally necessary to adjust the rope after initially securing it to the rail. adjustment of a rope can be a difficult and timeconsuming operation, especially when the rope is wet, because it is necessary to pull a portion of the rope with one hand while untying with the other hand a knot securing another portion of the rope to the rail. the invention as claimed is intended to provide a remedy. it solves the problem of having to pull a portion of a rope while untying a knot securing another portion of the rope by ensuring that the rope is wedged whereby tension in the rope is maintained while the knot is tied or untied with both hands. the advantages offered by the invention are that the hook provides means for connecting a rope to a support and for enabling adjustment of the rope easily to be carried out and the hook is moused by the rope thus reducing any risk of the hook becoming dislodged from a support rail. in this specification, the term 'rope' includes hemp, manilla and synthetic fibrous material having resilient characteristics. following is a description, by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawing, of one method of carrying the invention into effect. in the drawing: figure 1 is a perspective view of a hook in accordance with the present invention and a rope of a fender attached thereto, the hook being shown in a stowed position, figure 2 is a perspective view of the hook mounted on a support, showing assembly of the rope of the fender thereto, figure 3 is a perspective view of the hook mounted on the support showing the fender in a selected position, and figure 4 is a perspective view of the hook showing the rope of the fender in a secured position. referring now to the drawing, there is shown a hook 10 of substantially inverted u-shape configuration, the hook being of plastics material and having a pair of parallel limbs 11, 12, the

claims:   1. a device for connecting a rope to a support comprising:  a hook member adapted to engage the support, the hook member having an aperture adapted to receive the rope therethrough and the aperture having a tapering portion, and  means for applying tension to the rope when the rope extends through the aperture  so that tension in the rope causes the rope to wedge in the tapering portion of the aperture thereby to secure the rope to the hook member.   2. a device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the hook member is of substantially inverted u-shape configuration having a pair of limbs, the said aperture being located in a first of the limbs.   3. a device as claimed in claim 2 wherein the said means comprises a first additional aperture located in a second of the limbs so that when the rope extends through the said aperture and the first additional aperture, the hook member is moused.    4. a device as claimed in claim 3 wherein the said means comprises a second additional aperture in the  first of the limbs, both of the additional apertures being spaced below the said aperture in a longitudinal direction of the limbs and the tapering portion of the said aperture tapering towards the second additional aperture so that when the rope extends through the second additional aperture, the said aperture and the first additional aperture, tension in the rope causes tb rope to wedge in the tapering portion of the said aperture thereby to secure the rope to the hook member.   5. a device as claimed in claim 4 wherein the first of the limbs has a portion thereof extending in a longitudinal direction beyond the second of the limbs.   6. a device as claimed in claim 5 wherein the second additional aperture may be located in the said portion of the first limb.
