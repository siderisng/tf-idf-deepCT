<ABSTRACT>
in an electromagnetic reader for identification cards (1), in which data can be read off identification cards (1) which can be moved past or applied to the read head (9), via at least one read head (9) by means of hall generator or field plate, it is proposed, in order to increase the protection against forgery, that the information items of the identification card (1) are established by a perforated metal plate (2) of high permeability, the metal plate (2) being protected by a plastic sheath (4, 4') and, furthermore, for reading the identification card (1), one, a number of or several rows of read heads (9) are arranged on one side and, separated by a slot (8), a permanent magnet (10) or an electromagnet is arranged opposite to each read head (9).  by using the metal plate (2) having a very high permeability it is not possible to influence the data medium, for example by means of steel plates or other metals, which results in a high protection against forgery.  <image>
