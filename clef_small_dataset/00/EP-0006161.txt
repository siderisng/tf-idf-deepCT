<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for automatically generating photographic  pictures, such as 35 mm slides, includes a number of micro­ computer terminals at scattered locations, a central com­ puter at a location remote from these terminals and a pic­ ture producing device for creating photographic pictures  from computer generated data.  the microcomputer ter­ minals are each provided with a color display and input  keyboards for enabling the user to enter data.  the terminals  are programmed to generate and display in color a number  of standard graphical representations having certain vari­ able characteristics.  a particular representation and its  characteristics are entered by users through the terminal  input as answers to questions presented by the terminal.   the terminals are capable of modifying the display of a  graphical representation in response to user entries which  change the answers to the questions so as to create a final  set of answers.  when a graphical representation is com­ plete, to the satisfaction of the user, data representing  the user's final answers are transmitted from the terminal  to the central computer.  the central computer is pro­ grammed to generate data defining the raster points for  the standard graphical representations based on the data  representing the user's final answers.  these raster points  define a graphical representation with enhanced resolution  over that generated and displayed by the terminal.  finally,  the picture producing device creates photographic pic­ tures (slides) from the higher resolution raster point data  generated by the central computer.
