<ABSTRACT>
a valve for a pressurized fluid containing cylinder having a plunger (6) axially moving along a seating provided in a first hollow block member (2) suitable for connection of the cylinder to a consumer, said plunger (6) being opened by the connecting operation against the counteraction of a spring means (9).  in order to prevent the unauthorized refilling of the cylinder without disassembling of the valve (1), a second block member (5) closely cooperates with the first block member (2) and is provided with a shutter (12) which, after the first filling operation of the cylinder, is moved in a position which allows the exiting of the pressurized fluid from the cylinder but hinders the refilling of the same cylinder unless the valve (1) is completely disassembred.

<DESCRIPTION>
a valve for a pressurized fluid containing cylinder the in-:ention relates to a valve for a pres-urized fluid containing cylinder, said valve being of the type comprising a hollow block member connectable to the consumer and having an axial seating for accomodating a movable member fitted with a closure head within the cavity of said block member and a spring neans cooperating with said closure head for maintaining the latter in its normally closed position, said movable member being opened by connection of said block member to the consumer, or by a control handwheel. the conventional valves of this type are normally used also for refilling the cylinder by simply connecting the block member directly to the source: this involves the serious disavantage of affording such refilling operations to unauthorized persons, with the obvious drawblacks resulting therefrom. the invention as claimed is intended to provide a remedy. it solves the problem of how to design a valve for a pressurized fluid containing cylinder so constructed to make it impossible to refill a cylinder, except after complete disas= sernbling of the valve. the advantage offered by the invention are mainly that after the first filling, means making part of the valve are so displaced so as to avoid any possibility of direct connection of tbe source to the cylinder. one way for carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which: fig. 1 is a frarn--.entary longitudinal sectional view sho= wing the valve as a whole; and fig. ; 2 2 is an enlarged vie showing a detail of the sliding shutter. referring to the figures of the drawing, a valve - generally denoted at 1 - essentially comprises a first block member 2 provided with external thread 3 for the connection of a conventional device (not shown) for control and connection to a consumer, and a further external thread 4 to secure said block 2 to a conventional cylinder (not shown) having any pressurized fluid stored therein, and a second block member 5 closely associated with said first block member 2. block 2 has an axial plunger 6 provided with a seal 6' and head 7, the latter within a bore 8 of the first block and cooperating with a spring 9 resisted by a diaphragm 10, provided with peripheral passages 11 and held in place against a shoulder 8' of said bore 8. clamping of diaphragm 10 is provided by pressure of end portion 5' of block 5 screwed down at s 8" along the outer end of said bore 8. said spring 9 is calibrated to a sufficient predetermined value to ensure the required sealing of head 7 when valve 1 is disconnected from two device for control and connection to a consumer. diaphragm 10 is centrally bored for free axial sliding of a shutter, generally designated at 12, comprising a stem 13 provided at the end facing said head 7 with a flange 14

claims:   1. a valve for a pressurized fluid containing cylinder comprising a first hollow block member (2) connectable to the consumer and having an axial seating for accomodating a   mo      viable      ueniber    (6) fitted with a   first    closure head (7)   within    the   cavity    (8) of said first   blocx      swear    (2) and a first spring means (9)   cooperating    with said first head (7) for maintaining the latter in its normally closed position, said movable member (6) being opened by connection of said first block member (2) to said consumer, or by a control handwheel,  characterised in that it further comprises a second allow block member (5) closely cooperating with said   first    block member (2), a sli= ding shutter (12) interposed   between    said first (2) and se- cond (5) block members, a   second    spring means 21 for retai=   ning    said   stutter    (12) in its normally closed position,   and      retaining    means (20) not accessible fro the outside of said   valve      (i)    for temporariliy   retaining    said shutter (12) in its open position only during the first filling of said cy= linder.   2.   ss    valve as claimed in claim 1, in which a   diaphragm    (10)   provided    with passages (11) is interposed between said first (2) and second (5) block members, said   shutter    (12) compri-   sing    a stem (13) provided   with    a second head (15) and axial   ly    sliding through said diaphragm (10), and an element (20) associated with said   stem    (13) for initially and   tenporari    maintaining said second head (15) at opening position said associated element (20)   bein-    removable for forcibly acting on said stem (13) in the closing direction of said second head   (15).        3. a valve as claimed in claim 2, in which said element (20) associated with said stem (13) is conveniently a fork element removably cooperating with a circumferential groove (19) in said stem (13), or an equivalent breakable means, dais fork element   0),    or said   brea1a'    means, being positioned at a sufficient spacing   from      said    second head (15) to maintain the latter   at    open position   or      te    initial   an    temporary engagement of said element (20)   with    said   diaphragm    (10).   4. a valve as claimed in claim 3, in which said stem (13) is aligned   with    said first head (7), so that an intended   proton    ged stroke of said movable   me oar    (6) carrying said first head (7) causes   a    forced axial   displacement    of the stem (13) and resulting disconnection of said fork element (20) from the associated groove (19) or the breakage of said   equiva    lent breakable means.    5.a valve as claimed in   claim    1 , in   which      means    are provided for   inhibiting    or at least   moffing      troublesome    the disassem bling of said block members   (2,5)    or narking evident any un= authorized disassembling of the same block members.
