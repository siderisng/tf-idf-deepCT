<ABSTRACT>
position sensing apparatus comprising two coil ar­ rangements (10, 11) movable relative to each other, the  first arrangement (11) being a side-by-side array of elongate  coils defining a writing area (21) and the second coil  arrangement (10) being a single or multiple coil loose  coupled with the coils in the array.  the coils in the side-­ by-side array have phase-shifting units (12) between them  so that they give an output which is unambiguously phase-­ characterised dependent upon the position of the second  coil arrangement on the writing area in the direction of the  array.  two layers (11, 11,) of the elongate coils can  be provided so that the coils in one layer are at right angles  to those in the other to give "x" or "y" co-ordinate posi­ tioning.  the phase shift over the writing area may be less  than 360°, or greater than 360° with the use of an ambiguity  eliminating circuit.  the second coil arrangement (10) may  comprise two coils (10a, 10b) carried on a pen (30) and  spaced from the pen tip and connected so that indef­ initeness does not arise as the pen is tilted.  apparatus  according to the invention may have its output processed  for line transmission for stock ordering and accounting  purposes or for signature verification.

<DESCRIPTION>
position sensing apparatus this invention relates to position sensing apparatus of the kind comprising a first coil arrangement defining a co-ordinate direction and a second coil arrangement movable relative to the first coil arrangement in said co-ordinate direction wherein the two coil arrangements are electromagnetically coupled and output terminals are provided whereat a signal is produced which identifies the relative position of the coil arrangements. many forms of apparatus are known wherein the position of one component (frequently referred to as a "pen" or "cursor") can be identified relative to another component. such apparatus, depending on use, can be identified as data tablets, signature verifiers, line tracers, chart readers, co-ordinate locators etc. such apparatus can involve a diversity of technologies for example in gb-ps 1,310,683 a form of apparatus is shown in which pressure generated by a pen affects the contact position between two resistive sheets. in uos.po 2,925,467 a conducting stylus functions as a movable contact on a resistive tablet uosopo 3,626,483 discloses a sonic arrangement. gb-ps 982,008 has contact sheets on which a pen can write, the sheets being separated by an oil film. other devices, such as shown in gb-ps 1,306,040 (which cross refer to uosope 2,988,643 and uoso 3,135,857 showing optical systems) use mechanical servo arrangements. laser systems are also known. from this complexity of technologies apparatus which is highly sensitive, structurally robust, stable, relatively inexpensive, and free of movable parts other than that of the pen or cursor, does not arisen for apparatus to have this specification one looks to electromagnetic devices and reference is made in this respect to the disclosure of gb-ps 1,304,376 and 1,350,113 in the name of the bendix corpora tion. these specifications disclose an "x", "y" co- ordinate axis system in which, for each axis there is, at one level, a single conductor providing a plurality of equally spaced long parallel portions and at another level a similar single conductor known as a "quadrature conduc torso thus, for both "x" and "y" axes there are four conductors at various levels and these define a tablet area which can be traversed by a pen or cursor inthe form of a coil which is related in size to the spacing of the parallel portions of the conductors and which must be close coupled with the conductors, although with four. layers, this can introduce problems. in use of this system it is thought to be essential to move the pen always from a set; zero position. if the pen is placed at random on the board an ambiguous reading of position would be obtained. this system is also believed to involve problems with "neutralising" the effects of the return wire from the end of the single conductor to the source which energises the conductor. the present invention provides improved position sensing apparatus of the kind stated in which construction is simplified, which can operate with loose coupling is free of ambiguity and is highly sensitive advantages which arise from use of the present
