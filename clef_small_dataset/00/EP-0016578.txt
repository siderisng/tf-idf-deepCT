<ABSTRACT>
a colorimetric method for determining the concentra足 tion of aldehyde release biocides when present in aqueous  systems (e. g.  oil-water emulsions used in metal working)  which can be carried out by personnel unskilled in chemical  analysis, comprises subjecting a dilute sample of the aque足 ous system to a mbth test procedure for determination of  aldehydes, and matching the colour developed, either  when viewed through a yellow filter or in the presence in the  sample of a yellow colouring agent with a colour scale  showing the relationship between the colours obtained by  the method, to a series of samples containing known con足 centrations of biocide.  the invention includes apparatus for carrying out the  method, e. g.  a kit containing suitable quantities of the reag足 ents (1,2) devices for measuring out small quantities of the  reagents (4, 5, 6) and a colour chart (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus and method for the determination of rtoctur concfnr?lratton in aqueous systems the present invention relates to a colorimetric method for the determination of aldehyde release biocides when present in aqueous systems, and to apparatus for carrying out the method. aldehyde release biocides are known and this type of biocide is commonly used to suppress the growth of micro-organisms in aqueous systems. it is not known whether the biocidal activity results from the liberation of an aldehyde by slow chemical release or whether the biocide molecules are able to donate aldehyde by some other reaction, to produce the biocidal activity. for this reason, the aldehyde release biocidesare considered to include biocides which are aldehyde donors. for convenience only the term aldehyde release biocide is used in this specification. the aldehyde released by such biocides is usually formaldehyde. some examples of biocides of this type are those sold under the trade marks grotan, grotan bk, bodoxin, cinon, vancide th, tris nitro and giv-gard dxn. typically these biocides are formed by a condensation reaction between formaldehyde and an amine, for example monoethanolamine or ethylamine. aqueous systems in which biocides of this type are used are, for example, soluble oil/water emulsions or synthetic water based fluids. the aqueous systems are used in metal cutting, grinding, rolling and forming processes or as water based hydraulic fluids in mining, die casting and steel pressing operations. the presence of the biocide maintains the performance and prolongs the effective life of the system. to be effective in the control of micro-organisms the concentration of the biocide present in the system must be maintained at least at a minimum which is effective in inhibiting growth of contaminant micro organisms. on the other hand, since these biocides function by the release into the system of an aldehyde, usually formaldehyde, the maximum concentration should be carefully controlled in order to minimise any health hazard to the operating personnel due to the build up of the aldehyde. aldehydes, and in particular formaldehyde, are recognised allergenic agents. for example, concentrations of formaldehyde in excess of 1000 parts per million are thought to present a potential health hazard to non-sensitive and healthy individuals, (epstein arch. derm. 1966.94.186). it is common practice on the shop floor to add biocide to the aqueous system without regard to the concentration which is actually present. attempts have been made to devise a method for the rapid determination of biocides in aqueous systems of this type which is suitable for use by shop floor factory personnel. for example, uk patent specification 1500850 describes a method of determining the biocide concentration of a liquid containing an aldehyde release biocide which comprises mixing a sample of the liquid, aqueous strong acid solution and a modified schiff's reagent, and observing the colour developed. a kit for carrying out this method is also described. however, the schiff's spot test for aldehydes has certain known deficiencies which may lead to inaccurate results, and, in addition, a relatively long period of time is required
