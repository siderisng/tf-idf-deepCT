<ABSTRACT>
a decontamination machine comprises a first assembly  including a vertical post (12) and a carriage track (13) with a  movable carriage (14) thereon, the carriage track (13) being  pivotally secured to the upper end portion of the post (12) so  that the assembly can be collapsed to a size permitting entry  into the channel head (1) through a manway (6), with the  assembly being sufficiently light in weight to permit its instal­ lation in the channel head (1) by no more than two individuals.   the machine includes a horizontal support beam (20) and a  curved track (23) which are separably secured to the vertical  post (12) and to the outer end of the carriage track (13) so that a  generally quadrantally shaped frame is provided.  the car­ riage track (13) carries an adjustable decontamination blaster  means (26).  means are provided for moving the carriage  along the carriage track (13) and for swinging the carriage  track (13) both horizontally and vertically in the frame so that  the decontamination means (26) has the capability of sweep­ ing past substantially all of the interiorly facing walls in the  channel head (1).  decontamination by remote operation becomes possible  with this machine.
