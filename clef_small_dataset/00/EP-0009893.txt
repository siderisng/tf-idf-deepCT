<ABSTRACT>
a surgical safety device to be fixed externally to the  body of a patient fitted with a body tube for securing the  body tube against unintentional displacement into or out  of the patient, comprises a bore (3,5) for receiving the  tube, an element (6) for gripping the tube, and means (1,2)  for selectively adjusting the element (6) between a tube  gripping position and a tube released position.  as shown,  two tubular members (1,2) are partially telescoped together  and the gripping element (6) has its opposite ends (7,8)  fast with the respective members for strips (11) of the ele­ ment to be wound spirally around the tube in response to  relative rotation of the tubular members (1,2).  a ratchet  system (12,13) serves to lock the members (1,2) in the tube  gripping position.  a method of securing a surgical body tube is charac­ terised by the steps of passing the body tube through the  bore (3,5) of the safety device, adjusting the safety device  to grip securely the body tube without collapsing it, and  fixing the safety device to the external body surface of the  patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
surgical safety device this invention is concerned with surgical equip ment and method, used in hospitals. more particularly the invention relates to a safety device for use with body tubes and to a method of securing a body tube using a safety device. in the treatment of patients it is not uncommon for tubes to be inserted into the body of a patient, either through an existing body orifice or an opening specially provided. such tubes are referred to generally as body tubes and specific examples of such tubes include catheters or cannulae used for blood or other admillir,tra- tion purposes, drainage tubing introduced into#bady cavities, especially after operations, for draining off fluids, and naso-gastric tubes. it is normal practice for body tubes to be secured to the patients skin outside of the body in order to avoid any inadvertant displacement of the tube either into or out of the body such securement is, in some cases, achieved simply by means of a strip of adhesive tape whereas in other cases a bandage may be used. it is especially important that drainage tubes, for example inserted through wounds into thoracis or abdominal cavities, should be securely held against un intentional movement either into the body or out of it. different tecllniques have been used for this purpose and include stitching tic tubing to the skin of the patient at a location whcre it energies through the wound, wrap ping a thread stitched to the patient around tllc tubing several times to grip and hold tlie tubing, and attaching a safety pin to the patients skin by loops of thread and then pushing the safety pin laterally through the tube wall. these knows methods have several disad vantagcs, but the main drawback is that adjustments of the surgical drains, for example by shortening the length of tube located within the body, are difficult and time consuming because of the manipulations required, and as a result can be painful to the patient. the fact that there is not a standard technique used by all surgeons who instead are guided by personal preferences does not ease the tasks of nurses who have to perform adjustments later. the present invention aims at providing a solution to the problems associated with securing body tubes and broadly resides in a tubular device, to be fixed e#xternally to the body of a patient fitted with a body tube, the body tube passing through the device which is adjustable either to grip the tube securely or to release the tube to allow the tube to be pulled freely through the device. the adjustment of the device may be a simple operation, for example relative rotation or axial movement of two tubular parts making up the device, which, when the device is fitted to a drainage tube for example, facilitates any necessary re-positioning of the tube which is achieved simply by adjusting the device to release the tube, pulling the tube through the device to the new position, and

   claims         t.    a surgical safety device to be fixed externally to the body of a patient fitted with a body tube (t), characterised by a through bore (3,5) for receiving the body tube (t), a gripping element (6) for gripping the body tube (t) received in the bore, and means   (1,2)    selectively operable to adjust the gripping element -(6) between a first position in which the body tube   (t)    is firmly gripped and held against longitudinal move   ment    through the safety device to prevent unintentional displacement of the body tube into or out of the patient,   and a    second position in which the body tube (t) is   released    by the gripping element (6) to allow the body tube (t) to be pulled freely through the safety device.      2.    a safety device as claimed in claim   1,    for use with a body tube having a flexible wall,   wherein    the gripping element (6) is adapted to engage the body tube   (t)    over an extended longitudinal portion thereof so as to grip the body tube secure-ly without collapsing the body tube.   3. a safety device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the said adjusting   means    comprises a pair of   tubular    members (1,2) telescoped together to define the through bore (3,5) and movable relative to each   other1    the gripping element (6) being adjustable   between    the first and second   positions    by relaticly moving the tubular members in a predetermined manner.     4. a safety device as claimed in claim 3# wherein the tubular members (1,2) are rotatable relative to each other about the axis of the through bore   (3,5f    for adjusting the gripping element   (6)    5. a safety device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the gripping element (6) is elongated and flexible, and has its opposite ends (7,8) fast for rotation with the respective tubular members   (1,2),    6. a safety device as claimed in claim 5, wherein the gripping element (6) includes a plurality   9f    strip (11) spaced apart around the periphery of the bore   (3,5)    and integrally attached to each other at the ends   (7,8)    of the gripping element, the strips,   (ii)    extending longitudinally of the bore in the second position and spirally about the bore axis and the body tube (t) in the first position.   7. a safety device according to claim 4, 5 or 6, including locking means (12,13) normally permitting relative rotation of the tubular members (1,2) in one direction only, which direction is in the sense to tighten the grip on the body tube, the locking means (12,13) being releasable to permit relative rotation of the tubular members (1,2) to release the body tube (t).   8. a safety device according to claim 7,   wherein    the locking means comprises a ratchet system including cooperating teeth (12,13) on the tubular members (1,2).      9. a safety device according to claim 8   wherein    the cooperating ratchet teeth (12,13) are axially opposed and are   disongageable    by pulling the tubular   members    apart axially.   10. a method of securing a surgical body tube fitted to a patient externally of the patient, characterised by the steps of providing a tubular safety device having a through bore (3,5) capable of receiving the body tube and selectively adjustable to grip frictionally the body tube received in the bore or to release the body tube, passing the body tube   though    the bore (3,5) of the safety device, adjusting the safety device to grip securely the body tube   without    collapsing the body tube and closing its interior passage, and fixing the safety device to the external body surface of the patient.
