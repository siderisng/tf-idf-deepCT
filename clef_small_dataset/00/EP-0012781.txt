<DESCRIPTION>
background of the inv2ntion alternately expanding and contractinf chambers are well known in the art, which devices employ various forces or rings or sliding surface to achieve sealing between adjacent parts. commonly known is the piston-type combustion engine @@@@@@ employing a closed cylinder, in which a piston ###### ## a crankshaft and connecting rod, provides an alternately expanding and contracting chamber. similarly, the well-known wanker engine utilizes scraping edge seals between the rotating piston and chamber inner surfaces by which the gases are compressed and expanded. obviously, such apparatus result in substantial friction between the contacting components thereby causing wear. in an attempt to avoid these continually aaring seals or rings between moving parts, rotary engines have been proposed in u.s. patents 1,349,882 and 2,097,881. the earlier patent employs four elliptical pistons between which the narrow spaces are sealed by spring-actuated rollers in the latter patent, four elliptical rollers are in contact to define' a combustion chamfer therebetween. the problem wlt the aforesaid designs is their limitation because of the number of pistons or rollers as well as their shapes. precise synchronization is required between the rotating and non-cylindrical rotors or pistons which is a signiricant disadvantage in apparatus design, as well as limiting the compression ratio of the chamber. summary of the invention the apparatus c the present invention utilizes at least one pair of rotating cj c,Â¯ ical members or rollers which aremaintaned in co@@i rolling contact with one another and with two opposite side walls, and which walls are preferably adjustable so as to maintain contact with the respective rollers and force them to make contact wit each other, thereby compensating for any wear. this contact between the rollers and the side walls, which is continuous and held firmly, and preferably substantially along the entire roller lengths, obviates the necessity of seals and at the same time minimizes frictional wear, thus, greatly increasing the longevity of the apparatus and reducing the incidence of repairs. the apparatus provides at least one alternately expanding and contracting chamber sealed and defined between the rollers and the housing means. the cavity may be used for treating gases; liquids or slurries. thus, use of such apparatus may be for engines, pumps, motors, compressors, valves and other power transfer devices and the like. the apparatus is not only a significant improvement because of its relative simplicity of design and reduction in operating costs and repairs but is economically manufactured because of the small number of parts as compared to the devices that require rings, seals, valves, and attendant operating components. the apparatus of the invention -also achieves improved economy of performance and maintenance because the rolling action of the rollers themselves which seal the thamber require no lubrication of the roller wall or the major portion of the cavity surfaces. further, because of the reduction of individual parts in the apparatus, and because the chamber itself is defined between the end and side walls, and the rollers, substantial reduction in weight can be
