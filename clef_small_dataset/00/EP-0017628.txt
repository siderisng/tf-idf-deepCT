<ABSTRACT>
the invention is constituted by a pneumatic activating  device able to transform a straight movement into a rotary  movement, wherein the device is of a compact type and  comprises in reciprocal cooperation and coordination:   - a plurality of shafts or arms (22-23) located in the  piston-disks (19) and stretching towards the other  piston-disk (19), at least one shaft (22) per piston having  equipment (29-31) fitted to it,   - one single feed duct (15) for the two end chambers (18)   - and feed inlets (13-14) located near to each other  whereby at least one return spring (25-125) can be  included.

<DESCRIPTION>
description of the invention entitled: "pneumatic activating device" -in the name of massimo ca ssiwa ri in milan submitted on under tiro. the subject of this invention is a pneumatic device -causing activation by means of a rotary motion; to be more .precise, the invention concerns a pneumatic device able to bring about a rotary motion to be employed, for instance, to -activate valves or other apparatus. many devices are commercially available that produce -activation with a, rotary motion and use two opposed pistonswhich, through the action of a fluid, move with an alternate .straight, up-and-down movement in a cylinder. - this straight movement is transformed into a rotary movement by means of devices which may be a piston with a slotted link or a piston with a rack. the most frequent shortcoming of these devices, which comprise a pair of pistons having an alternating movement -in a cylinder, consists in the tendency of two pistons to lose their alignment or to swivel in the cylinder, with the - outcome that they seize up and/or damage the inner surfaces - of the cylinder, thereby impatrinq the good watertight seal ' -of the same. a further drawback, which often happens in these types of devices fed with a fluid, lies in the fact that the moving parts are hard to lubricate as the lubricant tends to be drawn away by the pressure of the fluid, with the outcome that the pistons may seize up in the cylinder. said devices- often involve the further shortcoming that a plurality of outside feed pipes has to be fitted so that the fluid can be introduced at one and the same time into the two chambers opposite the pistons so that the latter can be provided with the movement towards each other which is needed to transmit the rotary movement to the prinary shaft. nith reference to the foregoing the author has conceived and designed a pneumatic activating device providing a rotary motion, which can make use of the crank-and slotted link sys .tem or the rack system to transform a straight movement into a rotary movement, as said earlier. according to the invention the pistons have a plurality of guide shafts arranged perpendicularly to the disk which acts as a piston; the shafts of one disk are oriented to- - wards the other disk but are advantageously offset in res- .pect of the shafts of the disk towards which they are orient .ed. the shafts lie parallel to each other but, as said, are .advantageously staggered at different angles. - moreover, the shafts have different sizes, and one or more guide shafts can be used to transmit motion to a slot- - ted link or to a pin ton. according to the invention one or more springs may be .visualized as being located between the disk acting as a - piston and the corresponding end of the cylinder. according to a variant said springs can be envisaged as .being positioned between the disks acting
