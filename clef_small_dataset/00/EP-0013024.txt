<ABSTRACT>
an encoder for manually or automatically providing a  sequence of identifier signals and a decoder for same, in a  remote dictation system.  a pair of control lines (10, 10′ and 11,  11′) carry the identifier signals which are in part identical to  signals used to control dictation recording functions of the  remote recorder.  a sequential counter (31) and a matrix of  switches (32) provide an automatic sequence of signals to a  set of transistors (15--18) and diodes (19, 20, 22) which establ­ ish the control line voltages.  these devices are alternately  connected (70--75) to shift registers (61, 62) which accept  keyboard signals entered from a keyboard (60).  timing cir­ cuitry (65, 66, 68, 69, 99, 117) controls the shifting of keyboard  signals in and out of the registers.  a combination of com­ parators (150--153) and gates (170, 171) decode the control  line voltages and provide inputs to decoding (169, 172, 176)  and timing (191, 195) circuitry which provides a binary  number to a memory device (250).  the occurrence of special,  non-numerical, signals is detected by special gates (227, 237).   also shown is verification apparatus comprising a pair of  digital comparators (310, 325) which will prevent operation of  a recorder unless the identifler signal corresponds to a pre­ determined valid signal stored in a memory (311).
