<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to color extractor transparent (1a) for primary, mixed colors and the colors white and black for the exposure of a recording material, such as a photoresist layer, which has relief structures with corresponding lattice depths after the development at a plane-lying pegs. The color convertible transparent (1a) are generally negative in which the partial images (3, 4, 5, 6) in the respective primary color or mixed color are transparent and the out-of-the-art surfaces appear opaque. There are several methods for producing the color conversion transparent (1a) will be described. In a method, the template is opened with light of the complementary color to the desired primary color of the color excerpt on a photographic film and the resulting positively copied positively to a color extractive negative. In another method, the color extract stranspa is pent for a particular primary color by masking the color extract negative or two superimposed color extract negative with the color extract positive of the remaining colors including the negative for the Far Ben black (2) and white ( 1). In a further method, a template is sampled with a color scanner pixel, the color values ​​for the sampled pixels are stored in a downstream computer and the predominant color is calculated in each pixel as well as the color intensities. These values ​​then control an output element. EXAMPLE A LIGHT PICTRIBER, which records this value-terrible raster signal points on the color statements.
