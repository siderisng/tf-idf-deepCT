<ABSTRACT>
a starter motor for use on an internal combustion  engine, includes an electric motor 12 having a rotor shaft 13.   a lay-shaft 16 carries a pinion gear wheel 18 and is spaced  from the rotor shaft 16 but capable of being driven thereby.   an electromagnet 26, 28, 29 is provided to move the lay-shaft  16 transverse to its longitudinal axis relative to the rotor shaft  13 to move the pinion gear wheel 18 in use into and out of  driving engagement with the ring gear 24 of an engine.   adjacent the pinion gear wheel 18 is a part 42 having a  circular cylindrical surface coaxial with the pinion gear wheel  18 and of diameter equal to the diameter of the pitch circle of  the pinion gear wheel 18.  the surface of the part 42 abuts, in  use, a corresponding surface on a part 43 adjacent the ring  gear 24.  the surface of the part 43 is coaxial with the ring  gear and has a diameter equal to the diameter of the pitch  circle of the ring gear 24.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a starter motor, for use on an internal combustion engine, the starter -motor being of the kind including an electric motor having a rotor shaft, a lay-shaft carrying a pinion gear wheel, the lay-shaft being spaced from the rotor shaft and being driven thereby, and means whereby the lay-shaft can be moved transverse to its longitudinal axis relative to the rotor shaft to move the pinion gear wheel into and out of driving engagement with the ring gear of an engine. starter motors of the kind specified have been known for some years and although not widely used such motors have found applications in small capacity engines -such for example as motor cycle engi#nes. a problem found with starter motors of the kind specified is that of controlling the depth of meshing betwee#n the pinion gear wheel and the ping engine ring gear. gear teeth on meshing gears are a designed to engage atjpredetermined region of the tooth profile, for example in the region of the pitch circle diameter of the teeth. in a known starter motor the depth of meashing is controlled by abutment of a stop member on the frame of the starter motor with a part of the means for moving the lay-shaft. such a mode of controlling meshing depth can prove unsatisfactory inter alia in that inaccuracies can arise as a result of tolerance build up in the assembly of the starter motor, inaccuracies in the positioning of the starter motor relative to the engine ring gear and as a result of wear. it is an object of the present invention to produce a starter motor of the kind specified wherein the aforementioned disadvantages are minimised. according to the invention in a starter motor of the kind specified there is provided, adjacent the pinion gear wheel, a circular cylindrical surface which is coaxial with the pinion gear wheel and has a diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the pinion gear wheel said surface in use during operation of the starter motor abutting a corresponding circular cylindrical surface adjacent the ring gear, said corresponding surface being coaxial with the ring gear and being of diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the ring gear. desirably the surface is a surface of a part integral with the pinion gear wheel. the invention further resides in an internal combustion engine incorporating a starter motor as specified in anyone of the two preceding paragraphs, and having a ring gear and adjacent the ring gear a circular cylindrical surface coaxial with the ring gear and of a diameter equal to the pitch circle diameter of the ring gear. convenien#tly said surface is a surface of a part integral with the ring gear. one example of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein figure 1 is a diagrammatic part sectional view of a starter motor; figure 2 is a view similar to figure 1, with the section taken in a plane at right
