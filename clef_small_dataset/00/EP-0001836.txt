<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a groove spring connection with grooves and springs approximately approximately cone-trump-shaped cross section in the construction elements to be connected and with a clamping member (45) between this engaging member (45). The grooves and springs are only connected to each other with their flanks (23, 30), so that the force exerted by tensioning member (45) causes a friction of considerable size. If the tensioning member (45) is optionally solved by a simple handle, the construction elements (20, 26) can be easily separated from each other. Despite this reliability, the invention has a surprisingly large molding stiffness due to the friction of the flanks (23, 30) of the grooves and springs. The connection is well pressure-tight and in particular with additional sealing strips also waterproof. The applicability extends to the furniture and container construction, prefabricated house construction as well as individual components such as door, window and wall elements, further on cover, sealing and insulating elements as well as the area of ​​the line and tunnel construction.
