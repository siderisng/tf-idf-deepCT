<ABSTRACT>
a resinous polymeric substance for use as an aid in froth  flotation characterized by its mean molecular weight,  elemental analysis, viscosity and infra-red spectrum.  a  method of making the substance by reacting a carbonyl  compound with an amine or ammonia followed by heating;  and a method of froth flotation in which the substance is  used as an aid.  the substance has a mean molecular weight  in the range 250 - 10 000; it includes carbon, hydrogen,  nitrogen and oxygen; it has a viscosity of 10 000 to 100 000  centipoise at 20°c and 100 to 1 000 centipoise at 70°c; and it  has an infra-red spectrum including bands characteristic of  the groups -c=n-, >n-h and >c=c<.
