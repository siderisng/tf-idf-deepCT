<ABSTRACT>
a gelling composition useful for soil stabilisation com­ prises water, an alkali metal silicate, an ester, particularly an  alkyl alkanoate or one or more diesters of a c₂ to c₁₀ dibasic  alkanoic acid, and rosin or a rosin ester or salt or a rosin acid or  rosin acid ester or salt.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
silicate comtositions the present invention relates to an alkali metal silicate solution which is capable of forming a silica gel and to the use of such a solution in the stabilisation of the ground and similar applications. alkali metal silicate solutions may be converted to silica gels by the addition of a number of agents such as amides, acids, alcohols and esters. this property is put to good use in the stabilisation of unstable ground for building purposes by injecting into the ground a mixture of silicate solution and gelling agent which gels through the silicic acid to form a rigid silica gel. for this use esters are particularly valuable gelling agents because the gelling only takes place when the ester hydrolyses so there is an initial delay while hydrolysis takes place and this delay enables the silicate solution containing the gelling agent to be injected into the ground before gelling and subsequent hardening commences. among the esters which are commonly employed as gelling agents for silicate solutions are included alkyl alkanoates particularly esters of c1 to c6 monobasic alkanoic acids with c1 to c5 alkanols e.g. ethyl acetate, isopropylacetate and methyl propionate and the esters of dibasic alkanoic acids e.g. esters of oxalic, succinic, glutaric and adipic acids. these dibasic acid esters have a number of advantages as gelling agents e.g. their rates of hydrolysis are such as to provide the right gelling time for the silicate solutions under the commonly encountered ambient temperature conditions at which such solutions are used. we have found however that there is a tendency for esters, particularly dibasic acid esters to be only sparingly miscible with aqueous alkali metal silicate solutions so that phase separation may occur resulting in the injection of an inhomogeneous mixture into the ground which does not gel uniformly. we have however devised a composition which overcomes this difficulty and which we have found in addition to have superior gelling properties. according to the invention a gelling composition comprises water, an alkali metal silicate, an ester and rosin or a rosin ester or salt or a rosin acid or a rosin acid ester or salt. preferably, the ester comprises one or more diesters of a c2 to c10 dibasic alkanoic acid. the c2 to c10 dibasic alkanoic acids are oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic and sebacic acids and of these succinic, glutaric and adipic acids are preferred particularly as a mixture of two from the three e.g. glutaric and adipic acids, or all three together. the diester is preferably a diester of a c1 to c5 alkanol particularly the dimethyl or diethyl ester or mixed methyl/ethyl ester. rosin is a naturally occurring product comprising predominantly a mixture of so-called rosin or resin acids and although for economic reasons it is preferred to use rosin itself or a rosin ester or salt one or more of the rosin acids or rosin acid esters or salts may be used i.e. an abietic type acid e.g. abietic, levopimaric, neoabietic
