<ABSTRACT>
a tool bit retaining mechanism for a portable tool such as  a power hammer; drill or the like equipped with a nose piece  (23) including an axially extending longitudinal bore (29) for  receiving a tool bit therein, the tool bit retaining mechanism  including: a first opening (33) formed in the nose piece (23)  and disposed in relation to the axially extending bore (29)  such that it cuts through a portion of the bore (29); and, a tool  bit retainer pin (37) slideably disposed in the first opening  (33); the tool bit retaining mechanism characterized in that:  the retainer pin (37) has a first cutout (39) formed therein, the  cutout (39) being contoured such that for a first position of the  tool bit retainer pin (37) in the first opening (33), the cutout is  aligned with the axially extending bore (29) in the nose piece  (23) to define an uninterrupted clear-through opening to allow  insertion and removal of the tool bit an arrangement (45) for  urging the tool bit retainer pin (37) axially along the first  opening (33) such that the first cutout (39) is urged away from  cooperative alignment with the longitudinal bore (29); and, a  keeper (57) for holding the tool bit retainer pin (37) in the first  opening (33) in a fixed, second position in relation to the bore  (29), the shape and contour of the tool bit retainer pin (37) at  the second position cooperating with the shape and contour  of the tool bit so as to retain the tool bit in the nose piece (23) of  the portable tool.
