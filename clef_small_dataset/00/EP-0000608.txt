<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for the manufacture of copolymers which contain hydroxyl groups and are soluble in organic solvents by copolymerisation in organic solvents of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid, alkyl acrylates and optionally additional ethylenically unsaturated copolymerisable monomers while simultaneously esterifying with glycidyl esters of alpha-alkylalkane-monocarboxylic acids and/or alpha,alpha-dialkylalkanemonocarboxylic acids of the general formula c12-14 h22-26 o3 by heating in the presence of a polymerisation initiator, characterized in that a mixture a), consisting of an inert organic solvent and a) 10 to 45% by weight of the glycidyl esters is heated to a temperature in the range from 90 to 200 degrees c, and reacted with a mixture b), consisting of b) 2 to 15% by weight of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid, c) 5 to 25% by weight of the hydroxyalkyl acrylates and/or hydroxyalkyl methacrylates, preferably containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group d) 20 to 78% by weight of the alkyl acrylates and/or alkyl methacrylates, preferably containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, e) 5 to 30% by weight of unsaturated fatty acids with 11 to 22 carbon atoms and an iodine number of 90 to 240, optionally f) additional ethylenically unsaturated copolymerisable monomers, and g) 0 to 20% by weight, preferably 0 to 10% by weight of saturated fatty acids, the components a), b), c), d), e) and optionally f) and g) being employed in such quantities that their sum add up to 100% by weight.
