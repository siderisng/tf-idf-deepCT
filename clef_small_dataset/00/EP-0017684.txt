<ABSTRACT>
a hydraulic cylinder serving as a tilting unit for a pro­ pulsion unit of an inboard or outboard motor is pivotally  connected to the hull of a boat and its associated piston  rod is pivotally connected to the propulsion unit.  in order  to act as a shock absorber when the propeller strikes an  obstacle the piston (4) is formed with an oil hole (7) hav­ ing a check valve (8).  the effect of possible leakage  through the check valve (8) is overcome by the provision  of a disc valve (13) having two concentric annular elastic  sealing members and biased by a spring (14) against a  cover plate (17) formed with holes (18) and constituting  one face of the piston (4).  the space between the sealing  members is thus in communication with the end of the oil  hole (7) and the disc valve (13) thus operates in series  with the check valve (8) to prevent leakage of oil during  operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
hydraulic cylinder for a propulsion unit of an inboard or outboard motor in small craft such as motorboats, the propeller is. formed as part of a propulsion unit and the position of the propeller with respect to the hull may be operated by a hydraulic cylinder, which may also act as a shock absorber if the propeller strikes an obstacle when under way. the cylinder thus acts as a tilting unit for lifting the propeller when the boat is on land and for setting it at the most efficient angle, i.e. trimming it, when under way. in order to act as a shock absorber to prevent breakage when the propeller strikes an obstacle, an oil hole for generating a damping force needs to be formed in the piston of the cylinder forming the tilting unit and must be provided with a non-return or check valve. however, with the construction of cylinder described in u.s. patent no: 3,003,724 the check valve tends to leak while holding the propeller in the trimmed position while under way and therefore the set angle of the propeller will gradually vary. an object of this invention is to provide a hydraulic cylinder for the propulsion units of either inboard or outboard motors which does not suffer from this defect and which will provide a shock absorbing action with adequate damping force if the propeller strikes an obstacle. in accordance with this invention, a hydraulic cylinder for a propulsion unit of an inboard or outboard motor comprises an oil cylinder having an oil inlet and outlet port at each end and a piston fitting in the cylinder and having an oil hole fitted with a check valve and also including a disc valve having two concentric annular sealing members made of elastic material which is biased against one face of the piston so that the space between the two sealing members is in communication with the end of the oil hole whereby the disc valve may open and close the oil hole simultaneously with the check valve according to the direction of movement of the piston. the piston thus includes two valves arranged in series. the addition of the disc valve with its elastic sealing members prevents any leakage of oil during operation and the check valve controls the damping force under shock conditions. embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing a hydraulic cylinder according to the present invention as used in an outboard motor; figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view showing an embodiment of the present invention; figure 3 is a plan view of a disc valve shown in figure 1; figure 4 is a sectional view on line iv - iv in figure 2; figure 5 is a longitduinal sectional view to an enlarged scale of an alternative form of piston; figure 6 is a view similar to figure 4 of still another form
