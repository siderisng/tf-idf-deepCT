<ABSTRACT>
to produce scouring pads and the like a stencil 11 is  pressed against an open-cell foam sheet 10 so that the foam  projects through holes 12 in the stencil, a hardenable resin is  applied and upon removal of the stencil and hardening of the  resin forms dots embedded in the surface.  the foam can be  laminated to a fabric backing and the dots may be bonded to  the backing.  a thin thermoplastic film on the working surface  allows use of weak foam material without interfering too  much with the abrasive action.

<DESCRIPTION>
abrasive fox}5 material Ã¬d its method of preparation the invention relates to a foam polymeric material with an abrasive surface, which can be used1 for example, to make scouring and cleaning pads for domestic use, and to a method for producing the material. according to the invention in a first aspect there is provided a method for providing an abrasive surface on a sheet of a compressible foam polymeric material, comprising the steps of arranging a stencil having a multiplicity of holes against a surface of a sheet of a compressible foam polymeric material, applying pressure to the stencil to impress it into the sheet of foam material, applying a hardenable resin to the surface of the stencil remote from the sheet of foam. material, the resin contacting the foam material in the region of the holes in the stencil, removing the stencil and allowing or causing the resin in contact with the foam to harden. arding to the invention in a second aspect there is provided a sheet of compressible foam polymeric material provided with an abrasive surface, the abrasive surface comprising a multiplicity of distinct regions of hardened resin which is, at least in part, incorporated in the sheet. the resin is preferably incorporated into the sheet of compressible foam material in the region of the holes in the stencil and does not project from the surface of the sheet. the foam material is preferably of the "open-cell" type, i.e. a foam material in which neighbouring cells communicate with each other, and the resin, which can contain an abrasive substance, is preferably applied in such a way as not to fill the cells of the foam material. the resin coating thus hardens the cell structure in the regions in which it is incoi- porated but should not create a continuous hard surface which closes the cells at the surface. it is however likely to reduce commun.cati between the cells of an open foam structure in the region in which it is incorporated. since the body of the foam sheet remains unaltered it will absorb the cleaning fluid and supply ; to he hardened abrasive regions. hence the sheet of foam material is provided ^with a pattern of regions of hardened resin which do not adversely affect the flexi bility of the foam sheet. the resin, being impregnated in the foam material, is unlikely to become separated from the sheet of foam material. since the resin is applied in a multiplicity of distinct regions it is less likely to crack than if applied as a continuous superficial coating. the invention will be further described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which fig. 1 is a section through a sheet of compressible foam polymeric material and a stencil used in a method according to the invention; and fig. 2 is a section through the sheet of foam polymeric material shown in fig. 1 provided vith an abrasive surface by a method according to the

claims:    1. a method of providing an abrasive surface on a sheet of compressible foam polymeric material, comprising the steps of arranging a stencil having a multiplicity of holes against a surface of a sheet of a compressible foam polymeric material, applying pressure to the stencil to impress it into the sheet of foam material, applying a hardenable resin to the surface of the stencil remote from the sheet of foam material, the resin contacting the foam material in the region of the holes in the stencil, removing the stencil and allowing or causing the resin in contact with the foam to harden.    2. a method as claimed in claim   1    wherein the holes in the stencil are circular holes having a total area of between 25% and 60% of the total area of the stencil.    3. a method as claimed in claim   1. or    2, wherein the pressure applied to the stencil is sufficient to cause the foam material to project from the face of the stencil remote from the foam sheet.    4. a method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, in which the resin is hardened by heating of the foam sheet after removal of the stencil  5. a method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, in which the foam sheet is initially laminated with a fabric backing sheet and is of such thickness that the hardenable resin passes through the foam sheet and bonds to the backing sheet.    6. a method as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which after hardening of the resin a thin film of thermoplastic resin is   fuzed    to the surface of the sheet carrying the hardened resin regions.       a a method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, in    which the foam material is of the open-cell type.    8. a sheet of compressible foam polymeric material provided with an abrasive surface, the abrasive surface comprising a multiplicity of distinct regions of hardened resin in each of which regions the resin is at least partially incorporated in the sheet to coat the walls of the cells of the foam without filling all the cells with resin.     9. a sheet as claimed in claim 8, in which the hardened resin does not project from the surface of the sheet.         10. a sheet as claimed in claim 8 or 9, in which the regions    of hardened resin are circular dots covering an area of between 25% and 60% of the total area of the sheet.    11. a sheet as claimed in any of claims 8 to 10 laminated to a fabric backing sheet and having the hardened resin regions bonded to the backing sheet.    12. a sheet as claimed in any of claims 8 to 11 having a thin film of thermoplastic resin fused to the abrasive surface of the sheet.
