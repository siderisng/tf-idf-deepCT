<ABSTRACT>
Extruder for plasticizing plastic compositions, in particular for hollow body blown systems, are equipped with a locking in the extruder housing (10) and the adjoining cylinder tube (12) in the extruder housing (10) and the subsequent cylinder tube (12). This conveying screw (11) is then surrounded in connection with the filling opening (4) of the extruder housing (10) coaxially from a feedback sheet (1). When operating extruders in conjunction with hollow body blown systems, it is particularly important that independent of the consistency of the raw material, changes in the counterpressure, temperature fluctuations and son-stable influences in the time unit, an accurate raw material amount from the nozzle pressed and thus a constant Length of the plastic preform is guaranteed. The optimum plasticization of the various thermo plastic types is substantially dependent on the geometric shape of the conveyor screw (11) and the feedback may (1) together with this cooperative. For the change of the thermoplastic types, therefore, a change of the screw conveyor (11) and that of this associated feedbox (1) must be performed regularly. According to the invention, therefore, the extruder is intended to obtain a design which after removing the conveying screw (11) also allows a light and easy exchange of the feed bush (1). For this purpose, the a pulling sleeve (1) is inserted into a relative to the longitudinal axis of the conveyor screw (11) radially open recess (13) of the extruder housing (10) interchangeable and through passing surfaces (14 'and 14 ") or (15', 15 ") Held rotatably and coaxially with the longitudinal axis of the screw conveyor (11) by remote bundles (6 ', 6") and for this purpose suitable for adding surfaces (16 and 17) on the extruder housing (10).
