<ABSTRACT>
an unmanned vehicle capable of being automatously  guided towards a predetermined destination by the geometÂ­ rical computation of light signals received by at least two  on-board detectors which relate the direction of each signal  received to the axis of the vehicle.  useful in restricted areas  such as automatic warehouses and loading bays.

<DESCRIPTION>
driverless vehicle carrying directional detectors auto-guided by light signals this invention relates to an unmanned vehicle guided towards a goal particularly to a vehicle guided by light signals. driverless vehicles are in common use especially in automatic warehouses and many are guided along predetermined paths which are either wires embedded in the floor or light beams marking out the track to be followed. we now provide a navigation and guidance system which allows a roving automatic vehicle to be guided by means of on-board light sensitive detectors responsive to collimated beams of light emitted in all directions from stations of known position. according to the present invention we provide a vehicle capable of antomatous guidance towards a predetermined destination comprising at least two light sensitive detectors mounted on the vehicle and adapted to receive light signals from at least one fixed station having a known position relative to that of the predetermined destination, and a computer electrically connected to each detector capable of interpreting information from the detectors, the detectors and computer together being capable of characterising the light signals in terms of: : i) their direction relative to the axis of the vehicle and ii) their direction relative to a predetermined fixed axis and thereby from the interpretation of at least two noncollinear signals to relate the position of the vehicle to that of the destination, the computer being capable also of influencing the mechanical controls for the movement and steering of the vehicle in such a way that the vehicle is guided towards the destination. the light signals from the fixed station are preferably generated by means of a collimated beam or other suitable intense light source for example a laser or a xenon-flasher suitably backed by a parabolic-mirror. the light source is preferably constructed so that the collimated beam can sweep a horizontal circle synchronously with a device for imparting a directional code to the beam e.g. the device may be a gray-code disc which operates a pulse modulator so that the pulse frequency indicates the bearing of the beam transmitted and this coded information may be interpreted by the detectors on the vehicle. the light signals preferably carry this information, contained in coded form in the character of the light signal itself as described above giving the direction of the signal beam preferably with respect to a fixed axis for example a geographical compass bearing or an axis of the local system such as a main wall aisle or thoroughfare. the coded information contained in the character of a rotating light beam is preferably generated from a fixed light source surrounded by a shutter rotating about a vertical axis having a vertical slit aperture, the shutter rotating synchronously with a gray-code disc the code from the disc being fed to the power source for the light in order to put the pulse modulation or other character into the beam emitted. in this preferred system the detectors would be adapted to receive the rotating beam from any
