<ABSTRACT>
a transducer has a chamber (1) containing a substance  having a monitorable physical and/or chemical property, for  example electrical conductivity, which property changes in  correspondence with a change in an external influence, for  example, temperature.  in one embodiment, the chamber (1) is  of elongate form and changes in said monitorable property in  any part of the substance along the length of the chamber are  monitored by a detection means (4,5,6).  in a further embodi­ ment the substance is arranged to undergo an abrupt change  in the said property thereof, for example, due to a phase  change in the said substance, in response to a predetermined  change in the external influence, and detection means is pro­ vided to detect such abrupt change.
