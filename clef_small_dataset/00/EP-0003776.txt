<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a needle-shaped centring device for a magnetically supported rotating shaft (1) of a measuring device, in particular of an electricity meter, in which a thin centring needle (12), consisting of steel or another metal, protrudes into a needle guide (14) of a plastic having good wear and abrasion characteristics.  in the case of such a needle-shaped centring device, there is a problem in achieving a low abrasion and low wear guide of the rotating shaft (1) in a manner that is favourable from the production engineering point of view.  in this case, the precision of the guide and good cooling of the centring device are to be ensured, at the same time.  this problem is solved according to the invention in that the centring needle (12) is provided with a coating having good sliding characteristics, at least in the region interacting with the needle guide (14), the coating being designed as a sleeve (20) which can be mounted on the centring needle (12).  by means of the ability of the sleeve (20) to be mounted, the coating can be applied to the centring needle (12) or can be replaced, in the most simple manner (figure).  <image>
