<ABSTRACT>
a wire-feeding apparatus (10) for the controlled feeding  of wire (18) comprising a set of two opposed aligned rollers  (54, 56), one of said rollers (54) being a driven feed roller and  the other of said rollers (56) being a pinch roller, both of said  rollers (54.  56) having indented v-shaped peripheral cross  section (78, 88), said peripheral cross section (78) of said feed  roller (54) having a relatively sharp obtuse angle, said  peripheral cross section (88) of said pinch roller (56) having a  relatively shallow obtuse angle, said angles accommodating  a wide range of wire diameters (18a to 18f), said peripheral  cross section (78) of said feed roller (54) having a pair of  sloped walls (80), said walls (80) being serrated (82) to  facilitate gripping said wire (18), and resilient means (66)  urging said peripheral edges of said rollers (54, 56) together  for gripping said wire (18) between them.
