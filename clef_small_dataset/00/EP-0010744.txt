<ABSTRACT>
a package is provided for individual plastic membrane  discs (7) which makes it possible to remove the discs one at  a time without damage to the discs and without disturbing  other discs in the package, comprising, in combination, a  spirally wound roll (16) of at least two plies (2, 10) of sheet  material having facing surfaces to which the plastic mem­ brane discs do not adhere; and a plurality of individual  plastic membrane discs (7) interleaved between and sup­ ported upon the sheet material and spaced apart from each  other on the sheet material so that the discs can be removed  one at a time individually without disturbing adjacent discs.  a process is also provided for preparing packages of  this type, which comprises distributing the discs in spaced-­ apart relationship upon a surface to which the discs are not  adherent of one ply of sheet material (1); placing a second  ply of sheet material (10) having a surface facing the discs to  the discs are not adherent atop the first, so that the  discs are protectively sandwiched between the sheets; and  then spirally rolling up the two plies of sheet material to  form a roll package (16) with-the discs sandwiched between  the  sheets.  a protective container (30) for the roll can be provided,  with means permitting unrolling the two-ply sandwich a  little at a time, sufficient to expose and remove one disc at a  time, or more, as required.
