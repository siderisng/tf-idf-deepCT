<ABSTRACT>
a method of bonding together overlying regions of ther足 moplastic sheet using high frequency vibratory energy is pro足 vided in which sets of elongate energy directors (24,30) are  disposed between adjacent sheets (10,14,26) in an orientation  such that the director elements of one set (24) cross those of  the next adjacent set (30).  when a compressive force and the  high frequency vibratory energy are applied to the sheets, the  pressure and vibratory energy are concentrated in the regions  where energy directors cross so that the thermoplastic mater足 ial in those regions is first to soften.  by initially concentrating  the pressure and vibratory energy, the bonding time is sub足 stantially reduced and an even flow of melted material is  assured.
