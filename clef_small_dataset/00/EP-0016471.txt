<ABSTRACT>
Dosing device for a sanding system of a driving witness, in particular rail vehicle, with an outwardly largely tight sand supply container (1). By the bottom of the container, a sanding tube (8.11) projects in the container until under a bell in the container, which ends immediately before a vehicle wheel. The bottom of the container (1) is formed air permeable. At the bottom of the container (1), a supply air line (13) is connected in conjunction with a supply air line (13 "). An exhaust air line (5) whose open end lies in the sand substantially cleared upper part of the container is connected to the sand tube (8,11) at a distance from the bell (A). In the supply air line (13) is a supply air dosing device (13 ') and in the exhaust air line (5), an exhaust air dosing device (15.15') is switched on. By controlling the supply air and / or the exhaust air, the residual sub-bottom flow in the container (1) is adjustable, which flows as a dosing air flow for discharging a certain amount of sand per unit time via the bell (9) in the container (1) into the sand tube (8,11) . The supply air dosy cleaning device (13 ') consists of at least one adjustable nozzle (14) and the exhaust air dosing device (15') consists of at least one adjustable exhaust air nozzle (15). The exhaust air nozzle may be bridged from a controllable valve device (16; 20, 22, 20, 23, 22). The compressed air source may be formed by one or more compressors (41, 42).
