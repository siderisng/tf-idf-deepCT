<ABSTRACT>
a power assisted gear assembly in which a piston (3)  forms with its cylinder opposed chambers (4,5).  displacement  of the piston provides a steering output and such displacement  is effected by rotation of an input component (6) which  screw threadedly engages the piston (3).  two fluid systems  are provided with respective inlets (18,20) and with the chambers  (4,5) being located one in each fluid system.  a valve  (10,15,16) adjusted by the input component (6) when displacing  the piston (3) controls fluid flow through the two fluid  systems to an outlet (29) and such valve has a neutral condition  to which it is biased by springs (25,26) or by fluid pressure  in the fluid systems in which both fluid systems communicate  with the outlet (29) for an open centre system.
