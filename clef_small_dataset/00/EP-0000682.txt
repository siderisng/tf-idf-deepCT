<ABSTRACT>
1.  valve having a rotary member and an unrestricted passageway, comprising a body (1) which may be connected on two opposite sides to two conduits having the same axis, a rotary member (5) movable inside the said body by rotation about an axis perpendicular to the common axis of the conduits, the said rotary member being traversed by a port of section close to that of the conduits and rotatable from an open position where the port has substantially the same axis as the conduits to a closed position where the axis of the port makes with the axis of the conduits an approximately right angle, the body and the rotary member being provided with means for ensuring fluidtightness of the valve in the closed position, the rotary member carrying at least one plus (10) movable in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the rotation and an intermediate part (19) placed between the rotary member and the plug and movable relative to the rotary member, the body having an abutment (28) against which the intermediate part bears at the end of rotation, approaching the closed position, but does not limit the rotation of the rotary part which causes by the relative movement between these parts the change of the relative position of the plug from a rest position to an active position where the intermediate part exerts on the plug a force tending to move it away from the rotary member to ensure fluidtightness in the closed position, characterized in that the intermediate part comprises a slide which is slidable between the plug and the rotary member, which bears against the abutment during rotation of the rotary member and which has a cam surface for cooperation with a cam surface provided on the rotary member.
