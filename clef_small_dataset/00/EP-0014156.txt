<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for generating images in at least two colors comprising an image reproduction screen, means for directing an energizing electronic beam over the entire surface of said screen, the intensity of which beam is dependent on the amplitude of a brightness control signal, and means for imparting a scanning movement to the said energizing beam so that its point of impact on the surface of the screen moves according to two dimensions, the said image generating apparatus being characterized in that it further comprises : a) a superimposition of at least two layers (23-25) each one produced in a luminescent material radiating light of a predetermined wavelength, different from the wavelength of the light radiated by the other layers, the luminescent materials used, radiating light under the action of an electronic bombardment and adapting to an amplification of the light intensity thus radiated by superposition of an electroluminescent effect, b) an appropriate control device, associated to each luminescent layer to generate therein a pulsating electric field, the frequency and amplitude of which are dependent on the amplitude of a corresponding color signal so as to ensure the restitution of the different chromatic components, and c) generators (31, 32) supplying the said signals controlling the color and brightness.
