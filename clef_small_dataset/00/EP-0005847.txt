<ABSTRACT>
A written electrically programmable memory circuit as a solid memory is described in which a bistable tilting circuit (40) is stored for storing the programmed rating state of a device of the arrangement by means of a blocking transistor (33) which between the component and a node (A) of the tilting circuit It is turned on, wherein the control electrode of the locking transistor is connected to the other node (B) of the tilting circuit. If the tilting circuit is in its initial operating state in which the blocking transistor is conductive, then a signal generated by precharging can be derived via the device of the arrangement according to earth, indicating a first stored information state. By means of a write signal of as large amplitude that the bistable tilting circuit can be adjusted in its other operating state, up via the device of the arrangement and the blocking transistor, the locking transistor in his non-conductive state is overstabled, so that subsequent attempts , a signal over the component of the arrangement according to earth, are not feasible, whereby a second stored information state is displayed. This memory circuit is used as a memory cell in the architecture of a programmable logic arrangement, which requires only four additional terminal pins to the conventional screening form. This is achieved by two-time use of the output locking circuits of the OR area both for reading the arrangement and for programming the arrangement by the "scan-in" accidents. The cells in the AND area are programmed by a product expression programming register, which can be programmed by the product prints by input-side circuits with bit split.
