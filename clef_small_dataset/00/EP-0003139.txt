<ABSTRACT>
Methods, raw part and device for forging crank crankcoses have the following features: a rod portion (27) is compressed and the flowing material is directed so that a raw part is created, which on both sides of the dipped section two eccentrically counteracted the stabbing arranged points ( 27a) has. In order to make the finished forged pieces (27, 33), the central part of the forged material arranged between the eccentric dampings (27a) is bent by crawling to the compression direction and opposite the vertices of the eccentric dip (27a). During forging, the rod (27) is clamped between divided matrices (20, 21) which are fastened in upper and lower matrices holes (7, 18). The lower matrix holder (7) are hinged at joint levers (5, 11), which in turn are articulated on the base (1, 2, 3). In this base (2, 22) a bending tool (23) is attached. The upper matrix holder (8) are movably mounted in a header (16) mounted on the pressing ram. In this head piece (16, 24) an amboss (25) is attached, which has two mutually interchangeable working surfaces.
