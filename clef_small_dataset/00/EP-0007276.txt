<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to demo delational demo devices by frequency displacement.a demodulation device comprises a surface wave filter having two input transducers powered in parallel by the modulated and separated signals by a given distance, and an output transducer composed of electrodes E₁ to E'n + 1 and E '₁ to E'n + 1.The signals delivered by the electrodes E₁ to E₁N + 1 are applied to the inputs of an algebra that 7, through the switches I₁ to in + 1 controlled by logic signals t₁ to tn + 1.The output of the summrator is connected to the output of the demodulation device through a threshold device 8;The T₁ TN + 1 signal programming makes it possible to make a filter adapted to the signals to demodulate.application to digital information transmission systems.
