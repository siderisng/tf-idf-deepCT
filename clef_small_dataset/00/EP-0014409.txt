<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of α-hydroxycarboxamides of the formula in which R¹ is hydrogen or alkyl, R² and R³ are the same or different, and individually for hydrogen, optionally substituted, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or a nitrogen-containing Heterocyclic residue or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, optionally substituted, optionally partially unsaturated and optionally benzaneled mono- or bicycles, which may optionally contain further heteroatoms, by reacting α-halocarboxamides with acetates to α-acetoxycarboxamides and Entacylism of these intermediates characterized in that in the first stage of α-halocarboxamides of the formula (wherein Hal is chlorine or bromine), with an alkaline or alkaline earthlycetate in the presence of a quaternary ammonium salt and optionally under use a Verdun substantifier at temperatures between 20 and 200 ° C and second stage the α-acetoxycarboxylic acid amides prepared in this way by reaction with an alcohol of the formula R⁴ - OH (IV) (where R⁴ is alkyl) in the presence of catalytic amounts An alkaline or alkaline arc lihydroxide or an alkaline or alkaline earthicarbonate at temperatures between 20 and 150 ° C. The α-hydroxycarboxylic acid amides (I) can be used as ZWi
