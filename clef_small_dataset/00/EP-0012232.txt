<ABSTRACT>
in a control system having an electric power source, a  controlled load kept operative when the electric power is  supplied from the power source and a digital computer pro­ grammed to control the operation of the controlled load by  executing stored instructions in timed relation with periodic  clock pulses, the digital computer is constructed as a c-mos  type and a switch-over circuit is provided to keep the fre­ quency of the periodic clock pulses at a high and low values  when the electric power supplied to keep the controlled load  operative is sufficient and insufficient, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for switching over the operating frequency of a digital computer background of the invention the present invention relates to an apparatus for switching over, when the supply of electric power to a controlled load controlled by a c-mos digital computer is switched off, the operating frequency of the digital computer from a high value to a low value to reduce the electric power consumed by the digital computer. in a control system in which the operation of a controlled load kept operative with the supply of electric power is controlled by a digital computer programmed to perform predetermined calculations by executing stored instructions in timed relation with periodic clock pulses, it is often necessitated that the digital computer keeps storing the calculation result even after the supply of electric power to the controlled load is switched off. for this reason, the digital computer must be kept supplied with the electric power irrespective of the switched-on and switched-off conditions of the supply of electric power to the controlled load. the digital computer thus consumes the electric power. it is therefore desirable, particularly in the case where the power supply capacity of the electric power source is limited, to reduce the electric power consumed by the digital computer. summary of the invention it is an object of the invention to utilize a c-mos type digital computer for controlling the operation of a controlled load and to switch over the operating frequency of the digital computer from a high value to a low value when the supply of electric power to the controlled load is switched off. brief description of the drawings fig.1 is a block diagram illustrating a first embodiment according to the invention, figs.2, 3, 4, and 5 are electric wiring diagrams illustrating different examples of the switch-over circuit 3 of fig.1, fig.6 is a block diagram illustrating a second embodiment according to the invention, fig.7 is an electric wiring diagram illustrating the example of the switch-over circuit 6 of fig.6, fig.8 is a block diagram illustrating a third embodiment of the invention, fig.9 is a block diagram illustrating a fourth embodiment of the invention, fig.10 is an electric wiring diagram illustrating the details of fig.9, and fig. 11 is an electric wirwny diagram illustrating partly in schematic a fifth embodiment of the invention. detailed description of the preferred embodiment the present invention is described hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings through which the same reference numerals are used to designate the same circuits or components. in fig.1 illustrating a first embodiment, numeral 1 designates a source of electric power such as a storage battery across which an electric controlled load 5 is connected through a normally-open switch 4. numeral 2 designates a digital computer connected across the electric power source 1 to be kept operative with the supply of electric power. the digital computer 2 is a c-mos(complementary metaloxide semiconductor) type microcomputer which comprises a cpu(central processing unit), rom(read only memory), ram(random access memory) and associated circuits. it
