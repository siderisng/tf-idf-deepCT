<ABSTRACT>
1.  transmitter-receiver-system for the transmission and reception of a digital control signal, in which the transmitter is located outside the body of a patient and the receiver is located in a heart pacemaker implanted in the patient, for the purpose of switchin-in a selected operating condition by means of the digital control signal, and in which the digital control signal and an additional check signal are serially transferred from the transmitter to the receiver and the change-over of the operating condition is only permitted if the additional check signal is transmitted correctly, characterized in that means are provided in the transmitter for the conversion of the digital control signal into a signal to be transmitted in such a way that in a sequence of reference signals (leading flanks 1, 2) a further signal (trailing flanks 3, 4, 4') follows as a result of each such reference signal, the position in time of the further signal being variable with reference to the reference signal and being determined by a part of the information included in the digital control signal, that, to reproduce the control signal, the receiver includes means for evaluating the received signals in such a way that there is transmitted in each case the position in time of the further signal (3, 4, 4') with reference to a signal forming a time barrier (5, 6) and following the received reference signal (1, 2) by a separation in time which is defined by timing means of the receiver, and that the check signal forms a redundant signal component of the control signal to be transferred and is evaluated jointly with the latter.
