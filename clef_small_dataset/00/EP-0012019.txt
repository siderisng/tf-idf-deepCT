<ABSTRACT>
a supporting electrode (16,18) is mounted on at least one  surface of a semiconductor substrate (11).  the sides of the  substrate (11) and the electrode are covered by epoxy resin  (43).  in order to avoid problems arising from the different  thermal expansion coefficients of the various materials, the  electrode is formed of a copper-carbon fiber composition  metal in which carbon fibers are embedded in a spiral and lie  parallel to the major surface of the substrate, so that the  electrode exhibits anisotropic thermal expansion properties.   its coefficient of expansion parallel to the major surface of the  substrate is lower than its coefficient in the direction perpen­ dicular to this surface, since the expansion coefficient of the  substrate (e. g.  silicon) is lower than that of the resin (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
"semiconductor device" this invention relates til a semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor substrate at least one electrode bonded to a major surface of said substrate end a body of synthetic resin material covering at least one side surface of said substrate and at least one side surface of said electrode the invention also relates to a method of making such a device and to a method of making an electrode for such a device in semiconductor devices, a semiconductor element is placed in a metal-ceramic composite casing or is covered by an insulating material such as synthetic resin or glass for protection from the adverse effects of the external atmosphere and external forces and for keeping a long distance aqoa1g the surface and hence a high dielectric strength. unvering with synthetic resin is relatively @@ple and thus suitable for inexpensive semiconductor devices. a typical example of an inexpensive semiconductor device is one an induced by soldering @@ semiconductor e-%--- & @@@@@ and covering the semi conductor ment the lead wires with .t*..¯ synticale @@@@ (for instance, the the mr #ir 2500 dies medium current silicon rectifiers (50 to 1000 volts, 25 @@@@@, diffused junction) available from motorola inc.). however, rosin-mold packaged semiconductor devices of large current capacity, for example, about 400a at 1000v have not yet been produced. one reason for this is that the semiconductor substrate, electrode materials and synthetic resin used in such a device have different thermal expansion characteristics. an object of this invention is to provide a semiconductor device, particularly one of large current capacity, in which the semiconductor element is protected at its sides by res±#olding, and in which problems caused by differences of thermal expansion are avoided. the invention as claimed seeks to provide a remedy. the aim is that the thermal expansion coefficient of the electrode body or electrode member in the direction parallel to the surface to which the semiconductor element is attached is equal to that of the semiconductor element, and that the thermal expansion coefficient of the electrode in the direction perpendicular to this surface is approximately the same as that of the synthetic resin. perfect matching of the coefficients of thermal expansion in this manner is generally not practicable, but the invention proposes that the matchizyy of the coefficients is better than if the electrode does not have anisotropic expansion characteristics to produce a semiconductor device of the invention with such the desired thermal expansion characteristics, there is preferably employed a copper-carbon composite metal (or a composite body having carbon fibers embedded in substantially uniform distribution in a matrix of copper) having different thermal expansion coefficients in directions perpendicular to each other. in this way, good matching of the thermal expansion coefficients of the semiconductor substrate, the electrode materials and the synthetic resin may be achieved. embodiments of this invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: fig. 1 is an explanatory exploded cross-sectional view of a semiconductor device embodying
