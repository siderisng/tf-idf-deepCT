this invention relates to a weather strip and balance  assembly for a window of a tilt sash type.  the assembly  includes a mounting plate (70) for mounting the balance  assembly thereon with a weather strip (50) being clipped  thereto and supporting the sash in a sliding and sealing  manner.  the weather strip (50) has a pair of curved supporting  ridges (52, 53) which mount the sash at conventional  grooved surfaces along the stiles of the same and a  recessed divider portion (54) between the curved ridges  in the weather strip provides for mounting and movement  of the coupling pins (95 to 97) which connect the balance  assembles to the sash and permit tilt of the sash on the  weather strip (50).  the mounting members on the sash for  coupling the pins thereto provide mating keyed surfaces  (101) such that the pins rotate with the sash.  these mounting  members also include guide surfaces which couple  the sash in a closed position.
