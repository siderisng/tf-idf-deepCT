<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic bipolar memory cell is specified, which consists of two complementary, respectively connected between base and collector transistors, and the PNP transistor serves as a read transistor and the NPN transistor as a write transistor and wherein the storage between the base of the reading transistor and the collectorThe writing transistors is located.The memory point is connected to a first capacitance which is above the emitter base section of the reading transistor, having a second capacitor which is located above the base collector path of the NPN transistor and with a third capacitor, between a fixed potential and a common point betweenCollector of the reading transistor and the base of the write transistor.
