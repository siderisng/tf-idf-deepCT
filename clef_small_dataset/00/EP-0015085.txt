<ABSTRACT>
a process is disclosed for producing self-fluxing, sintered  ores using a raw materials mix comprising at least 25 wt% of  fine grains below 1 mm in size and not more than 5. 4 wt% of  sio₂ in terms of sintered ore product.  the process is characterized  by control of the sio₂ content of said fine grains to be  at least 50 wt% of the total sio₂ content of the mix, and  sintering of the thus controlled mix.

<DESCRIPTION>
title an improved raw materials mix and placess for producing self-fluxing, sintered ores, and improved self-fluxing, sintered ores this inveiltion relates to an improvecl raw materials mix for producing self-fluxing, sintered ores, and moic particluarly, to an improved process for producing lowslag, silltered ores which are resistant to disintegration, and the improved self-fluxing sintered ores resultinng from the process. the process is based on the finding that the sio2 content of the fine grains of the new materials mix is important to the production of improved self-fluxing, sintered ores. sintereing bv a common dwight-lloyd sinter machille generally comprises preparing a raw materilas mix of iran ore, limestone, silica, miscellaneous other materials and coke, agglomerating the mix in the presence of and charging the resulting agglomerate into the sinter machine. in that machine, the surface layer of tic sinter bed is ignited in an ignition furnace, and suction is applied downwardly of the sinter bed for a period of about 20 minutes during which the whole thickness of the sinter bed is sintered, starting from tic surface layer and ending with the bottom layer. in the production of sintered ores which flux themselves and have a cao/sio2 level in the range of from 1.0:1 to 2.0:1 generally from 1.3:1 to 1.8:1, a high productivity, a low fuel consumption and an improved quality in terms of shatter index and degradation index after reduction at 550 c (rdi) are factors always to be kept in mind. in order to improve the rdi value which expresses, as a weight percentage of graiiis below 5 mm in side, the ease with which the sintered ore disintegrates when subjected to a reducing atmosphere in a blast furnace at a temperature in the range of from 400 to 600 c according to the conventional technique, either tbe coke content of the mix or its slag content (expressed as the sum of cao andsio2) is increased. the first method, i.e. increasing the coke content, is effective in improving the rdi value, but lowers the gas permeability of the sinter bed, thus decreasing tiie productivity and reducibility while increasing coke consumption. the second method, i.e. increasing the slag content (expressed as the sum of cao and sio2), achieves the intended purpose, but calls for mote slag to be charged into the blast furnace, thus inecreasing the blast furnace fuel consumption. usually, blast furnaces are charged with about 300 kg of slag per ton of pig, and this amount is far greater than the amount necessary for furnace operations. as mentioned aboe, such excess slag is primarily due to the high content of sio2 carried with the furnace charge, especially itsmajor ingredient, i.e., the sintered ore. a small sio2 content of sintered ore denotes a low strength and a low yield of sintered ore. to avoid this problem, it has been necessary to keep the s102 content of the sintered ore in the range of from about 5.6 to about 6.o wt%, inclusive. certain proposals have been made for decreasing
