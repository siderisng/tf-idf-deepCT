<ABSTRACT>
the object of this invention is to provide a system which uses sea currents and river currents as energy source in order to produce electricity by means of a turbine or a plurality of turbines of the "bulb" type.  the system consists essentially of the following: a frame (1) comprising water ballast tanks (2) enabling it to be floated, sunk or re-floated.  a circular or partially circular hydraulic collector (5) converging towards a venturi (8).  a turbine (9) of the "bulb" type, the blades of which rotate inside the venturi (8).   a diffuser (10) disposed at the outlet of the collector (5).  depending upon the type of system required, this unit is intended for deep sinking on a sea bed to collect currents in all directions, gyratory currents, ebbing and flowing currents and irregular currents, or alternatively on the bed of a water- house (running water) in order to collect the currents thereof.
