<ABSTRACT>
the tags (1) are each comprising an approximately  rectangular text carrier (5), a fastening portion (6) having at  least one perforation (7) therein, and at least one coilable  prong (8) are supplied in the form of a strip stepwise to an  application station (4), where two jaws (23, 24) engage a tag  and attach it to the poultry by coiling the prong.  each tag is  engaged by the jaws at a prong and at the opposite edge of  the text carrier, the prong is coiled into an associated  perforation, and for the supply of the strip of tags, the strip is  engaged by the same perforations.

<DESCRIPTION>
method, apparatus and tag for tagging poultry and the like. this invention relates to a method of tagging successively supplied poultry and the like with tags each comprising an approximately rectangular text carrier, a fastening portion comprising at least one perforation and at least one coilable prong, in which the tags are supplied in the form of a strip in which the tags are laterally interconnected at the text carriers in a rupturable manner, said strip being supplied stepwise, in synchronism with the supply of the pieces of poultry, to an application station, where two jaws are disposed which engage a tag and, while this is pressed against a piece of poultry and separated from the strip, attach it to the poultry by coiling the prong or prongs. in this prior technique, each tag is engaged by the two jaws at the prong or prongs adjacent to the perforation in the fastening portion of the tag, so that an edge of the perforation functions as an abutment. as a consequence, the longitudinal dimension or prior tags is not, at least not exclusively, determined by the size of the mark to be put on the text carrier, but also by the minimum distance between the perforations and the prongs of the tag. this dimension must not be too small, because otherwise the approaching stroke of the jaws becomes too small and hence proper coiling of the prong or prongs, and reliable fastening of a tag to a head of poultry cannot be quaranteed. as a consequence, prior tags are relatively large, and in view of the fact that they are used by the millions, the loss of material resulting from this is an important and disadvantageous cost item. it is an object of the invention to provide a method which enables the use of tags which do not have this disadvantage. for this purpose, in the method according to the invention, each tag is engaged by the jaws at the prong or prongs and at the opposite edge of the text carrier, during the coiling of the prong the tip thereof is guided into an associated perforation in the fastening portion, and for the supply of the strip of tags to the jaws, the strip is engaged by the same perforations. ty using not the perforations but a terminal edge of the text carrier as the abutment, the perforations in the fastening portion of each tag may be provided relatively closely to the prongs, and this so closely that the prongs can coil through associated perforations and hence ensure a reliable fastening to the poultry meat. the size of the text carrier is exclusively ivenined by the size of the text to be put on it, and consequently the consumption of material is limited to the absolute minimum. moreover, the presence of perforations is put to good use for a reliable supply of the tags. this will be entered into in more detail hereinafter. the present invention also relates to an

 claims   1. a method of tagging successively supplied poultry and the like with tags each comprising an approximately rectangular text carrier, a fastening portion comprising at least one perforation and at least one coilable prong, in which the tags are supplied in the form of a strip in which the tags are laterally interconnected at the text carriers in a rupturable manner, said strip being supplied stepwise, in synchronism with the supply of pieces of poultry, to an application station, where two jaws are disposed which engage a tag and, while this is pressed against a piece of poultry and separated from the strip, attach it to the poultry by coiling the prong or prongs, characterized in that each tag is engaged by the jaws at the prong or prongs and at the opposite edge of the text carrier,  during the coiling of the prong the tip thereof is guided into an associated perforation in the fastening portion, and for the supply of the strip of tags to the jaws, the strip is engaged by the same   peforations.      2. apparatus for carrying out the method according to claim 1, comprising jaws for engaging successive tags supplied in the form of a strip and having perforations and prongs, means for separating the tags from the strip, and pressing the tags against poultry, one of the jaws, the coiling jaw, being arranged for engaging and coiling the prong or prongs of a tag, and the other, the   counter-jaw,    being arranged for engaging an edge of the tag located at a distance from the prong, there being further provided a supply means for engaging the strip of tags and advancing the same stepwise to the jaws, characterized in that the counter-jaw is arranged to engage the terminal edge of the tag that is remote from the prong or prongs, and the supply means is formed as a cam wheel which can engage with the perforations in the strip of tags and can be driven stepwise,  attuned to the jaw movements.   3. a tag for carrying out the method according to claim 1 and/or for use in the apparatus according to claim 2,   comprising    a   substanb#y     rectangular text carrier merging on one end into a fastening portion which at the end rencte   trom    the text carrier is   provided    with at least one coilable prong, and at least one perforation being   foamed    in said fastening portion, characterized in that the distance of the perforation or perforations to the prong or prongs has been so selected relative to the prong length that when a prong is coiled its tip can penetrate into an associated perforation.    4. a tag according to claim 3, characterized in that, in a tag, at least in a strip of such tags interconnected in a rupturable   manner    by the adjacent edges of the text carriers, the distance between successive perforations corresponds to the pitch of the teeth of the transporting wheel of the tag applicator as claimed in claim 2.
