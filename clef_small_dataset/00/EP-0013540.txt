<ABSTRACT>
Method for coloring or printing organic fiber material from z. b. Polyamide, polyester or polyacrylni tril, furthermore also made of cellulose, using a dyeing or printing aid containing a quaternary ammonium salt. A salt is a reaction process of a copolymer of maleic anhydride and ethylene, propyia or styrene with a n, n-disubstituted N-alkylenediamine, a homopolymer of a vinyl pyridine or a quaternized copolymer of a vinyl piperidine and styrene, wherein the reaction product is the homo and copolymer with z. b. Benzyl chloride are quaternized. A treated with a tertiary monoamine quaternized homopolymer of a vinyl benzene ylchloride can also be used as a ammonium salt. The with z. b. Direct or dispersion dyes or cationi dyes colored or printed fiber materials are an excellent egalality, a good through-staining and good wet fastness. Multi-tone effects can also be achieved during imaging printing with a reserve pressure paste and subsequent dyeing.
