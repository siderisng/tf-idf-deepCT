<ABSTRACT>
a nuclear steam generator modularized wrapper as足 sembly comprising at least two separate generally cylin足 drical wrapper modules (24, 42) with tube support plates  (28) therewithin are assembled in stacked relation and  joined within a nuclear containment building (34).  the  assembled modules are then placed in the steam generator  shell (38) with the apertures in the tube support plates (24)  being aligned with the apertures in the tube sheet (56).   a plurality of adjustable spacers (74) fixed to the outer  circumference of the wrapper assembly (24, 42) are pro足 vided and are adjusted to vary the width of the space in  the annulus between the wrapper and shell at various loca足 tions to lock the assembly in place with axial alignment  of all of the apertures in the tube support plates (24, 42)  and tube sheet (56).  the invention facilitates replacement  of the wrapper and tube support plates so as to permit  exchange of the heat transfer tubes of a nuclear steam  generator within the reactor containment.
