<ABSTRACT>
the kiln furniture trim for receiving a single horizontal layer of green ceramic products, e. g.  slabs, consists of a large number of beams (4) lying parallel next to one another on the platform (6) of the firing carriage transversely to its direction of travel, which beams have upwardly open slots which are inclined to the vertical.  support strips (1), the upper edges of which have serrated incisions, are inserted into the slots.  the points of these incisions form the support bosh for the green ceramic products.  <image>
