<ABSTRACT>
This installation comprises to detect in a cocoe, an abnormal elevation of the temperature in a speaker to protect a large number of micro-capsules (m) which are distributed therein, for example by being incorporated in the paint by coating the walls.The micro-capsules are remnant of a fire extinguisher and produce during their bursting a characteristic noise which is detected by microphones 1a, 1b...1N.The installation also comprises, in order to avoid false alarms and to obtain adequate descrimination of the useful signal relative to that generated by normal noise ambient a filtering and processing circuit that operates essentially in a digital way.
