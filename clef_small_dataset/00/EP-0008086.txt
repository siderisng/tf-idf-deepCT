<ABSTRACT>
an arrangement for the encrypted transmission of information items, particularly speech, by means of a controllable memory device (s), into which the incoming information items are successively stored, subdivided into time elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 1', 2', 3', 4', 5') at the transmitting end are read out again exchanged in time with respect to one another for their transmission and in which this exchanging of the time elements is cancelled at the receiving end, and in which the control clock pulses for the memory device at the transmitting and the receiving end are in each case extracted from the clock of the clock generator (tg).  in this arrangement, the clock generator is constructed to be controllable in its frequency for blurring the time boundaries of the time elements with the aim of an increased degree of security of the encryption, and its frequency is controlled in a pseudo-random manner by means of a random noise generator (qzg).  <image>
