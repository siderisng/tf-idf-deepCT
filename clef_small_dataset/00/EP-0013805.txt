<ABSTRACT>
a domestic food process of the kind having an electric  motor drive unit 1 with a directly or indirectly driven drive  shaft 2 to which mixing and/or cutting blades are attachable,  has the drawback that the blades continue to rotate for a  short time after the motor drive has been switched off, with  consequent risk of damage to a users fingers if contacting the  blades.  the specification discloses a safety means for brak足 ing rotation of the drive shaft 2 and thus reducing the fore足 going risk, in which a brake pad rod 6 of friction material is re足 siliently maintained in contact with the shaft 2 by a compres足 sion coil spring 8 via a shoe 9 slidably housed in a housing 13  removably attached to the unit 1.
