<ABSTRACT>
essential for this are at least two guide funnels (19) rotating out of phase with respect to one another, for in each case one dough strand produced beforehand, the funnel outlets (21) extending eccentrically to the axes of rotation.  the dough strands are guided between an extruder and the guide funnel by means of conveyor belts designed to execute a conveying motion in the longitudinal direction and to execute a continuous reciprocating transverse motion.  the dough strands emerging from the funnel outlets are deposited on a conveyor belt (22) and already have the desired interwoven structure.  by altering the speeds of rotation of the funnels, their spacing, the rate of advance of the conveyor belt receiving the interwoven structure and the like, it is possible to vary the parameters of the interwoven structure as desired within wide limits.  <image>
