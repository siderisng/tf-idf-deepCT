<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rapid flow blower burner of gas flow.The burner, object of the invention, has two symmetrical half-shells (2 and 3) within which a diffusion grid (6) constituting the nozzle means which delimits a relaxing chamber (7) and a chamber.Combustion (8), said gate (6) has an omega-shaped section whose front portion (11) is provided with recesses as well as the side walls (12) extending said front wall (11).The grid (6) is maintained so that the side walls (12) and the inner walls of the burner constitute corridors (15) for the flow of the gas flow passing through said walls (12) and whose combustion hasLocation outside the burner thanks to the extension (16) of the conical chamber (8) causing an increase in flow velocity of the lateral stream and the attachment of the flame.
