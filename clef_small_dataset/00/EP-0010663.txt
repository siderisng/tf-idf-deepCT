<ABSTRACT>
For the heating of rubber products, in particular for the purpose of vulcanization, a possibility of good energy use at a similar field distribution is created by the fact that the waveguide has a branch (5) that each branch of the waveguide is coupled to the resonator chamber and that at least at least A branch immediately next to the coupling point to the resonator chamber has a tuning device (10, 12) and it is arranged so that the field geometry in the treatment room variable and the shaft resistance of the waves is adaptable to the microwave generator. This tuning device does not only affect the one branch, but also acts on the other branch at the same time and not only acts on the shaft distribution in both branches of the waveguide, but it also acts uniterably on the radiation characteristics of the coupling sites (9, 15) . Thus, a moderate vulcanization of a profile strand is achieved in favorably energy utilization.
