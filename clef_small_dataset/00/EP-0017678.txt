<ABSTRACT>
a method of forming a heat-sealable carton (5) having  a pair of mating surfaces (15, 19) to be sealed includes  the steps of coating at least one of the carton surfaces  with a heat-activated thermosetting adhesive (37), spray­ ing a fine mist of a water-based adhesive (39) which exhi­ bits high contact tackiness when dry, to form a discontinu­ ous film on the coated surface, heating the water-based  adhesive coated surface to a temperature sufficient to dry  the water based adhesive and activate the thermosetting  adhesive, placing the mating carton surfaces (15, 19) in  contact with each other and applying pressure for a time  sufficient to seal the contacting surfaces together.  a car­ ton (5) is provided with flaps (15, 19) sealed by the com­ bination of thermosetting heat-activated adhesive (37) and  high tack water-based adhesive (39).  this allows the mat­ ing surfaces (15, 19) to be rapidly sealed by automatic  carton closing apparatus (1) and results in a sealed carton  (5) which exhibits good seal integrity at high temperatures.
