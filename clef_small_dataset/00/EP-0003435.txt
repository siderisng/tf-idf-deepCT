<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector comprises a body of electrically  insulating material carrying a plurality of electrical contacts  all lying in a common plane, each contact (5) having a first  contact portion (12) accessible through a window (13) in the  body (4) and adapted for reception in the slot of a slotted  plate terminal (15) of a further electrical connector (3), and  each contact (5) having a second contact portion (14)  projecting from the body (4) and in the form of a slotted plate  for receiving and establishing electrical connection to a  conductor of a flat flexible multi-conductor electrical cable  (2), all the second contact portions (14) of the contacts (5)  extending in the same direction and lying in a common  plane, the pitch distance between the first contact portions  (12) of the contacts (5) being different from that of the second  contact portions (14) of the contacts (5).
