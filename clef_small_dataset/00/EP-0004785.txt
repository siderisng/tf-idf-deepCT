<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a fetal monitoring apparatus  comprising a tubular member having a forward end adapted  to be inserted through the vagina and cervix of a woman in  labour, a coil movably mounted in the tubular member, the  coil being adapted to be attached to the skin of a fetus,  characterised in that the apparatus includes converter means  whereby an applied linear force can be converted to rotary  force to turn said coil.  in the preferred embodiment (figure  12a), used for attaching a coil electrode to the skin of a fetus  e. g.  to measure heart rate during labour, helical grooves  (158) are formed on a motion converter (150) having  electrode carrier (109); pins (118) on a plunger (116) engage  grooves (158).  depression of plunger (116) causes converter  (150) to move forward and rotate.  carrier (109) is adapted to  turn when converter (150) turns.  the coil electrode (106)  moves forward with carrier (109) and engages the skin of the  fetus.  flange (117) limits forward movement of converter  (150).
