<ABSTRACT>
the high speed running bearing assembly (1) comprises  at least on one side of the stationary race ring (2) a ring like  means (7) made of porous material, adjoined by a source (9)  of lubricant an end part (10) thereof extending into the vicin­ ity of the running surface (11) of the rotating race ring (4),  such that the lubricant, under influence of the negative pres­ sure generated by high rotation (more than 15. 000 r/m)  being drawn out from said end part (10) and moved from the  said part, mainly in radial direction to the said stationary race  ring (2) and returned to the porous ring (7) along the running  surface (13) of the said stationary race ring (2).
