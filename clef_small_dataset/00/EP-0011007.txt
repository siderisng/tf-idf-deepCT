<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention relates to a multi-lobe sleeve and its method of embodiment, the inner wall of said sheath being made of n cylindrical sectors adjacent angle at the center (A) and radius (R) an armor each a screw on the part of the periphery of it external to the penetration zone. According to the invention, the shells (1) each pre-sensing an inner face (10) in the shape of a cylindrical sector born in radius (R) and angle in center (b) less than (a) and n rules (2) each having two concave faces in the form of cylindrical sectors borne in the radius (R), an angle to the center and whose axes are parallel and apart from a distance equal to the Spacer of the screws and each shell (1) is fixed on two rules (2) so that its axis coincides with the corresponding concave face axes (20) said rules (2). The invention applies to machines with several nested screws of the extruding genus.
