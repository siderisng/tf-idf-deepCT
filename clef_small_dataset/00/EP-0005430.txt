<ABSTRACT>
A flow machine is provided which comprises at least one disc-shaped, flow channels for fluid comprising impeller. The inlet openings of the flow channels are located on the one side of the impeller, while the respective outlet openings are arranged on the other end face and all inlet openings have a different distance to the axis of rotation than the outlet openings. Each flow channel has a radially further and a radially closer knee with two thighs each forming approximately a 90 degree angle. A leg of one knee leads to the inlet opening and is directed toward the relative speed of the occurring flow flow, while a leg of the other knee leads to the outlet opening and extends in the direction of the relative speed of the outlet flow there. The other thighs of the two deflection knees are executed to a approximately radial connecting portion, which connects the two deflection knees together. In the flow machine, a reduction of the stepper is achieved without reducing circumferential and absolute speeds. Furthermore, a small volume throughput should also be assigned a relatively small step graduation and the speed of the machine is increased. For this purpose, in the flow machine, the leg of the one deflection knee leads to the inlet opening are directed so that the thigh of the other deflection knee is directed so that the tangential components of the relative speeds are directed equal to the inlet and outlet openings or these tangential components on the inlet openings or at the exit openings completely eliminated.
