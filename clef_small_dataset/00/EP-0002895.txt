<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to enzyme inhibitory, novel  phthalazin-4-ylacetic acid derivatives of the general formula  i:    wherein r¹ is a hydroxy or benzyloxy radical, or a c₁₋₄-alkoxy  radical optionally bearing an n-morpholino or a  c₁₋₄-alkylamino radical, x is oxygen or sulfur, the rings a  and b may be substituted, pharmaceutically acceptable  salts as appropriate, to pharmaceutical compositions thereof,  and to analogy processes for their manufacture.  the  compounds of formula i are inhibitors of the enzyme aldose  reductase in vivo and as such may be useful in the reduction  or prevention of the development of the peripheral  effects such as macular oedema, cataract, retinopathy or  impaired neural conduction.  a preferred compound is  2-(2-fluoro-4-bromobenzyl)-1,2-dihydro-1-oxophthalazin-4-ylacetic  acid.
