<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula (i):    wherein the pyrrolidino and or moieties are trans and  wherein r is a hydrogen atom an alkyl group of 1 to 3 car­ bon atoms or an acyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms; or a  pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof; are  anti-hypertensive agents.  their preparation and formula­ tion is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
chromanol derivatives a process for their preparation and their use in pharmaceutical compositions british patent specification no. 1495526 discloses a large group of derivatives of trans- 3 -bydroxy-4- aminochroman which have blood pressure lowering activity. british patent specification no. 1511187 discloses a further group of derivatives of trans-3-hydroxy-4-aminochroman which also have blood pressure lowering activity. british patent specification no. 1511187 also disclosed that 6-cyano-3, 4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-trans-4-piperidino-2h-benzo[b] pyran-3-ol was a useful chemical intermediate although it was not suggested to be of particular use as an anti hypertensive agent in its own right. it has been found that trans-3-hydroxy-4-aminochromans such as the favoured 6-nitro compounds previously described as having vasodilatory activity also have unwanted cardiac effects. clearly it is desirable to have compounds that has a better therapeutic ratio as judged by the separation of desired vasodilatory effects from undesired cardiac effects. it has now been found that 6-cyano-3,4-dihydro-2, 2-dimethyl-trans-4-pyrrolidino-2r-ben2o [b jpyran-3-ol (and especially the (+)-isomer thereof) and certain derivatives have such desirable properties. accordingly the present invention provides the - compounds of the formula (i): emi2.1 wherein the pyrrolidino and or moieties are trans and wherein r is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms or an acyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. suitable alkyl groups r in relation to formula (i) are the methyl, ethyl and n-propyl groups of which the methyl group is most suitable. suitable acyl 'groups r in relation to formula (i) are unsubstituted carboxylic acyl groups much as unsubstituted aliphatic acyl or benzoyl. preferably r in relation to formula (i) is a hydrogen atom. the compounds of the formula (i) may be provided in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers or as a single stereoisomer.it is particularly convenient to prepare and use the compounds of the formula (i) as racemic mixtures. most of the desirable biological activity of the compounds of the formula (i) is found in the (+)-isomer of the compound wherein r is hydrogen and in the derivatives thereof wherein r is alkyl or acyl. thus in a preferred aspect this invention provides such (+)-isomers (that is when effectively free of the (-)isomer). suitable acid addition salts of the compounds o the formula (i) are those with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, methanesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, acetic, propionic, succinic, citric, tartaric, mandelic, lactic, gluconic or the like acid. the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula (i) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which process comprises the reaction of the compound of the formula (it1: emi3.1 with pyrrolidine and thereafter optionally reacting the thus produced compound of the formula (i) wherein r is a hydrogen atom and thereafter optionally alkylating or acylating said compound, resolving any of said compounds and/or salifying any of the resulting compounds of formula (i). the trans- isomer is specifically formed. the reaction of the epoxide may be carried out at any
