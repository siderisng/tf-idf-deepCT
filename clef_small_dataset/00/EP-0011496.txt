<ABSTRACT>
a child-resistant threaded closure (10) for containers  includes a lower ring-like portion (12) which is attached to  the closure sidewall by two diametrically opposite retract­ able and extendible links (13) and has a matching thread  segment.  with the closure screwed in place on a container,  the ring (12) is pushed downwardly by means of diametri­ cally opposite tabs (17) to a position below the last thread on  the container with the links extended.  in this position, when  an attempt is made to unscrew the closure, the thread seg­ ment of the ring (12) interfers with the last thread of the  container and prevents its removal.  for the closure to be  removed, the ring (12) must be lifted up by the tabs (17) until  the links are fully retracted and the thread segment matches  up with the thread in the closure sidewall, whereupon the  closure can be unscrewed.
