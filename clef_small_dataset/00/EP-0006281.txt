<ABSTRACT>
a body implantable stimulator, e. g.  a heart pacemaker  comprises a signal generator (10), a preformed electrical  connector (12) and at least one electrical lead (11) electri­ cally and mechanically connected to the signal generator  by preformed electrical connector (12).  the connector car­ ries at least one terminal (40) to establish electrical contact  between the signal generator (10) and electric lead (11),  passageways (41, 43) being provided in the connector  body (25) to accept and guide the signal generator feed-­ through pins (18, 19) and electrical lead (11) into contact  a with the terminal (40).  the terminal (40) is provided with  intersecting bores (51, 52) such that the respective feed-­ through pins (18, 19) and electrical lead (11) form electrical  contact within or by means of the terminal.  the pins (18,  19) may be welded or press fit to the terminal (40) and the  lead (11) may be attached to the terminal by means of a  set screw (47).  the preformed connector may be mechani­ cally fastened or fastened with an adhesive to the implant­ able stimulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
body implantable stim##latop# and connector therefor this invention relates to a body implantable stimulator comprising a signal generator and a lead connector secured thereto. such body implantable stimulators are known to the prior art, the most common being the cardiac or heart pacemaker. typically such stimulators are formed of a separable electrical lead and a signal generator with provision being made to electrically and mechanically connect the lead an generator to complete the stimulator unit. many prior art signal generators have been formed following assembly by casting the components, including mechanical and electrical connections for the lead, in a matrix of encapsulating material, typically epoxy resin, which supports the components and shields them from the body environment. in the body environment, it is generally recognized that an enclosed and hermetically sealed signal generator is more reliable as a result of the known and controlled environment provided by the hermetic seal for this reason, many recent signal generator designs include a rigid enclo sure formed of a plurality of preformed members which are typically welded together to complete the enclosure. the connection between the generator and the electrical lead, when it is desired that these members be separable, occurs outside of such an enclosure. it is common to cast a connector from epoxy. however, it would be beneficial to eliminate the epoxy encapsulation process. thus a preformed connector, which may be reliably secured to a preformed signal generator enclosure housing the generator components, would greatly facilitate assembly of the stimulator. the amount of handling would be reduced with the remaining handling being easier to perform than an epoxy casting process. one type of preformed connector assembly is disclosed in united states patent application serial number 793,642. the above referenced application provides a preformed connector assembly thereby eliminating the necessity of forming that assembly in place, as by an epoxy casting process, for example. additionally, in that assembly, the electrical connection between the connector assembly terminal and the signal generator requires manipulation of a wire to position it and a weld, or other similar process, to secure it in position. thus, while the connector assembly of the above referenced application greatly reduces the handling necessary to form and complete a connector assembly on a signal generator unit, considerably handling remains necessary. these shortcomings of the prior art are overcome by the invention as claimed. in one aspect, the connector is pre formed and mechanical fastener means are provided for securing the connector to the generator. thus, it eliminates the use of epoxy or other similar substances to encapsulate the terminal containing connector after attachment of the connector to the generator. this approach allows quality assurance of each preformed connector prior to assembly or attachment to the generator. the amount of handling necessary to assemble the stimulator andestablishthepmper electrical connections is reduced. in a preferred embodiment, the preformed connector is provided with first means, e.g. passageways which accept and guide the signal generator output connections (usually a feedthrough pin or pins) and preferably
