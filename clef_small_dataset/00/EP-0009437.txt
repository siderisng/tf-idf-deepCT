<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for making electrical contacts from a reel of conducting wire (1), comprising means adapted to straighten out the wire, means (3) for guiding the straightened wire, means (4) for cutting the wire into billets (10) on its leaving the guiding means, and means (7, 8) for welding the billets onto a metal plate (9), device characterized in that it comprises a base (6) provided with a surface (6a, 6b, 6c) for supporting the end face (14) or the wire, disposed on that side of the cutting means (4) opposite the guiding means (3), the cutting means are arranged to cut the wire flush with the guiding means and are animated by a reciprocating movement to transfer the billets along the support surface of the base in the direction of the welding means and the metal plate, and the support surface of the base comprises an inclined ramp (6a) for, during the drive of the billets by the cutting means, slightly disengaging from the plane of cut of the cutting means the end face (5) of the billets opposite their face (14) in contact with the surface of the base.
