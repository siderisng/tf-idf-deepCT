<ABSTRACT>
1.  conveyor-elevator comprising a band (1) passing over at least one pair of end pulleys (4, 5) and to which are attached rollers (2, 2') rolling on at least one pair of rails (3) which each comprise an inclined portion (b) between two essentially horizontal portions (a, c), characterised by the fact that each rail is widened between the horizontal lower portion (a) and the inclined portion (b) and is narrowed between the inclined portion (b) and the horizontal upper portion c, that each horizontal portion comprises a tilting switch of essentially triangular shape the point of which determines an end of each horizontal portion and adapted to pivot on a horizontal axis during the passage of the rollers, in order that the rollers in motion pass alternatively above and below the rail (3), and that the band (1) is coupled to at least one pair of chains (10) attached to round bars (11) in even number, carrying the rolls at their end, one bar out of two being enclosed in a tube (12) fixed to the band.
