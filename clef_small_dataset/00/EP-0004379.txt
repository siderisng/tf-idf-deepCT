<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for folding and packing textiles, having at least one folding station (1, 2), which contains two conveyor belts (10, 11; 20, 21) arranged one above the other at a distance and circulating in the same direction and at the same speed, of which the lower belt protrudes laterally beyond the one longitudinal side of the upper conveyor belt, and in the interspace of which a folding knife (13; 23) can be introduced.  the folding material (5) reaching the upper conveyor belt (11; 21) falls with its part protruding beyond the one longitudinal side of this belt onto the lower conveyor belt (10; 20) and is grasped at this part by the folding knife and taken into the belt interspace.  at the end of the folding station, the parts of the folding material coming from the two belts are arranged above one another, with the formation of a double fold.  <image>
