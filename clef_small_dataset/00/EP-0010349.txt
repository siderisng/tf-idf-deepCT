<ABSTRACT>
a fluid pressure responsive governor device (1) for gov­ erning the operation of a compressor or a compressor  unloader has a spring-biassed valve device (13,14) controlling  connection of an output port (3) to an input port (2) or to  atmosphere according to the valve of a controlling reservoir  pressure at the input port, the valve arrangement being posi­ tively held in the former condition by virtue of enhanced area  exposed to the controlling pressure and the valve arrange­ ment being provided by a seal (13) which is sealingly slideable  in a tubular opening (14) so as to be able to execute movement  due to predetermining pressure changes without resulting in  switching over to the other condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to fluid pressure responsive governor devices and relates especially to such governor devices for controlling the unloading of air compressors such as may be employed for maintaining reservoirs of a fluid pressure vehicle braking system in a charged condition. fluid pressure responsive governor devices have already been proposed which include a valve arrangement which up to a predetermined pressure maintain closed a fluid pressure passage between a pressure input port and a pressure output port and at the same time provide a vent path for the output port so that no pressure signal appears thereat under these conditions. on attainment of the predetermined pressure, however, the valve arrangement unseats to present an increased area to the pressure at the input port thereby effecting a snap. action accompanied.by opening of the communication between the input and output port and closure of the vent path. such valves as have hitherto been proposed have suffered certain shortcomings in that in order to provide stability of operation, the governor has had to be designed such that the predetermined pressure is appreciably higher than the pressure at which the governor returns to its starting condition. according to the present invention, a fluid pressure responsive governor device is proposed which includes a body having a fluid pressure input signal port and a fluid pressure output signal port, spring-loaded valve means responsive to attainment of a predetermined pressure at the input port to move to a condition in which it opens a connection between the input port and the output 20 a p closes an output port vent valve, said member thereafter being positively hold in said condition by virtue of an inc-.ate of efiestivee area exposed to said input port pressure characterised in that means are provided whereby the spring-loaded means is able to execute'covement due to a pressure change whilst nevertheless maintaining closure of the vent valve. preferably the said means is provided by said valve having a tubular seat part and a closure part which is such as to effect a plugging action in the aperture of said tubular part. by virtue of the invention it is found that a governor device can be provided which, whilst remaining stable, enables a reduced pressure differential between tee said predetermined pressure and the lower pressure at which the device subsequently resets. in order that the present invention may be more (.:.early understood and readily carried into effect, the :me will be further described by way of example, wit1 reference to the accompanying drawings of which fig. 1, illustrates in sectional wiew one form of governor device employing the invention and fig. 2, illustrates a similar governor device incaded ; in a compressor unloader arrangement. the pressure-responsive governor device of fig, 1 has a main body i, having an input port 2 and an output port 3. the body 1 has a partially screwthreaded bore 4 within which a valve seat part 5 is screwed, the seat part 5 is itself tubular and the
