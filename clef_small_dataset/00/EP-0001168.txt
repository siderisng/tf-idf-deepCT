<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a decoration material for use in  the wet transfer printing process and the method of using the  material.  the decoration material comprises a flexible substrate,  e. g.  paper, on which is provided a coating of a lacquer.  the  pattern of dyes to be transferred from the decoration material  to the material to be dyed is carried on the lacquer coating.   transfer is obtained by impregnating the material to be dyed  with a pad liquor, then pressing the patterned face of the  decoration material against it at a temperature of 80 to 120Â°c.  the invention enables more of the dye to be transferred  from the flexible substrate to the material being dyed and  hence reduces wastage of dye.  the lacquer consists of a polymer not dyed by the dyes  being used, e. g.  a resin such as chlorinated pvc or chlorinated  natural rubber.
