<ABSTRACT>
a lamp capable of underwater use comprises a rectangular  acrylic body (1) with elongate v-shaped recesses (2) in a  major surface each receiving an elongate beta-light (5).  an  acrylic cover plate (4) is sealed to the major surface and the  body (1) is secured to a steel backing plate (12) with a neoprane  layer (10) between to help dissipate shock loadings.  the  sides of the recesses (2) include an angle of 78Â° to enhance  reflection and may be formed by a reflective lining (30).  the  beta-lights (5) can be received in the recesses by shock absorbent  o-rings (96) grouped in pairs with adhesive in between.   in a modification a disc-shaped beta-light (52) is encapsulated  and received in a body (58) formed by pour moulding which is  closed by a cap (56) which is ultrasonically welded into place.
