<ABSTRACT>
mica, for use as a filler, is coated with a chlorinated hy­ drocarbon by enveloping mica flakes in a fluid medium com­ prising the chlorinated hydrocarbon and a liquid dispersant  therefor, and then drying the flakes at load temperatures.  the  chlorinated hydrocarbon is distributed macroscopically uni­ formly throughout the mica, as a coating, but provides a mic­ roscopically higher level of chlorine at the edges of the mica  flakes, assisting in binding the flakes to plastics materials  such as polypropylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
description this invention relates to a method of treating mica. it is known that certain chlorinated hydrocarbons can act as coupling agents for mica on melt forming resins. one prior art method that is especially suitable method of treating mica with chlorinated hydrocarbons that act as a coupling agent therefor involves mixing mica particles with chlorinated paraffins in powder form at elevated temperature to yield a coating on the mica. although this method serves to provide coated mica particles which are useful as reinforcing materials for melt forming resins, it has the disadvantage that relatively high temperatures must be used. according to the present invention, there is provided a method of treating mica which comprises enveloping mica flakes with a solid chlorinated hydrtcsvbon in the presence of a liquid dispersant, and drying the mica flakes. 3y exposing mica particles to a fluid medium that comprises chlorinated hydrocarbon, active sites at the edges of the mica flakes rapidly and preferentially take on a coating that beneficially aids reinforcement by the coated mica in melt forming resins such as polypropylene. when sufficient fluid is employed to surround each of the flakes, a macroscopically uniform distribution of chlorinated hydrocarbon in the mica filler is achieved. although the mica filler coated as above can be made macroscopically uniform with respect to the chlorinated hydrocarbon, microscopic examination of dried flakes using x-ray techniques shows that chlorine concentration is highest at the edges of the flakes under conditions of this invention. apparently, the edges of the flakes, due to many platelike layers provide more surface area for infiltration by the fluid containing the chlorinated hydrocarbon. advantageously, treating mica filler in accordance with this invention to achieve macroscopic uniformity of coating thereon is rapid and does not require highly elevated temperatures. this quick, low temperature manner of coating therefore is not likely to permit excessive evolution of hydrochloric acid from highly chlorinated hydrocarbons thereby reducing risk of excessive wear t6 coating apparatus. moreover, the fluid medium used in the coating operation may be reclaimed and reused in subsequent coating operations. still further, this coating method is compatible with further coating techniques as by tumbling at elevated temperature the peripherially coated flakes of this invention and with additional chlorinated hydrocarbon, if desired. the mica that may be desirably employed in this invention includes commercially available mica filler materials comprising, for example, muscovite, biotite and phlogophite mica mineral. mica that comprises princiapply by weight phlogopite is preferred, e.g. marietta international suzorite mica. the mica filler is available in a variety of particle sizes and such size is not an important criteria for this invention although mica that passes through a 20 mesh screen and is retained on a 325 mesh screen shows particular advantage with respect to compounding with melt forming resins and chlorinated hydrocarbon of this invention. the shape of mica filler particles is platelike or flake form as is well known. one characterization of mica that is sometimes used is flake aspect ratio or average diameter of
