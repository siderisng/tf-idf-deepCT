<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for producing phosphoric acid by burning yellow phosphorus consists of an acid-resistant material, for example of acid-resistant steel, built combustion tower with cone-shaped deficiency and shallow ground. The combustion tower has in its lower area a stump on the jacket attached and obliquely upwardly directed exhaust pipe, while it is penetrated in its average area of ​​multiple downwards directed injection nozzles. Close to its upper end, the combustion tower is reversed by a concentrically arranged acid cup with overflow Weir, wherein the overflow bracket consists of a completely horizontally arranged on the inside of the acid cup. The acid cup wears a conical tower cover and is confronted with it. Furthermore, the tower cover is centrally penetrated by a holder tube with a phosphorus atomization die. The jacket of the combustion tower has a cone ratio of 1:10 to 1:12, while the angle α is at least 19 ° at least 19 ° with respect to the horizontal formed tower cover. In the central opening of the Turmdec Kel, a water-cooled air guide tube is mounted concentric with the holder tube.
