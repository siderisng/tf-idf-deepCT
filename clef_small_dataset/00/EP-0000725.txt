<ABSTRACT>
the electrode for implantation in the heart, in particular for stimulating the cardiac muscle, has an electrode line, a helical, projecting coil at the heart end of the electrode line for screwing the electrode into the cardiac tissue, and an arrangement projecting beyond the front of the coil during the insertion phase in order to protect against undesired catching during insertion of the electrode through a vein, a cylindrical body (protective core 23) being arranged inside the helical coil (22) and movable relative to the latter in the axial direction in such a way that, during the phase of insertion of the electrode, it ends flush with the front of the helical coil (22) or projects beyond this, and, for the purpose of securing the helical coil (22) in the cardiac tissue, it can be withdrawn, from the area of the coil to be screwed into the tissue, by means of an element (28) which can be activated from outside the body of the patient.  <image>
