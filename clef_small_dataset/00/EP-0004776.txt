<ABSTRACT>
thermoplastic compositions comprise blends of 25 to 65  parts by weight of thermoplastic san resin and 75 to 35 parts  by weight of a nitrile rubber per 100 total parts by weight of  resin and rubber, in which the rubber is present as a  dispersion of particles of the rubber in a matrix of the san  resin, the rubber having a toluene-insoluble gel content of at  least 85%.  preferred compositions having both thermoplastic  and elastomeric properties comprise a blend of 25 to 40 parts  by weight of san resin and 75 to 60 parts by weight of nitrile  rubber.  a preferred process for the production of compositions  of the invention comprises continuous mastication of a  blend of san resin and nitrile rubber with curative for the  rubber at curing temperature until the required extent of  cross-linking of the rubber is attained.

<DESCRIPTION>
the moplastic compositions comprising blends of styrene-acrylonitrile resin and nitrile rubber, and a process for their productionthis application relates to thermoplastic compositions comprising blends or styrene-acrylonitrile resin (hereinafter called san resin) and nitrile rubber, and, especially, such blends in which the nitrile rubber has a high gel content. modification of the impact resistance of san resins by the addition of nitrile rubber is common practice. the softening point of the blends can be increased by curing the rubber component to a soft vulcanized state (u.s.-a 2,439,202). if the rubber is vulcanized to a higher state of cure, the composition becomes a thermoset no longer processable as a thermoplastic. it is known that surface roughness of san resin-nitrile rubber blends could be overcome by building up the toluene-insoluble gel conent of the nitrile rubber to at least 30% and less than 50% prior to incorporation in the san resin (u.s.-a 2,550,139). also known are blends exhibiting improved processing characteristics comprising 50% or more san resin and a mixture of rubbers consisting of saturated acrylate rubber and nitrile rubber with a gel content within the range of 50% to 80% (u.s.-a 2,698,313). curing of such three component blends improves the impact strength of the composition but gives thermosets no longer processable as thermoplastics. the prior art compositions containing nitrile rubber of high gel content are relatively inextensible which makes them unsuitable for applications where parts are subject to severe deformation. thermoplastic compositions of this invention comprise a blend of thermoplastic styrene-acrylonitrile (san resin) and nitrile rubber in which the rubber is present as a dispersion of particles in a matrix of san resin, and containing, per 100 total parts by weight of resin and rubber, 25 to 40 parts by weight of san resin and 75 to 60 parts by weight of nitrile rubber, wherein the composition is elastoplastic, said rubber is cured with a rubber curative and at least 85% insoluble in toluene at room temperature and the rubber particles have a number average particle size of 50 µm or less. they are extensible compositions processable as thermoplastics and have improved toughness as compared to blends of similar composition but in which the gel content of the nitrile rubber is lower, such as 80% or less. the compositions of the invention have high extensibility and toughness, exhibiting elongations at break of at least 100% and toughness, as measured by true stress at break, or at least 300 kg/cm². preferred compositions of the invention exhibit elongations at break of 150% or more, and true stress at break of 400 kg/cm² or more. more preferred compositions of the invention are elastoplastic, i.e., they exhibit rubber-like elasticity yet are processable as the thermoplastics. the blends of the invention comprise gelled nitrile rubber particles dispersed throughout a san resin matrix. properties are dependent upon gel content, dispersion and the size of the nitrile rubber particles in the blend. unlike static cured blends in which the cured rubber is present as a continuous network, resulting in
