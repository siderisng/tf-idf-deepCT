<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the general formula:    wherein each hal is a halogen atoms and r is a group selected  from:    wherein r¹ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, or a salt-­ forming cation, especially in the same stereo-isomeric form  as that of the cyclopropane ring in (+)-3-carene, are novel  intermediates useful in the manufacture of pyrethroid insecti­ cides.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
novel intermediates in the preparation of cyclopropane carboxylate esters and process for their manufacture the invention relates to compounds which are useful intermediates in the preparation of cyclopropanecarboxylate esters. the invention also relates to a process for the preparation of these intermediates. the cyclopropanecarboxylatc esters are insccticidally- active compounds known as "pyrethroids" and u they combine exceptionally good insecticidal properties with a very low mammalian toxicity, they are of considerable interest to the agrochemical industry and much effort has been expended in finding economic routes to them and to their principal intermediates. the general formula of one class of these pyrethroid com- pounds may be represented as follows: emi1.1 where each asterisk denotes an asymmetric carbon atom; each x is a halogen atom; and r is a member of a group of radicals known to impart insecticidal activity to the molecule, e.g., 3-phenoxybenzyl or alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl . it is known that the stereo-isomeric form of the acid portion of the ester of formula i should be in the (1r,cis) form for maximum insecticidal activity, i.e., the absolute configuration at carbon atom 1 is r and the two hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms 1 and 3 are in a cis relationship. this nomenclature is known as the elliott nomenclature and is defined in m. elliott, a.w. farnham, n.f. james, p.h. needham and d.a. pullman, mature, 19to:1 2h8, 710. it follows, therefore, that if these stereo-isomeric esters of formula i are to be prepared, either a stereospecific chemical route is required or the desired stereoisomer must be obtained from a racemic form by physical separation techniques. the latter are expensive and laborious and not readily employed on an industrial scale. the applicant has found a stereo-specific route which uses as starting material the naturally-occurling aibtance(+)-3-carene whose formula is as follows: emi2.1 this compound is an inexpensive readily-available natural terpene and the present application relates to intermediates in a route to the (lr,cis)-acid portion of the pyrethroid ester of formula i starting from (+)-3-carene. the present invention provides compounds of the general formula: emi2.2 wherein each hal represents a halogen atom, especially chlorine or bromine, and r a group selected from: emi3.1 wherein r is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, preferably containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g., a methyl group, or a saltforming cation, e.g., alkali metal, ulonium or alkyl-substituted ammonium. preferably, the compounds of formula iii are in the same stereo-isomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of (+)-3-carene. the three groups which r may represent in formula iii may be named as follows: (i) alkoxycarbonylmethyl or carboxymethyl and salts thereof, (ii) 2,2-dimethoxyethyl, and (iii) 2-methylcarbonyloxy-3-oxobutyl. preferred compounds of the general formula iii are: methyl 2-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-3,3-dimethylcyclopropyl acetate; 2-[2-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-3,3-dimethylcyclopropyl] ethanal dimethyl acetal; and 1-e2-t2,2-dichlorovinyl)-3,3-dimethylcyclopropyls -3-oxo-2 butyl acetate. particularly preferred are those having the same stereoisomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of (+)-3-carene, e.g., the compounds prepared in the examples. the'compounds and their preferred stereo-isomeric form, according to the invention may be prepared by processes known per se, for
