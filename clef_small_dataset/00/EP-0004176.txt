<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method for processing flat photopolymer  printing plates economically allows combined  brushing and solvent action whilst overcoming the problems  of loss of expensive and potentially hazardous volatile solvents  and uneven action over the surface area of the treated  plate.  plates to be processed are held vertically on plate holders  (11, 12) in solvent containers (30, 31) adjacent brushes  carried by a pliable sheet with springs (27) providing a substantially  uniform pressure against the sheet and hence  against the surface of the plates.  the plates mounted on  holders (11, 12) are moved vertically up and down by the  action of a piston rod (9) and pneumatic ram (4).  the uniform  pressure against the pliable sheet may alternatively be provided  by a sac of fluid either open to a reservoir or closed and  biassed against the sheet by springs.  the surface area of the  solvent in containers (30, 31) is relatively small and remote  from the brushing agitation so that a sealing fluid can be  floated on the solvent surface preventing evaporation.  in  addition the brushing under substantially uniform pressure  results in efficient washing in the minimum time.
