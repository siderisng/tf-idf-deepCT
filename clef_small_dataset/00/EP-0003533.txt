<ABSTRACT>
A clutch for vibration-resistant transmission of torques concentrically contains a first and a second coupling member (10, 12). Between the coupling members, at least one elastically deformable intermediate member (26) is arranged as a separate component. This intermediate member (26) is formed positively between loops of ropes (28, 30) attached to the coupling members (10, 12). In some embodiments, a loop with both ends is alternately attached to the one hand and the adjacent loop with both ends on the other coupling member. In other embodiments, all loops (26, 28) with one end to the first and with the other end to the second coupling member (10, 12) are attached but alternately on the one hand and on the other side around the intermediate member (26). The intermediate member (26) may be a torical rubber-elastic body. However, a plurality of individual cylindrical intermediate members can be arranged long ago of the circumference. At the intermediate members (26), rigid support members (50, 52) may be provided which can form part of the loops. With a torsional load, the intermediate member is claimed for pressure from all loops.
