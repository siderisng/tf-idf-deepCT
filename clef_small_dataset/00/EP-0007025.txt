<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for zuming solutions of solid samples for wet chemical analysis, consisting of a sole metal (8) with associated solvent supply (17) and a metering device for metering the sample taken from a larger batch and analyzing sample.The release composition (8) is formed as an overflow vessel and is passed through a constant solvent stream.The metering device is formed as a dosing belt level (1) which continuously doses the sample to the release vessel (8).The solving vessel (8) has at least two chambers (10, 11), which are equipped with loose and mixing means (12 13).The sample solution is removed from the overflow vessel close to the overflow (14) via the line (21).
