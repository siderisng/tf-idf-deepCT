<ABSTRACT>
a pump for a multi-cylinder piston engine has a plurality  of c-shaped tubular members (19) each with a hollow interior  which has one end open and sealably mounted to a housing  (14) with an inlet (16) and outlet (18) with a passage (28) in  communication with the inlet and outlet and the hollow  interior.  a cam shaft (50) is rotatably mounted within the  convex area defined by each c-shaped member which operably  engages a pivotably mounted deflector panel (42) which  deflects a free end of the c-shaped member to change the  volume of the hollow interior which forces fluid through the  inlet into the passageway.  the deflector member also is movable  to disengage from the c-shaped member to decrease the  volume of the hollow interior and force fluid through the  outlet from the passageway.
