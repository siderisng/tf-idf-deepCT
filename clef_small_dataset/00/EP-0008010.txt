<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to an improved method for scan­ ning for flaws on a surface (5) utilizing a novel dynamic  averaging signal correction technique.  each individual scan  signal is divided into a large number of samples, each sam­ ple representing a predetermined position in the scan.  a  dynamic average is computed for each of the scan positions  by averaging samples from the same position of a predeter­ mined number of previously derived scan signals.  each  time a new scan line is scanned and divided into samples,  each sample is compared with its corresponding dynamic  average to provide a signal indicative of surface condition.   this technique is especially useful to detect flaws on high  quality tubing, such as used for nuclear reactor fuel rods  or for nuclear reactor steam generator tubing.
