<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a method of combating weeds  at a locus infested or liable to be infested with them,  which method comprises applying to the locus an effec­ tive of:   (a) one or more of 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethyl­ amino-1,3,5-triazine (trietazine), 2-chloro-4,6-di(ethyl­ amino)-1,3,5-triazine (simazine), 2-t-butylamino-4-ethyl­ amino-6-methylthio-1,3,5-triazine (terbutryne) and 3-(3-­ chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (metoxuron);  and   (b) n-(1-ethylpropyl)-2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine (pendi­ methalin).  in addition the invention provides a herbicidal com­ position comprising from 0. 05 to 95 % by weight in total  of (a) and (b), each of components (a) and (b) being pre­ sent in an amount of from 1 to 99 % by weight of the  total amount of those components which is present, in  association with a suitable carrier and/or surface active  agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention concerns a method of combating weeds, herbicidal compositions, and their preparation. the compounds trietazine, simazine, metoxuron and pendimethalin are each known herbicides. however, their herbicidal action when used individually is not always entirely satisfactory. we have found that the herbicidal action of these compounds is improved when they are used in certain combinations. accordingly, in one aspect, this invention provides a method of combating weeds at a locus infested or liable to be infested with them, which method comprises applying to the locus an effective amount of: (a) one or more of 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-1,3,5- triazine (trietazine), 2-chloro-4,6-di(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazine (simazine), 2 -t-butylaiino-4-ethylamino-methylthio-l '3, 5-triazine (terbutryne) and 3- (3-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl) -l,l-dimethylurea (metoxuron); and (b) n- (l-ethylpropyl) -2 ,6-dinjtro-3 ,4-xylidine (pendimethalin). in addition the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising from 0.05 to 955 by weight in total of (a) and orb), each of components (a) and (b) being present in an amount of from i to 99% by weight of the total amount of those components which is present, in association with a suitable carrier and/or surface active agent. it has been found that (a) and (b) seem to render weeds highly susceptible to the action of the other, so that the present method and composition are unexpectedly advantageous, especially when used in the control of weeds in crops. iiixtures of (a) and (b) are effective against weeds to a surprising degree. the method and composition can be used to combat a wider range of weed species than when either (a) or (b) is used alone. components (a) and (b) are also effective at lower dosage rates than those at which (a) or (b) alone is effective. in addition they are safe to many crops. component (a) preferably comprises just one of the three specified compounds, or a mixture of simazine and metoxuron. each of components (a) and (b) is preferably present in an amount of from 20 to 80%, especially 30 to 70%, by weight of the total amount of those components. where component (a) comprises a mixture of two or more of simazine and trietazine and terbutryne each is desirably present in an amount of from 10 to 80% by weight of that component. where component (a) is a mixture which includes metoxunon, however, the metoxuron is preferably present in an amount of from 80 to 95% by weight of that component. the compositiorls comprising (a) and cb) can be prepared by admixing the ingredients. usually, the compositions are initially produced in the form of concentrates containing 0.5 to 95%, preferably 1 to 85%,especially 10 to 50%, by weight in total of components (a) and cub), and these are diluted with water or a hydrocarbon for application, generally such that the concentration in total of the essential components (a) and (b) is 0.05 to 45 by weight. the carrier in the concentrate may be a solid, which may be finely divided. examples of suitable solids are limestone, clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite and sepiolite, and synthetic solid carriers, e.g.
