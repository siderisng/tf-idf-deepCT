<ABSTRACT>
filtration of coal digest can be greatly facilitated by liquid  phase extraction using an aromatic solvent oil of coal in at  least two stirred reactors in series.  control of residence time is  greatly enhanced, reducing or eliminating short residence  time digest components which increase filter cake resistivity  and long residence time components which have repolymerÂ­ ised and cause loss of yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
"coal digestion control" this invention is concerned with the liquid extraction of coal, more especially with the control of certain aspects of the extraction conditions in order to facilitate the separation of undissolved particles from the extract and to increase extraction yield. the technique of dissolving coal in liquid extractants, usually a heavy aromatic oil such as a coal tar fraction e.g. anthracene oil, or a highly aromatic petroleum fraction, is well established. considerable research has been effected on this technique in countries having indigenous coal reserves, especially since awareness of the impending "energy gap" became general. there is no great difficulty in achieving high extraction rates of coal in oil, of the order of 80 to 90% with hydrogenation. without hydrogenation, such high yields are more difficult to achieve due to the repolymerization of the dissolved coal. for the process to be economically viable it is important to obtain a high extraction yield. it is generally desirable to separate the undissolved matter before further processing, thus lowering the ash content and the sulphur content. the undissolved matter is mainly composed of mineral matter (ash) and certain insoluble carbonaceous substances especially that known as fusain. considerable difficulty, however, is experienced in this separation and a variety of methods have been advocated, including filtration, anti-solvent precipitation, centrifuges and gravity settling. the applicants believe that filtration offers the best compromise between processing costs, time and equipment costs. it has previously been suggested in british patent specification no. 1,090,556 that the extraction step in a hydrogenative liquid extraction of coal be controlled by considering the relative viscosity of the solution of coal and the solvent itself, and ceasing extraction, and hence transferring to a filtration step, at a minimum value of said relative viscosity. the viscosity of coal extracts or solutions varies considerably with time of extraction. the present applicants, in british patent specification no. 1,492,739, disclosed for the first time that the viscosity of coal extract was not necessarily the best criterion for deciding on extraction time, but filtration could be improved by controlling the digestion conditions to ensure that the filter cake had a constant and low specific resistivity. this had in general a more important effect on the ease of filtration than the viscosity of the coal extract. the applicants have now confirmed that good control over extraction is extremely important if rapid filtration is to be achieved. it has now been discovered that with a continuous coal extraction process, which would invariably be adopted in large scale commercial practice, there is a very substantial variation in residence time in a coal extraction reactor (digester). this is shown by fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings which clearly illustrates the distribution of residence time for a nominal 173 minute residence time, and it is important to note the peak at about eo minutes. fig. 1 was the result of tests using radioactive tracers injected into a pilot plant digester feed. it has also been established that there is a strong time
