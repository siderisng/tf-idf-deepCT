<ABSTRACT>
a contact element formed in one piece comprises  a pair of sinuous springs (28) extending from opposite  ends of a side of a channel shaped central section (12)  from the other side of which extensions (24) define a  centrally supported beam spring (20) having ends (22)  engageable with contact portions (38) at ends of the  springs (28).  in use a connector is formed by a slab-like  block of insulating material formed with cells opening to  opposite faces and each containing a contact element  (10).  the beam spring (20) of each element engages a  cell wall to flex ends (22) against the contacts (38).  conÂ­ tacts (38) of the sinuous springs project outwardly of the  block to engage contacts of substrates between which  the connector is sandwiched.
