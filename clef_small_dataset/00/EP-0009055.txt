<ABSTRACT>
this invention es directed to a thermosetting resin  composition comprising from 80 to 30 percent by weight of  a resin which es terminally unsaturated by vinyl groups and  from 20 to 70 percent by weight of an ethylenically unsatu­ rated monomer.  the invention is characterized in that the  ethylenically unsaturated monomer comprises from 5 to  90 percent by weight of a dicyclopentadiene alkenoate and  from 95 to 10 percent by weight of vinyl aromatic monomer.   the starting resins were prepared by reacting e.  g.  a poly­ epoxide resin with an ethylenically unsaturated monocar­ boxylic acid.  the thermosetting resin composition is useful  in preparing laminates, molded articles and coatings.
