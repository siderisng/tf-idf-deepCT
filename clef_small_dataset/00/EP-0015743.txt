<ABSTRACT>
a pourer attachment for use in a non-return valve fitment  for a container comprising a one-piece moulding having outer  (1) and inner (4) annular walls, the outer annular wall (1) having  means (2) for egagement therewith of complementary means  on a closure cap whereby the cap may be attached to the pour­ er attachment, the inner annular wall (4) defining a pouring out­ let (5), and the outer and inner annular walls defining between  them an annular well (9).  in a preferred embodiment the outer  extremity (7) of the inner annular wall stands proud of the outer  extremity (8) of the outer annular wall, so that when a closure  cap is applied to the attachment a primary seal is obtained be­ tween the top of the inner wall and the inside of the top of the  cap.

<DESCRIPTION>
"pourer attachment" this invention relates to pourer attachments for containers, and especially to an attachment forming a component of a non-refillable fitment. non-refillable fitments are known, their purposes being to allow the free flow of fluid from the container but to prevent the re-filling or "topping-up" thereof. they find considerable use in the spirits trade, and ensure that containers filled with spirits, and thereafter provided with a non-refillable fitment, cannot be tampered with to the extent that some of the spirit is removed from the container and replaced with a different, for example a diluting, liquid. a well-known nonrefillable fitment comprises a simple one-way ball valve, suitably made from a plastics material such as polystyrene, having an inlet situated within the neck of the container, a screw-threaded outlet and an annular flange between the inlet and outlet, which rests upon a sealing washer seated on the rim portion of the container mouth. the ball itself is particularly of glass, stainless steel, ceramic or plastics material. the fitment is held captive on the container by means of an external metal cowl, an upper annular surface of which firmly presses the flange of the fitment against the washer and that in turn against the rim of the container when the skirt portion of the cowl is conformed to an annular recess or bead formed on the container neck below the rim portion. the closure is completed by a threaded cap, suitably of a plastics material, which is screwed onto the screw-threaded outlet-portion of the valve fitment. it has recently become popular to provide wine and spirit containers with caps of the "tamperproof" or "pilferproof" variety. such caps are made from thin-guage metal such as aluminium, and have a cylindrical skirt an upper portion of which is screw-threadedly attached to a screw-thread on the container neck, and a lower edge of which is rolled into an annular recess or beneath an annular bead formed on the container neck below the screwthread. between the upper and lower portions of the skirt is a circumferential line of weakening, which may for example take the form of a tear-strip, or normally, a series of spaced bridges and slots, whereby the upper skirt portion, may, in order to open the container, be separated from the lower skirt portion, often referred to as a security ring. we have recently provided a container with both a nonrefillable fitment and a metal pilferproof cap, and such is described in british patent application no.932/77. according to that specification the non-return valve is held tightly on the container by means of the outer pilferproof-cap being crimped into an annular recess formed on the outer part (or pourer attachment) of the valve and beneath an annular bead or shoulder formed on the container. the non-return or one-way valve is normally made up of three components, namely an inner component seated within the neck of the container, an outer component attached thereto, and a movable valve member, such as a ball, which is movable

claims:      1.    a pourer attachment for use in a non-return valve fitment for a container which comprises a one-piece moulding having outer and inner annular walls, the outer annular wall having means for engagement therewith of complementary means on a closure cap whereby said cap may be attached to said pourer attachment, the inner annular wall defining a pouring outlet, and the outer and inner annular walls defining between them an annular well.    2. a pourer attachment as claimed in claim 1 wherein the outer extremity of the inner annular wall stands proud of the outer extremity of the outer annular wall, so that when a closure cap is applied to the attachment a primary seal is obtained between the top of the inner wall and the inside of the top of the cap.   3. a pourer attachment as claimed in claim 1 wherein the inner and outer walls are of the same height and a sealing wad or disc situated between the top of the inner wall and the cap forms a primary seal.   4. a pourer attachment as claimed in claim 1, substantially as described with reference to the drawing.   5. a non-refillable fitment for a container comprising inner and outer members joined together with a movable valve member retained therebetween, characterised in that the outer member is a pourer attachment as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4.
