<ABSTRACT>
cable lug with spring, which is suitable for repeated operation, requires low insertion and extraction forces and, in so doing, nonetheless ensures a relatively high contact force.  the cable lug with spring consists of a u-shaped forked part, with a conductor and an insulation fork (2, 1) and a spring part (3).  the spring part (3) has a u-shaped spring arm base (5) in an extension of the forked part and spring arms (9, 10), extending forwards, which in each case are bent backwards and inwards in the end region (12) towards one another up to the contact region (13).  at the contact region (13) there are connected guide tabs (17, 18), running towards the rear.  the novel cable lug with spring is characterised in that the spring arm base (5) has a stabilizing crease (6), stamped through to the exterior and running in a u-shape, and the spring arms (9, 10) have an outward bend (11) in connection to the limb (7, 8).  the novel cable lug with spring can be used with and without an internal spring.  the effective spring arms (9, 10) are relatively long, calculated from the join, and in this way result in advantageous spring paths.  <image>
