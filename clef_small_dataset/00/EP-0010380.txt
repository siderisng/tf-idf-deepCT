<ABSTRACT>
a transmission control lever is movable from a no-drive  position (iii) to a number of drive positions (vi, vii, ri, rii) and  a braking system (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 63, 64, 66) is  provided for braking the ground engaging means.  a starting  circuit (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 21a) is also provided which includes a  starter (17) and an ignition switch (21) which must be moved  to a start position (st) when it is desired to energize the starter  and which occupies a running position (run) when the prime  mover is running.  an interlock system (74, 75, 67, 62, 66, 23,  24) is included which ensures that with the switch (21) in the  start position, the starter (17) can only be operated when the  transmission control lever is in the no-drive position and, with  the switch (21) in its start or running position, the transmssion  control lever cannot be moved from its no-drive position to  any of its drive positions until the braking system is operative.

<DESCRIPTION>
vehicle with trans:vission interlock background of the invention this invention relates to the control of transm.issicns and particularly, though not exclusively, to the control of transmissions in heavy construction machines, such as excavators or the like, in which the transmission comprises a mechanical transmission element in series with a hydraulic transmission element. in particular the invention is concern -ed with controlling the starting process so that the vehicle remains under control during starting and immediately thereafter. summary of the invention according to the present invention there is provided a vehicle having a prime mover, ground engaging means by which said vehicle can be moved over the ground, a transmission connecting said prime mover to said ground engaging means, transmission control means means movable from a no-drive position to a nuj-,ber of drive positions, a braking system for braking said ground engaging means, a prime mover starting circuit including a prime mover starting means and switch means which must be moved to a start position when it is desired to energize said starting means and which occupies a running position when said prime mover is running following starting, and an interlock system connecting both said starting circuit and said braking system to said control means to ensure that: : i) with said switch means in said start position said starting circuit is only operative to energize said starting means when said control means is in said no-drive position, and ii) with said switch means in said start or said rig position said control r-,eans cannot be moved fron said no-drive position to any one of said drive positions until said braking system is operative to brake said ground engaging means. as will be appreciated a vehicle fitted with the inter- lock system of the present invention is particularly safe since it cannot be started except when the transmission is in a no-drive condition and further the transmission control means cannot be moved to select a drive condition until the braking system is shown to be operative. this latter feature is particularly important when the braking system is fluid pressure operated since it prevents the operator driving the vehicle until the braking system has core up to pressure following starting. in a vehicle having a ifuid pressure operated braking system a braking system pressure level sensing means is included in the interlock system to ensure that with said switch means in said start or said running position the control means cannot be moved from said no-drive position to any one of said drive posit- ions until said braking system pressure has reached a rre- determined level at which said braking system is operative to brake said ground engaging means. in order to allow starting should the prime mover be stopped in a drive condition a further electrical circuit may be provided to partially override said interlock system to enable said control means to be moved from any one of; 2 said drive. positions to said no-drive position when said prime mover is
