<ABSTRACT>
A device for supporting two a working wave pair of a tape framework driving pivot shafts (2) during a working wave change is made of one of the height after adjustable bearing for the two superimposed pantold shafts (2), which for self-releasing the clutches connecting them with the drive shafts in theirLength shortens are bar.In order to automate the clutch operation on the one hand and on the other hand to enable the use of only liftable extensions, the bearings are formed as supporting (12) for the liftable joint shafts (2), wherein the supports (12) are comparatively adjusted and together with their adjustment drive (16,17) store at one of the height after adjustable frame (21).
