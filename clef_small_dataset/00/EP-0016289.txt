<ABSTRACT>
a positive displacement pump system has two delivery  passages (11,12) communicating under the control of a valve  (13) with a main discharge passage (15) and/or an over-spill  duct (14).  the valve comprises a valve member (20) slidably  mounted in a valve bore and the valve member has lands and  intermediate recesses controlling communication between  the delivery passages and the overspill duct.  the pressures  upstream and downstream of a discharge orifice (17) in the  discharge passage are applied to the valve member in opposi­ tion to each other, increase of the pressure drop tending to  move the valve member to increase the amount of fluid pas­ sed to the overspill duct.  to overcome the known tendency for  a valve member to be subjected by the hydraulic forces to a  large closing force when the valve is open to only a small  extent, the valve is designed to provide for a relatively large  opening force at least when the valve is commencing to open.   in one construction this is achieved by passing the flow from  the second to the main discharge duct through the valve  member in a manner producing a jet reaction on the valve  member to assist the normal regulating force on the member.   in alternative arrangements the additional force is derived  from an additional pressure drop induced in the flow from the  delivery passage, the higher pressure being applied to valve  member in a sense to increase the amount of fluid passed to  overspill.

<DESCRIPTION>
"positive displagement pump systems" this invention relates to positive displacement pump systems. according to the present invention there is provided a positive displacement pump system having a first pressure fluid delivery passage connected to a main discharge passage containing a discharge orifice, a second pressure fluid delivery passage connected to the first delivery passage under the control of 2 valve comprising a. valve member sli.dably mounted in a valve bore, said valve member having applied to it a force derived from the pressure drop across said orifice and operating in response to an increase of said pressure drop above a predetelmined value to move the valve member to clause fluid from the first and second delivery passages to be by-passed through an overspill port as the said pressure drop increases, and means for superimposing on the valve member an additional force which is derived from the delivery pressure in one of said delivery passages and which operates in the same sense as the first said force. preferably said additional force varies as the square of the fluid delivery pressure from which it is derived in one embodiment of the invention, the pressure fluid from the second delivery passage flows through an axial duct extending through a part of the lent of the valve member and opening through an axially facing port in the valve member to join the flow through the first delivery passage, the reaction force of the flow emerging from said port constituting said additional force. preferably the end portion of the axial duct terminating in said port is of convergent cross-section thereby to form a nozzle. in another embodiment of the invention, said one end portion of the valve has a reduced diameter extension which forms with the valve bore an annular restriction between the first fluid delivery passage and the main discharge passage, the pressure upstream of the orifice being applied to the annu,ar area of the valve member formed at the location of the reduction of diameter, and the pressure of the fluid at the upstream end of the annular restriction is applied to the end face of the reduced diameter extension thereby to provide said additional force. some embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with referenfe to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which: figures 1, 2 and 3 respectively illustrate in partial cross-section three pump systems according to the invention. in the drawings similar components are indicated by corresponding reference numerals. mne form of positive displacement pumping mechanism indicated generally at 10 is not material to the invention but the pump is required to deliver pressure fluid to first and second delivery passages 11, 12 which are in communication with each other under the control of a control valve 13. the combined flow from passages 11 and 12, less any which is surplus to the immediate requirements of-tne external circuit and which is directed to an overspill port 14 in the valve and thence to a fluid reservoir
