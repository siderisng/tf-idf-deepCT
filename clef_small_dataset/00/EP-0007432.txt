<ABSTRACT>
a rearview device is integrated within a helmet and pres­ ents an objective o₁, an eyepiece o₃ and means for optically  coupling together said elements, comprising either optical  fibres f or an intermediate objective o₂, and at least a mirror  m.  moreover, the mirror is of the roof type configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
application for patent under the european patent convention title: rearview device incorporable in heliflets and the like description the present invention relates to a rearview device incorporable in helmets and the like, for example in protective helmets used by motorcyclists and for sports in general, with particular reference to,but without any limitation to protective helmets. the increasa in road traffic presently causes all vehicle drivers when undertaking a manoeuvre, e.g. when turning or overtaking, to locate exactly all the vehicles that follow or precede. the rearview mirrors applied inside the vehicle enable the driver, by means of a slight inclination of the head, to explore rearwards a field covering an angle of about 300 and to observe the vehicles in the field of vision. generally these rearview mirrors are integrated by a second rearview mirror, applied externally to the vehicle, the field of which completes that of the first rearview mirror, permitting the driver to "follow", for a few instants, the vehicles that are overtaking him. besides these various advantages, said devices present, however, some inconveniences i.e.: - their field vision is fixed and dependent on the direction of movement of the vehicle; - the protrusion of the external rearview mirror makes this a fragile and dangerous accessory; - the observation through the rearview mirror demands an inclination of the head with consequent momentary abandonment of the direct vision of the objects situated in front of the driver. in the case of two-wheeled vehicles, i.e. motorbicycles and motorcycles, the rearview mirror is fixed to the handle,whereby all the inconveniences cited hereabove occur. the present invention concerns a rearview device the essential characteristics of which consists in the fact that it can be integrated within the helmet which protects the driver's head and is able to offer, on the models presently in use, the following advantages: a) the field of vision towards the rear may be ampli fied at will by means of a simple orientation of the driver's 3:lyad; b) the use of protruding, fragile or dangerous members or parts is not required; c) the image is observed in proximity of the normal vision axis, with the overlapping or juxtaposition of the objects located in front and seen without the aid of the device; d) this device may be easily fitted to any type of helmet maintaining practically unaltered the structural strength of the helmet. the rearview device presents supporting means which may be fitted to the helmet and which support, in the rear part of the helmet, an objective the optical axis of which is generally horizontal, and in the front part, at least an eyepiece, and presents means to optically connect the objective and the eyepiece so as to permit the vision of the rear objects. according to this invention, the optical elements of the rearview device form an objective which provides, in its focal plane, an image of the rear objects which are to be observed and an eyepiece which permits the observation of said image according

 claims   1. a rearview device for helmets in general and for pro  tective helmets in particular, characterized in that  it presents supporting means which may be fixed to the  structure of the helmet and holding, in the rear part  of the helmet, an objective the optical axis of which  is generally horizontal, and in the front part at least  one eyepiece and means for optically coupling said eye  piece and said objective in order to permit a "true"  vision of the objects situated in the rear.   2; a rearview device according to claim 1, characterized  in that the means utilized for optically coupling said  eyepiece and said objective comprises an optical fibre  the inlet face of which is   situated    in the focal plane  of the image of the objective while the outlet face is  combined with an intermediate objective to transfer the  enlarged image in the focal plane of the eyepiece, while  a plane mirror reflects the image in the vision direc  tion.   3. a rearview device according to claim 1, characterized  in that said means for optically coupling said eyepiece  and said objective comprise reflecting and/or refrac  ting means collocated one with respect to the other ir  such a manner as to obtain a reflection and the recti  fication of the image in the vision direction.   4. a rearview device according to   claim    3, characterized  in that it comprises at least one mirror and 8 double    mirror the reflecting surfaces of which are collocated  almost at right angles.   5. a rearview device according to one or more of any of the  preceding claims 1 through 4 characterized in that the  supporting means fixed to the structure of the helmet  support a double optical system the branches of which are  situated parallel to each other and symmetrically with re  spect to the median plane of the helmet, the elements of  said branches being placed apart at a distance generally  corresponding to the average distance between the eyes  of a human, thus ensuring a binocular vision of the image  observed.    6. a protective helmet characterized in that it comprises a  rearview device according to any one or more of claims 1  to 5.      7.    a helmet according to   claim    6 characterized in that the  optical axis of the objective-eyepiece system, according  to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 5, is situated  in the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the helmet or  in a position which is equidistant from said plane.
