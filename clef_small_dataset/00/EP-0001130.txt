<ABSTRACT>
1.  three-pressure control valve for use on an indirectly acting compressed air brake comprising : - a filling and isolating element (c) comprising - a first spring-loaded piston (20, 21) which is loaded on one side by the brake cylinder pressure and on the other side by atmospheric pressure ; - a second spring-loaded piston (30) which is loaded on one side by the control cylinder pressure and on the other side by the pressure in the main air line ; - a piston rod (22) which on one side is fixed to the first piston (20) and on the other side to a valve disc (62) which together with a valve seat (69) on the second piston (3) forms a first valve (61) for filling the control cylinder (33) ; - a stop (67) fitted to the piston rod (22) in order to transmit the brake cylinder pressure to the second piston (30) ; characterised in that - the filling isolating element (c) having a second valve (28) which can be actuated by the second piston (30) ; - the first valve has a cylindrical throttle body (71), which protrudes into a throttle orifice (70) and can be displaced relative to the throttle orifice and the central part of which has a similar diameter than the two ends.
