<ABSTRACT>
1.   a two-cycle internal combustion engine, comprising at least one transfer channel connecting the pump casing to the cylinder chamber, of the type in which said transfer channel is formed of a tube one end of which is adapted to an opening foreseen in the casing and the other end of which is adapted to an opening foreseen in the cylinder, wherein said tube has a length such that it is capable of being the seat of vibratory phenomena for the gas column it contains, said vibratory phenomena being likely to cause a limitation of the power when the engine is running at high speed.
