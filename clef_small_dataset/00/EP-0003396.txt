<ABSTRACT>
an electrically ignited load such as a fusehead (40) is  connected to the secondary winding (52) of a transformer.   the secondary winding is magnetically linked to a primary  winding (54) through a magnetic circuit and the transformer  is constructed so as to provide a substantial leakage  inductance associated with the secondary winding and  effectively connected in series with the load (30) to be  ignited.  the structure selectively passes electrical ignition  energy to the load only in response to input electrical energy  having predetermined magnitude and frequency characteristics.
