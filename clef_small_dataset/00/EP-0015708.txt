<ABSTRACT>
a system for restraining forward movement of an occu足 pant of a motor vehicle seat comprises a chest pad 18 on an  arm 16 which is pivotable about a transverse axis 20 behind  and below the seat, together with a lap restraint in the form of  an arm 10 having a padded portion 12 which extends across  the user's lap.  the arm 10 is pivotally mounted on a transverse  axis 24 located near the front of the seat.  a lever 26 is fast with  the arm 16 and a lever 28 is fast with the arm 10.  a roller 32 en足 gages confronting surfaces 34 and 36 on the arms 26 and 28.   when the roller 32 is in the position shown, forward movement  of the arm 16 causes relatively little backward movement of the  arm 10 so that the occupant can lean forward in his seat with足 out forcing the bar on the arm 10 into his lap.  if, due to sudden  decceleration of the vehicle, the occupant moves forward in  his seat, lifting the padded portion 12, the roller 32 shoots for足 wards into engagement with stop surface 38.  the velocity ratio  of the coupling between the arms 10 and 16 has now changed  so that subsequent forward movement of the padded portion  12 is approximately equal to the resulting backward movement  of the lap restraint means on the arm 10 and the occupant is  held in his seat.
