<ABSTRACT>
the optical mixing-demixing is effected, as regards  the mixing operation, by suitably sending two light beams  having different wavelengths to a first separation surface  between transparent materials having suitable behaviours  of the refractive index.  the obtained multiple beam, with a  third beam having a different wavelength is then sent to a  second separation surface between transparent materials  having different suitable behaviours of the refractive index,  obtaining an only beam; the operation is repeated till all  the beams are mixed.  for demixing operation, the beam  formed by a plurality of beams, having different wavelengths  is suitably sent to a first separation surface between  transparent materials having suitable behaviours of  the refractive index and an only monochromatic beam is  drown out.  the resulting beam is then sent to a second  separation surface between transparent materials having  different suitable behaviours of the refractive index, for  drawing out a second monochromatic beam; the operation  is repeated until all the beams are demixed.
