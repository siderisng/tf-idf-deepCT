<ABSTRACT>
an electric switch has two pushbuttons (14, 16) for  rocking a pivotal actuator (18) alternately in opposite di足 rections for alternately closing contacts.  the pivotal ac足 tuator (18) is snap-in assembled to a switch frame (12) which  is snap-in assembled to a switch base (10) that supports  the contacts.  the two pushbuttons are alike and are guided  in their vertical reciprocal motion by the switch frame and  by one another.  to allow use of minimum height push足 buttons while having ample finger-engaging surface, the  pushbuttons are provided with like but complementary  guiding structures (14c) integrally molded thereon to guide  one another in their relative vertically reciprocal move足 ments without binding with respect to one another or the  switch frame.
