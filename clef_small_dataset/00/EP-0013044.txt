<ABSTRACT>
l-1-hydroxymethyl alkaneamide derivatives of -l-aspar­ tic acid have been prepared and have been discovered to be  non-nutritive sweeteners having favorable chemical and  physiological properties for use in compositions ingested  orally.  the compounds have the general formula    wherein r₁ =   h,h-, or   ch₃-, r² = h or ch₃; r³ = h or ch₃;  and r⁴ = ch₃, c₂h₅, i - c₃h₇ or t-c₄h₉; except that where r⁴ is  i-c₃h₇ or t-c₄h₉, r² and r³ are h.

<DESCRIPTION>
l-aspartyl amide derivatives and their use as sweetening agents the most widely used natural sweetener for food and similar preparations is sucrose. sucrose is safe, naturally occurring, and has a hicjh sweetners wuality, i.e., a pure, quick onset with no aftertaste or undertaste. one drawback to the use of sucrose as a sweetener is its caloric content. persons atho have diabetes must carefully control their intake cf sugar to avoid problems associated with the disease. persons who have excess eight must use nonnutritive sweeteners since the use of sucrose leads to weight gain rather than weight control or reduction. a second drawback to sucrose is that it is cariogenic and therefore cannot be used in dentifrices and is undesirable in chewing gums. a third drawback is that sucrose does not have a sufficiently high sweetness intensity for some compositions, e.g. dentifrices. if enough sucrose is used to make the composition sweet, the product becomes tacky and hygroscopic. additionally, for the amount of sweetness delivered, sucrose is expensive. it can be appreciated that the search continues for compounds which have high sweetness intensity and quality, are non-nutritive, and are safe for oral consumption. numerous compounds have been discovered which are non-nutritive sweeteners. however, most have drawbacks of one sort or another. sodium cyclamate has been banned for oral use because it ma be carcinogenic or mutagenic. saccharin is also being questioned as a possible carcinogen; additionally, saccharin has a bitter aftertaste. neohesperidine dihydrochalcone has 900 times the sweetness of sucrose; however, the sweetness is slow to develop and there is a licorice-like aftertaste. aspartame a dipeptide, )ias a high quality sweetness of approximately 150 times sucrose, but hydrolyzes in aqueous solution to its non-sweet component amino acids. other aspartic acid derivatives are sweet but hydrolyze in the gastrointes- tinal tract to release ptnt vasopressors. non-nutritive sweeteners have been known for almost one hundred years (saccharin, 1879) and theories have been proposed to account for the perception of sweetness and the chemical structures that produce that perception. yet, there seems to be no common molecular property which can be used to predict either the level or, especially, the quality of sweetness. ingenious models have been proposed to explain the sweetness of knorn compounds, but not all compounds fitting the models are sweet and the theories cannot be used to predict or construct new sweeteners. the prediction of the quality of sweetness, as well as the intensity of sweetness, appears to remain a complete mystery. the compounds of the present invention, l-l-hydroe methyl alkaneamide derivatives of -l-aspartic acid, have not previously been prepared. it has now been discovered that, surprisingly, the compounds are sweet and are phsiologicallxt safe for oral use in sweetening amounts, even though similar alkaneamide derivatives have drug activity. the compounds of the present invention do not have a labile ester linkage and so are much more stable in aqueous solution than dipeptides such as l-aspartyl-l phenylalanine methyl ester. additionally, the preferred compound disclosed herein also has a sweetness quality
