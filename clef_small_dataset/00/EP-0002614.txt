<ABSTRACT>
in a system in which compressed ethylene is scheduled  to flow through pipes, and in which there is danger of  decomposition of ethylene and danger of the spreading of a  reaction boundary of the exothermic decomposition reaction,  a method and means are provided for quenching the  advancement of the decomposition.  ethylene is directed  from large diameter pipes into an array of spaced apart small  diameter tubes (153) which are not overheated when subjected  to the combination of head and tail boundaries of the  advancing plug of decomposition products.  such overheating  of the tubes by the leading and trailing flames can be  prevented by cooling the exterior of the tubes with a fluid  normally maintained at about ambient temperature, thereby  cooling the compressed ethylene sufficiently to quench the  decomposition reaction.
