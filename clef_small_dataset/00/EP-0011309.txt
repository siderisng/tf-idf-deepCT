<ABSTRACT>
In a closure lid for pipe sockets, a DEC Kelinneileil (9) with a radially protruding sealing flange (11) and a cross-comprehensive outer cap (1) is releasably connected to each other by latching means. The rast metal comprise radially inwardly from the cap wall (3) radially inwardly, the sealing flange (11) undergoing protrusions (13) each with a radially inwardly and to the capbo the (2) directed tracking surface (14) and one to the system at the Sealing flange (11) Specific support surface (15). This is carved starting from the radially inner end of the inner white (14) convex to the cap wall (3), wherein the sealing flange (11) rests with its edge on the support surface (15). As a result, the outer cap (1) can be blown out in the operation of a force of predetermined size from the lidnin portion (9) and impaired the closing function of the lidny part part (9) closing the pipe socket are avoided by the acting force.
