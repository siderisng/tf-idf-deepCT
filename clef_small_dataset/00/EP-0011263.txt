<ABSTRACT>
The aerosol product, for example a pharmaceutical or cosmetic preparation, contains active ingredient, trunk agents and solvents, where das exerts propellants for defensive damage to the environment and the users of finally from helium, neon, argon, krypton or gemi there. Particularly favorable is a proportion of argon of at least 80 wt. %, based on the total weight of the propellant. The method consists essentially that active ingredient and solvents are rinished in a pressure vessel, whereby a compressed noble gas is added and then collected that. The mixing process can be repeated in white pressure vessels with different noble gases. The device comprises mixing boilers (1, 2; 3) for storing active ingredient and solvent, which as well as a pressure champion (12a) for noble gas to be connected to a pressure vessel ter (12), in which an outlet nozzle (14) at a distance from the Floor is arranged. It may be provided with the pressure vessels (15, 18), as well as a ker zen filter (22, 10a) behind the last pressure vessel (18) and / or before the first pressure vessel (12).
