<ABSTRACT>
The process is characterized mainly by the use of calcium sulphate semi-hydrates, particularly in the alpha form, that is to say a product having qualities of taking, curing, sequestration and retention.These products allow to sequester the hydrocarbon particles.After curing the one seems resulting for example in the form of a plate is perfectly cleared.The method applies in particular to the fight against pages pollution by the hydrocarbons rejected at sea. The method is carried out by means of a positive signal comprising a set (1) for spreading the aforementioned binder and a set (2) To brew the said binder with the hydrocarbon layer, said device being mounted on two wheels (5) for example and hugged, by the intermediate intermediate of a ball connecting (4), to a mobile machine such as onetruck.
