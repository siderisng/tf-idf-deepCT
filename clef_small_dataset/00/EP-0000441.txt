<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a device for extracting energy  from waves on a liquid, the device having a chamber (14)  with an opening for the flow of liquid into and out of the  chamber to provide a quantity of the liquid which is arranged  to oscillate in the chamber to provide energy from these  oscillations.  in order to maximise the energy absorption  efficiency of the device, that portion of the device to be  submerged and lie in a vertical plane aligned in the direction  of propagation of the waves is of asymmetric shape,  and the device is arranged to be held in a manner to inhibit  movement of the device itself in response to the waves.
