<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for spreading fibres uniformly over a con­ veyor has separate fibre distributors (10, 12) which deposit  dry fibres onto a conveyor belt (22) through foraminous  discharge outlets (29).  fibrous mat produced on the travelling conveyor belt  (22) by discharge from a first distributor (10) tends to bunch  or fluff up between this and the next distributor.  to prevent  this, the distributors (10, 12) have their outlets (29) open  to a common, substantially sealed tunnel (26) through which  the conveyor belt (22) travels.  the tunnel top (46) between  the distributors (10, 12) is perforated and its bottom is ex­ posed to a partial vacuum whereby a downward air flow  is created between the distributors (10, 12) which holds  the mat onto the belt (22).
