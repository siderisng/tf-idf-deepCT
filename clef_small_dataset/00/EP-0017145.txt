<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing multi-layered tubes wound out of Miminde two metal strips, each of which a metal strip layer is wrapped spirally and each further metal strip layer is offset from the predictive direction in the axial direction, and intermediate material is introduced during the winding process between the individual metal strip layers through which proceeds against gases and liquids density, chemicals consistent and optionally food-free raw re-made from lower weight can be made as casting tubes so that as an intermediate layer between the individual metal strip layers and as surface coating material in a particularly economical way, an art resin can be used by the metal bands be bent in heated state approximately in their circular arc shape, wherein during the winding process between the metal strip inner layer and the metal band outline, a contiguous resin layer GESC Heaps is applied and in the formation of the pipe inner surface to this a kun resin layer is applied, with a first activation already carried out during creating the resin layers, while the outer surface of the tube is then provided with a synthetic resin layer, and then an end activation of all synthetic resin layers takes place.
