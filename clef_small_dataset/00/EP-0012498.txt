<ABSTRACT>
an escalator drive comprises a main driving motor (11)  operable, in normal use of the escalator, to drive the step-­ band (15) of the escalator continuously through reduction  gearing (12).  an auxiliary motor (21) can be operated to  advance the step-band (15) in a series of non-continuous  movements when the main motor (11) is inoperative.  the  auxiliary motor (21) has a power supply which is indepen­ dent of the main motor power supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
escalator auxiliary drive this invention relates to an auxiliary drive for an escalator. heavy-duty versions of such escalators are in use particularly on underground railway stations, and the invention is especially - although not exclusively applicable to escalators of the heavy-duty publicservice type. the design of heavy-duty public-service type escalators for railway stations in the united kingdom is governed by the requirements of the railway inspectorate. these requirements are fairly stringent, but are increasingly being adopted by other countries. one such requirement is that -the escalator must be capable of being brought to a halt, and held there1 for use as a stationary staircase. another requirement is that, where the escalator is the sole means of access, from one floor (or level) to another, it must be possible to inspect the escalator driving gear and transmission, and to service them, by working mainly from underneath the escalator and with a minimum use of overhead tackle which might obstruct the escalator stairway. when a breakdown occurs, or when for any other reason the escalator is temporarily brought to a halt, it is also essential to be able to advance the step-band a little at a time at, say, one-eighth or one-tenth normal driving speed, in order to carry out repairs and to check the repairs before bringing the escalator back into service. the endless stairway or step-band of any escalator is normally continuously driven by an electric motor. it is traditional for this electrically-powered driving motor, and its transmission, to be situated well beneath the head of the escalator stairway. in the particular case of a public-service underground railway escalator, the motor and transmission gear are quite literally located underground in a "machine room", which is excavated beneath the head of the escalator and to which access is gained through a hatch in the floor leading away from the stairway head. when the step-band is brought to a halt, and the driving motor is de-energised, the step-band can then be advanced a little at a time; but only by an engineer entering the machine room and "hand-winding" the transmission. conventionally the drive motor is permanently coupled to the transmission, and so the motor shaft is hand-rotated. to carry out this hand-winding technique, one man has to rotate the transmission down in the machine room; a second man, who can actually observe the step-band of the escalator throughout its length, must stand at the head of the escalator stairway; and a third man must be positioned by the hatch which gives access to the machine room, to take instructions from the man at the head of the escalator stairway and to relay them to the man in the machine room who then hand-winds the transmission by the instructed amount. accordingly, at least three men are needed to carry out hand-winding safely; and at least one of them (the man in the machine room) must be a practised engineer. in addition, the need to excavate and fit out the machine room adds considerably

<CLAIMS>
claims:    1. an escalator drive comprising a main driving motor operable, in normal use of the escalator, to drive the step-band of the escalator continuously through reduction gearing, characterised by the provision of an auxiliary motor (21) which can be operated to advance the step-band (15) in a series of non-continuous movements when the main motor (11) is inoperative, and in that said motor (21) has a power supply independent of the main motor (11) power supply.    2. an escalator drive according to claim 1, characterised by the provision of means (18) which, when the main motor   (11)    drives the step-band (15) normally, either automatically uncouples the drive (19, 23, 12) from the auxiliary motor (21) to the step-band (15), or automatically cuts out the power supply to the auxiliary motor (21).    3. an escalator drive according to claim 2, characterised in that the said means (18) comprises a clutch which is interposed between the auxiliary motor (21) and its drive line (12) and which automatically disengages the auxiliary motor   (?1)    from the drive line (12) whenever the main motor (11) is operative.    4. an escalator drive according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the auxiliary motor (21) drives the step-band (15) through the same reduction gearing (12) as that through which the main motor (11) drives the step-band (15).    5. an escalator drive according to claim 4, characterised in that the output shaft of the main motor (11) protrudes from two opposite ends of the main motor housing;   in-that    one protruding end of that shaft is coupled to the reduction gearing (12) which  drives the step-band (15); and in that the other protruding end (23) of the main motor output shaft drives the clutch means (18) to which the auxiliary motor (21) is coupled.     6. an escalator drive according to claim 5, characterised in that the main motor (11), the auxiliary motor (21) and the reduction gearing (12) are all situated within the head truss of the escalator.    7. an escalator drive according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that one or more electrical sockets (26,27) is located at the head and/or the foot of the escalator stairway, so that the power supply to the auxiliary motor (21) can be controlled by a box   (28)    adapted to be detachably plugged into said socket or sockets (26, 27).    8. an escalator drive substantially as described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.
