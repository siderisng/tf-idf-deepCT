<ABSTRACT>
frame structure comprising main beams and transverse  beams to be used in carriages of compact storage systems,  i. e.  carriages supporting shelves, movable on rails towards  and away from each other to form passageways between the  shelves.  the main beams and transverse beams are joined by a  snap action mechanism which is an integral part of the beams.   the transverse beams (32) are mainly u-shaped and their legs  (32b) are provided with hooks (35, 36), whereas the waist (32a)  has a groove (38) extending perpendicular to the length direc­ tion of the beam.  each main beam (31) has a vertical leg (31a),  intended to abut one end of the transverse beam (32), and a  horizontal leg (31b), having at its end a bent portion (34) to  engage the groove (38).  the vertical leg (31a) has a number of  slots (33) perpendicular to the length direction of the beam to  receive the hooks (35, 36) of the transverse beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
frame structure comprising main beams and transverse beams and method of mounting such structure this invention relates to a frame structure comprising profiled main beams and transverse beams of metal or the like and to a method of mounting such structure. it is previously known to build up load-bearing frame structures or the like by joining main beams and transverse beams by weld, rivet or screw joints. for instance such structures are used in carriages in storage systems of the so-called compact type. these carriages are movable on rails and support shelves, compartments or the like on which goods may be stored. by moving the carriages to different positions adjacent each other or spaced from each other one can form passageways between adjacent shelves. the systems are very space-saving and have therefore become widely used. however, the known systems have the drawback that the carriages are expensive to manufacture because joining of the beams is time-consuming. in order to get a rational manufacturing of the system in spite of this the joining operation usually is concentrated to one single place in a large geografic area on which large investment in the form of automatic spotwelding machines, assembly lines and so on is made. however, this kind of rationalizing effect is partly decreased by the heavy transport charges following on the low weight-volume relation for the carriages. the purpose of this invention is to achieve a frame structure, for instance a carriage, of the type described above, which by a particular design of the beams can be simply and rapidly assembled, the beam joints being such that self-locking is achieved. since no expensive tools are necessary for the mounting operation, this can be done more locally than before. this means that the beams can be stowed together and be transported directly from a factory to an area where they are to be assembled, without involving too high transportation costs. the invention also gives the possibility of reducing the storing costs for the carriages since the system is very flexible. thus, carriages of suitable length and width can be built up from a few standardized components. an upper limit of the length of the carriages with respect to the space available is often set in systems of the described type. this adjustment of the length is very simple to make when using this invention and it is realized by cutting the main beams from their standard lengths to the lengths in question. the advantages described are achieved by the invention as defined in the following claims. some embodiments of the invention will now be described in connection with the drawings in which fig. 1 schematically in a perspective view shows a carriage provided with load-carrying shelves, fig. 2 in a side elevation view shows the connection between a main beam and a transverse beam before assembly, and fig. 3 in the same view shows these beams after being assembled. fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along the line iv - iv
