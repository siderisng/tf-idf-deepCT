<ABSTRACT>
a process for the removal of pyrite from coal which com­ prises preparing an aqueous slurry containing finely-divided  coal particles; adding to the slurry an alkali metal hydroxide  selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide,  potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, as well as mix­ tures thereof, in amounts sufficient to continously maintain  the ph of the slurry at a value of below about 8; agitating the  slurry while treating the slurry with oxygen or an oxygen-­ containing gas to convert the pyrite in the coal to a soluble  alkali metal sulfate; reacting lime with the so-formed alkali  metal sulfate to regenerate the alkali metal hydroxide (12) and  then recycling the hydroxide for use in the process.
