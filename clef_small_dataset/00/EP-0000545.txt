<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing a semiconductor device with improved self-adjustment, in particular an insulating layer field effect transistor with a self-adjusted gate electrode, to achieve as precisely possible self-dimensioned doping areas with however relatively large penetration depth, the doping areas are first by means of ion implantation as buried areas (18, 19) in the semiconductor body(10) in the mutual arrangement determined by masking.By subsequent heat treatment, the desired extent of the buried areas thus formed is brought about to reach the semiconductor surface.
