<ABSTRACT>
1.  a shallow quench chamber (30) for a load disconnection switch with pivotably mounted trailing blades (28), the shallow quench chamber comprising a synthetic shallow housing which accommodates a trailing blade contact (24) and consists of a material which gives off a quench gas, and which has a narrow quench chamber extending at least over the range of pivotal movement of the trailing blade, characterised in that the synthetic shallow housing consists of elastically deformable plates (42, 44) which form the sidewalls of the quench chamber and an essentially stiff l-shaped carrier frame (34) which is of substantially u-shaped cross-section, with the support and cover wall side edge regions of these plates (42, 44) being fastened to the inner sides of the limbs of the carrier frame (34) of u-shaped cross-section.
