<ABSTRACT>
in a cartridge (14) for an endless typewriter ribbon (10), a  fresh ribbon is stored in the cartridge (14) with a substantial  length of ribbon (10) wound in a convolute around a roller  (26).  when the cartridge (14) is mounted in a printing  apparatus, the ribbon (10) is drawn from the cartridge (14),  exhausting the convolute.  when the cartridge (14) is fully  mounted in position in the printer, a single path of ribbon  (10) extends into the cartridge (14) and through an opening  (24) along a chord of the roller (26) and out from the cartridge  (14).  a brake (28) is provided to limit motion of the roller (26)  so as to preclude premature unwinding of the convolute and  to limit oscillation of the roller (26) during operation of the  printer.  with the normal operating path of the ribbon (10)  extending through the chord-oriented slot (24) of the roller  (26), ribbon (10) can readily be rewound onto the roller (26)  upon removal of the cartridge (14) from the printer.
