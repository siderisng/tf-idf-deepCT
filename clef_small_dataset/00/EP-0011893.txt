<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a pesticidal composition comprising,  as active ingredients, (a) a pyrethroid insecticide of formula i:    wherein a is an optionally substituted aralkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl  or arylaminoalkyl group, and b is a group of formula    wherein r is hydrogen, cyano or ethynyl, x is alkyl, alkenyl,  aralkyl or aryloxy and n is 1 to 5 or b is a 3, 4, 5, 6-­ tetra-hydrophthalimidomethyl group; and   (b) an α-amino acid derivative of formula iii:    wherein r¹ is an optionally substituted phenyl group or a  methoxy-methyl group, r² is hydrogen or methyl, and r³ is  c₂₋₁₁ alkyl, y is halo, methyl or trifluoromethyl and n¹ is 1 to 5.   further provided is a method of combating pests using the  pesticidal composition.  the composition has been shown to have surprising  activity against dipterous insects.

<DESCRIPTION>
"pesticidal composition and method of combating pests" this invention relates to a pesticidal composition and a method of combating pests. a class of insecticides commonly referred to in the art as "pyrethroid insecticides" is known and various examples of pyrethroid insecticides are described, together with their preparation, in uk patent specification no. 1,413,491 and us patents nos. 3,268,398, 3,835,178 and 3,996,2he. the applicant has found that a composition including certain pyrethroid insecticides and members of a class of amino acid derivatives, some of which are known as herbicides or as fungicides, possess synergistic activity with respect to insects, that is to say the activity of the combination of the two pesticides produces a more-than-additive pesticidal effect. according to the present invention there is provided a pesticidal composition comprising, as active ingredients, (a) a pyrethroid insecticide of formula i: 0 ii a - c - o - b (i) wherein a is an optionally substituted aralkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl or arylaminoalkyl group, and b is a group of formula emi1.1 wherein r is hydrogen, cyano or ethynyl, x is alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl or aryloxy and n is 1 to 5 or b is a 3,4,5,6-tetra- hydropbthalimidomethyl group; and (b) an ot-amino acid derivative of formula iii: emi2.1 wherein r is an optionally substituted phenyl group or a methoxy-methyl group, r2is hydrogen or methyl, r3 is c2-11 alkyl, each y is independently halo, methyl or trifluoro methyl and n is 1 to 5. it should be noted that optical isomers, cis-trans isomers and other kinds of geometric isomers of the compounds of formula i and, where appropriate, of the compounds of formula iii, are within the scope of this invention as well as racemates and mixtures of isomers of one or more of the compounds of formula i or, where appropriate, of the compounds of formula iii. in the compounds of formula i, generally an alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkenyl group represented by a or x preferably contains up to 6 carbon atoms, and an aralkyl or aryloxy group represented by a or x preferably contains up to 12 carbon atoms. when a represents an optionally substituted aralkyl group in formula i and b represents a group of formula ii, preferred compounds are those containing a substituted benzyl group of formula iv: emi2.2 wherein z represents a halogen, preferably chlorine, atom, or a c1-4 alkoxy or haloalkoxy group, e.g. methoxy or difluoromethoxy, and q represents a c16 alkyl group, especially a branched alkyl group such as an isopropyl group. examples of compounds of formula i wherein a is a group of formula iv are those where a is i-isopropyl-4-chlorobenzyl, r is hydrogen or cyano, n is 1, and x is 3-phenoxy, e.g. o(-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-o(-isopropyl- 4-chlorophenyl acetate. when a represents an optionally substituted cycloalkyl group in formula i and b represents a group of formula ii, preferred compounds are those containing a cyclopropyl group of formula v: emi3.1 wherein r and a a are independently cl6 alkyl groups, especially methyl, or halogen, especially chlorine, bromine or
