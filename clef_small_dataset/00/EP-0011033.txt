<ABSTRACT>
the contacts with the two groups of electrodes, even and odd, are usually done through a metallic deposition (22) carried out by jetting, during manufacture, onto two opposite lateral faces, and when the construction thereof is provided by stacking successive capacitor stages (n-1) n+1) separated by finishing layers (20), the metallic deposition opposes, in the finishing phase, easy separation of the stages at the end of manufacture.  the deposition is split up by a mutual shifting (p) of each stage, parallel to the plane of the finishing layers, and the edges of the latter may be provided with projections for hooking onto.  applications in the field of capacitors with plastic dielectric of the "slab" type.  <image>
