<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for applying at predetermined positions  within a predetermined location on a carrier surface predetermined  discrete pieces of indicia which in combination  provide a predetermined indicia presentation particular to the  carrier surface location as part of a scheme of marking like  surface locations with indicia presentations which may vary  from location to location; the apparatus comprising a plurality  of indicia applying sources consisting of a source for each  discrete piece of indicia to be called for by the scheme, means  for feeding the carrier surface past each of the indicia applying  sources so that each predetermined point within the predetermined  location is presented for the application thereto of  indicia from each source, and a control unit for controlling the  indicia applying source in response to input thereto of input  control data for the predetermined surface location defining  the discrete pieces of indicia and position thereof required  therefor, the control unit operating to activate any of the  sources which applies any discrete piece of indicia called for  by the input control data respective such location to effect  application of such indica at any and all positions called for by  such input control data.  the apparatus is especially adapted  for applying colour coded labels and the indicia applying  sources are labelling devices for applying such labels.
