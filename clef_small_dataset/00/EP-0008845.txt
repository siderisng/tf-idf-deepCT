<ABSTRACT>
inclusion of an effective amount of substantially anhydr­ ous acetic acid in a zinc oxide cured liquid poysulfide polymer  based composition results in a cured composition which is  suitable for extrusion under heat and pressure and which on  cooling reverts to a rubbery solid with essentially unchanged  physical properties.  the compositions are useful for the man­ ufacutre of sealants and extrudible goods such as hoses.
