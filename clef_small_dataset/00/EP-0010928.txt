<ABSTRACT>
a take-up spool which comprises two identical com­ ponents having respective elongate portions (11, 11a)  which cooperate in side-by-side parallel relationship to  form the core of the spool, the two components carrying  two pairs of interengaging locking parts (13, 14) at the op­ posite ends of the elongate core portions (11, 11a), which  locking parts (13, 14) are released by a relative unlocking  movement of the two components which simultaneously  brings about a relative bodily movement of the two elonga­ te portions (11, 11a), which results in a reduction in the  cross-sectional size of the core.
