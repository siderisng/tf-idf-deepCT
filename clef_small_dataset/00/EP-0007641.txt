<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a process for preparing  vinyl dispersion resins by conducting the polymerization  reaction of the vinyl monomer or monomers in an aqueous  alkaline medium, using an oil-soluble polymerization  initiator, at temperatures preferably below about 48°c, in the  presence of an emulsifier system comprising the ammonium  salt of a high fatty acid containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms,  at least one long straight chain alcohol containing from 14 to  24 carbon atoms, and a sulfate or sulfonate type soap of c₁₂ to  c₂₀ alkyl or aryl hydrocarbons, wherein the ratio of alcohol to  emulsifier is equal to or greater than 1. 0 and wherein the  reaction ingredients are thoroughly mixed, and preferably  homogenized, prior to polymerization.  the process produces  paste reins having improved plastisol foam properties, espe­ cially when sodium metabisulfite is added to the polymer  recipe or the polymer slurry prior to spray drying.  further,  polymer buildup in the reactor is substantially reduced and  multiple polymerizations can be run in the reactor without  opening the same.
