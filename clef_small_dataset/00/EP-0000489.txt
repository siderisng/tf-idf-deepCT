<ABSTRACT>
In the method of non-destructive testing of semiconductor substrates they are immersed in a dilute electrolytic solution (23), then the substrates (21) are a predetermined time relative to the electrolyte solution (23) with a voltage in the range between about 50 and about 65 volts are biased and negatively biased andAt the same time, the substrate surfaces are illuminated with illuminance in the range between about 538 and about 807 1x.The hydrogen bubble pattern developing at the fault places can be registered photographically.The method is particularly suitable for finding and registering electrically active impurity sites on semiconductor surfaces, defective P / N transitions and disturbed areas in large-area P / N transitions and is therefore as a test method in both semiconductor platelet production and in the manufacture of integratedCircuits can be used.
