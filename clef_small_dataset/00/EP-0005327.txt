<ABSTRACT>
a screw compressor plant has an electric motor for  driving the compressor through a gear train.  the gear  train includes two parallel shafts connected respectively  to the male and female rotors of the compressor.  each  shaft includes a clutch (58, 59) and a gear (56, 57).  the  gears mesh and also mesh with a third gear (55) fixed  to the output shaft of the motor.  control means are provided  for operating the clutches to selectively connect the motor  to either the male or female rotor and the gear ratios are  selected so that two operating conditions are thereby  provided for the compressor, a full speed condition and a  part speed condition.  the control means is responsive to  pressure signals from a sensor positioned in the output line  of a receiver to which compressed gas from the compressor  is delieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in positive displacement compressors the invention relates to positive displacement compressors and is particularly though not exclusively concerned with screw compressors. it is clearly established that the ability to reduce the part load power consumption of compressor plants, particularly screw compressor plants, is of major advantage. a number of systems have been proposed for this purpose, including a suction regulator for continuous modulation flow control, a full slide-valve arrangement and a system for infinitely variable speed control. however, each of these systems has disadvantages and the present invention seeks to overcome these disadvantages. in particular, the present invention seeks to provide a system with a high level of efficiency over the whole range of system demand and prticularly between 30% and 100% of maximum demand and to achieve this with a lesser number of components (and therefore at less cost) than has hitherto been the case. the invention provides a positive displacement compressor comprising at least one compressing element rotatable or reciprocable in a housing having an inlet for fluid to be compressed and an outlet for compressed fluid, a power source, a gear train for connecting the power source to the compressing element to drive the element, said gear train including means for connecting the power source to the compressing element for driving the element in two discrete speed conditions, a full speed condition and a part spped condition, and control means for operating the gear train to switch the compressing element from one speed condition to the other in response to pressure signals from the output side of the compressor. preferably the compressor is a screw compressor in which the compressing element is a male rotor which meshes with a female rotor. preferably the gear train includes a first shaft connected to the male rotor for driving said rotor and a second shaft connected to the female rotor for driving the male rotor through the female rotor, the connecting means being operable to connect the powertsource to either the first shaft or the second shaft. the connecting means may comprise a first clutch for the first shaft and a second clutch for the second shaft. the gear train may include a plurality of meshing parallel-shaft gears, a first gear fixed on an output shaft of the power source, a second gear connected to the first clutch and a third gear connected to the second clutch. the power source is preferably an electric motor, and the control means is preferably operable also to switch the motor on and off. in a second embodiment, the gear train includes an output shaft connected to the male rotor, at least two meshing parallel-shaft gears and clutch means for connecting each of the gears to the output shaft. the compressor described above is preferably part of a plant further comprising a receiver for compressed gas, means connecting the compressor outlet r to the receiver, an outlet from the receiver and a non-return valve in the receiver outlet, the pressure signals for the
