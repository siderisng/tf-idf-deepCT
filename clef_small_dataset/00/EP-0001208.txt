<ABSTRACT>
switch wherein fixed contacts (q₁ - q₄), formed by bending  conductive long plate members, are disposed at the top and  the bottom positions of the pole chambers (3), so as to provide  the stardelta connection.  the movable bridging contacts (p₁ -  p₄) are provided with plate springs (5) on their backs.  this  plate springs (5) are pressed by cross bars (17, 18) to curve  according to the tilting manipulation of the lever (6) to shift the  movable contact in right or left directions to operate.  the  manipulation lever is provided with an erroneous manipulation  preventing mechanism.  this mechanism is composed of  fixed concave portions on the top of the bearings and a control  plate with concaves portions the latter is slidably moved by  the lever (6) between the bearings.  a key shaft is made  engageable with the bearings and the concave portions of the  control plate to holt the star-neutral- and delta-position.
