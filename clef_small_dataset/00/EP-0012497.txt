<ABSTRACT>
a problem arises when simultaneous attempts are  made to write and read from the same location in a random  access memory.  the invention deals with this problem by  delaying the writing operations automatically by a varying  amount to prevent attempts at simultaneous writing and  reading: and preferably to position each write operation  approximately mid-way between two read operations.  the invention is particularly applicable to a television  synchroniser.  in a television synchroniser video information  is digitised and then fed into a memory by write clock sig­ nals derived from the video information, e. g.  from its line  synchronising pulses.  it is fed out of the memory by read  clock signals derived from some other source.  the invention is also applicable to standards conver­ sion systems, noise reduction systems and picture size  reduction and expansion systems.
