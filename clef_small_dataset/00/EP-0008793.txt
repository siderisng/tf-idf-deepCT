<ABSTRACT>
1.  shaft consisting of shaft rods (2, 3) formed by u-shaped plastic profiles (3a), which each carry firmly glued between the free ends of the members (12, 14) a metal profile rail (15) provided with an anchorage stud, characterized in that the anchorage stud (42) of the metal profile rail (15) has on its sides connected to the insides of the members (12, 14) of the plastic profile (3a) constrictions (43, 44) extending along the length of the metal profile rail (15), which co-operate with congruent cams (40, 41) on the insides of the members (12, 14) of the plastic profile (3a), whilst the outer circumference of the projecting cams (40, 41) is smaller than the space of the constriction (43, 44), so that there exists between the cams (40, 41) and the constrictions a space serving to accommodate adhesive, which is closed upwards and downwards by the members (12, 14) of the u-shaped plastic profile (3a) abutting the stud (42).
