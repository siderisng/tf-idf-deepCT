<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the conversion of fuel (solid  and/or liquid) to reducing and/or synthesis gas by contacting  the fuel in a fluidized conversion bed (13) with a solid oxygen  donor (e. g.  caso₄) at a fuel conversion temperature (e. g.  850  to 1150°c) in the presence of at least one gas/vapour phase  substance such as h₂ and/or h₂o and/or co and/or co₂  which serves to promote and or mediate the transfer of  oxygen from the donor to the fuel and preferably in the  absence of non-reactive gases (e. g.  n₂) whereby the fuel is  converted to a reducing and-or synthesis gas product by  (inter alia) partial oxidation employing the oxygen of the solid  oxygen donor, the latter being reduced (e. g.  cas).  the  reduced donor is exothermically oxidized in a fluidized oxida­ tion bed (35) by contact with an oxygen-containing gas (e. g.   air) and re-used for converting further quantities of fuel.   moieties (e. g.  sulfur/sulfur compounds) whose presence is  undesirable in the gas product may be removed by a solid  moiety-fixing agent (e. g.  cao) in the conversion bed (13).  the  moiety-fixing properties of the latter are at least partly regen­ erated in a fluidized regenerator bed (48) by treatment in a  suitable regenerating atmosphere, and the regenerated  moiety-fixing agent is returned to the conversion bed (13)  directly and/or indirectly via the oxidation bed (35).
