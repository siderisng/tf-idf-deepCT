<ABSTRACT>
change of distance measuring apparatus features a  light transmitter-receiver unit 23 which is used to sense the  distance a to the surface of a measurement object 35 and  more particularly to sense changes in the distance a occur­ ring due to changes in thickness of the measurement object  35 as it moves against a guide surface in the direction of the  arrow f.  the optical system features a front objective 14  which focusses a parallel beam of light received from a laser  light source via beam widening optics 13′, 13″, a modal  aperture 12 for limiting the beam to the zero order defrac­ tion image of the laser light source and a beam dividing  mirror 33.  light returned from the surface of the measure­ ment object whether specularly reflected or scattered is  gathered by the front objective 14 and is passed to a photo­ electric converter 19 via the dividing mirror 33, a further  objective 16 and a second modal aperture stop 18.  the  signal at the photoelectric converter 19 is a maximum when  the surface of the measurement object 35 is located in the  desired plane 15.  the position of the desired plane can be  adjusted by optical means such as moving the front lens 14  and the extent of the movement required to maximize the  signal at the photoelectric converter 19 is indicative of the  change in the distance a.  various useful modifications are  disclosed including the use of a comparison beam 36.
