<ABSTRACT>
a sealing device is used to form a lining on the inner  surfaces of the joint portions of two adjacent pipes.  the  sealing device includes an elastic sleeve (22) having end  sections (23, 23) and an intermediate section (24) between  the end sections.  a ring-like, elastic foamed band (30) is  wrapped around the outer peripheral surface of the end  sections of the sleeve.  when the foamed band (30) is  pressed by an expanding ring (26) against the inner surfa­ ce of the pipes, an exudable binder is squeezed out of the  foamed band (30) to permit the end sections of the sleeve  to be bonded to the inner surface of the pipes.  the inter­ mediate section (24) of the sleeve (22) is thinner in its wall  than the wall of the end sections of the sleeve to permit an  axial expansion of the sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
sealing device for a pipe joint this invention relates to a sealing device for forming a lining on the inner surfaces of the joint portions of two adjacent large-diameter pipes to prevent leakage at the joint sections of the pipes through which a fluid such as a gas and water flows. a sealing device of this kind is already known in british patent no. 1,200,225 where a tubular sleeve is mounted on the inner surfaces -of the joint portions of two adjacent pipes. ring-like projections are provided on the outer peripheral surfaces of the end sections of the sleeve and pressed against the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes by radially outwardly expanding ring members which are fitted in the inner surfaces of the sleeve. as a result, a certain extent of sealing is assured. however, the sealing device of this patent is not satisfactory under the following situations. where a great earthquake occurs, there is a possibility that the pipes will be axially relatively displaced at their joint portions, or bent, with the resultant opening at the joint portions of the pipes. under these situations, there is a risk that leakage of a gas flowing through the pipe will occur. pipes or ducts embedded in the ground suffer an inadvertent displacement during passage of a longer period due in part to the movement of the ground and the joint portions of the adjacent two pipes become slackened, involving a possible leakage of gas at the joint portions of the pipes. under these situations, the sleeve is likely to be slipped out of the pipe along the inner surface of the pipe, causing gas leakage at the joint portions of the pipes. it is accordingly an object of this invention to provide a sealing device for a pipe joint which can prevent leakage of a fluid such as a gas in a pipe even if two adjacent pipes are displaced apart from each other at their joint portions. in order to attain this object, a ring-like elastic foamed body impregnated with an exudable or liquid flowable binder is wrapped around the outer peripheral surface of the end setions of an elastic sleeve of the sealing device according to this invention. when the end sections of the sleeve are pressed against the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes by radially expanding respective expansion rings, the elastic foamed body is pressed, causing the binder in the elastic foamed body to be squeezed out to permit the end sections of the sleeve to be bonded to the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes. the intermediate section between the end sections of the sleeve is expansible in the axial direction of the sleeve even if the joint portions of the pipes are displaced away from each other, the end sections of the sleeve remain fixed to the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes be cause of the expansion of the intermediate section

claims:    1. a sealing device for forming a lining on the joint portions (17) of pipes (15, 16), comprising a tubular sleeve (22) made of an elastic material and having end sections (23, 23) and an intermediate section (24) between the end sections, said end sections of the sleeve being adapted to be brought into contact with the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes, and expanding means (26) fitted in the corresponding inner surfaces of the end sections of the sleeve to cause the outer peripheral surfaces of the end sections of the sleeve to be contacted with the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes, characterized in that a elastic foamed body (30) impregnated with an exudable binder is wrapped around the outer peripheral surfaces of the end sections (23,  23) of the sleeve (22) and that when the foamed body is pressed by the expanding means (26) against the inner surface of the joint portions (17) of the pipes (15, 16) the binder is squeezed out of the foamed body to permit the end sections of the sleeve to be bonded to the inner surfaces of the joint portions of the pipes.    2. a sealing device according to claim 1, in which a groove (31) for receiving the elastic foamed body (30) is defined by a pair of flange-like projections or ridges (28, 29) which are integrally formed on the outer peripheral surface of the end sections (23, 23) of the sleeve (22).    3. a sealing device according to claim 1, in which said intermediate section (24) of said sleeve (22) is expansible in the axial direction of the sleeve.    4. a sealing device according to claim 3, in which a strengthening insert piece (54) is embedded in respective end section (23, 23) of said sleeve.    5. a sealing device according to claim 3, in which said intermediate section (24) of said sleeve (22) is  thinner than said end sections (23, 23) of said sleeve.    6. a sealing device according to claim 3, in which said intermediate section (24) of the sleeve (22) is softer in its property than said end sections (23, 23) of said sleeve (22).    7. a sealing device according to claim 1, in which a plurality of mutually spaced-apart ring-like projections or ridges (50, 51, 52, 53) are integrally formed on the outer peripheral surface of the end sections (23, 23) of the sleeve (22) and said elastic foamed body (30) is wrapped around some (53) of the ring-like projections.     8. a sealing device according to claim 7, in which those ring-like projections (50, 51, 52) not covered by said elastic foamed body (30) are arranged toward the intermediate section (24) of the sleeve (22) in an increasing order of height.    9. a sealing device according to claim   1    or 3, in which an expansion preventing ring member (60) is wrapped around the outer peripheral surface of the intermediate section (24) of the sleeve (22) to prevent the intermediate section of the sleeve from being radially expanded by an internal pressure of the pipe.    10. a sealing device according to claim 9, in which said expansion preventing ring member (60) is covered with a coating material (61) which provides no substantial adherence to the intermediate section (24) of the sleeve (22) by a binder impregnated in an elastic foamed body (30).
