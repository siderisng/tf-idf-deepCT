<ABSTRACT>
a dual path moving walkway has recirculating pallets  or treadplates which are releasably latched at their outer  sides during movement in the passenger-carrying areas beÂ­ tween the ends of the walkway.  at the ends, the latches  are released.  the latch means has, on one pallet, a pair of  pivotal arms (13) which carry a wheeled axle (15) and on  the adjacent pallet a recess (8) to engage the axle (15).  in the passenger-carrying area a transport rail (12)  retains the axle (15) in said recess (8); at the end of the  carrying area the rail (12) terminates and the axle (15)  drops out of engagement, thus releasing the outer side of  adjacent pallets.
