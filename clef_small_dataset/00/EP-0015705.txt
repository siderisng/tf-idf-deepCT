<ABSTRACT>
the upper section (2) of a telescopic steering column (1)  has an outer tube (2a) and an inner rotatable shaft (2b) and  can slide over a splined lower section (3) (arrow a) and can  pivot back and forth (arrow b) about a lateral axis (6).  the up足 per section (2) extends through a slider (13) of a clamp (7) so  that pivoting of the upper section (2) makes the slider (13)  slide relative to a fixed plate (9) in a direction (arrow c) deter足 mined by guide means (16, 17).  rotation of a control knob (8)  extending through the fixed plate (9) causes a clamping block  (15) to trap the slider (13) immovably against the fixed plate  (9), preventing said pivoting of the upper section (2).  at the  same time a portion (30) on the block (15) straightens at least  one bent spring (24) which then pushes a pad (20) against the  outer tube (2a) of the upper section (2) to trap the outer tube  (2a) against a part (23) of the slidable plate (13) to prevent said  relative sliding movement of the steering column sections.  sui足 table adjusting means (25 to 28) are preferably provided to en足 sure the upper section (2) is clamped against said pivoting and  sliding movements simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
"vehicle steering apparatus11 this invention relates to vehicle steering apparatus including a steering column which can be adjusted relative to its mounting in the vehicle and be clamped in a particular orientation relative to its mounting in order, for example, to suit different operators. it is known to provide vehicle steering apparatus comprising a steering column which has a lower part , which is adapted to be mounted in a manner which permits pivotal movement of the steering column about an axis extending laterally of the longitudinal axis of said steering column, an upper part which has a sliding connection with the lower part and includes relatively rotatable members of which one can be clamped in position without affecting the steering action of the column, and means for clamping the said one member. it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an easily operated clamp which can inhibit simultaneously pivotal movement of the steering column and the relative sliding movement of the said parts of the steering column sections and thereby, in effect, adjustably fix the height and rake of the steering wheel. for this purpose the clamping means includes a fixture extending substantially laterally of the steering column, a slider which is capable of movement along the fixture, is connected to the said one member and carries a pressure pad disposed to bear against the said one member, an operating device which operates a clamp to fix the slider relative to the fixture, a spring strip which is located on the slider and provides force for the pressure pad, the spring strip being stressed by engagement with part of the said clamp. reference is now made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, one embodiment of the invention, and of which: figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view including a part vertical section of a vehicle steering apparatus according to the invention showing the clamping device in position to clamp the steering column about pivotal and up and down sliding movement; figure 2 is a view, of the clamp plate and other movable parts of the apparatus of figure 1, viewed from above on an enlarged scale; and figure 3 is a sectional view on line iii-iii of figure 1. a steering column 1 comprises an upper part 2 which carries at its upper end a steering wheel or like device (not visible), and a lower part 3 which is inserted into the lower end of the upper part 2. the upper part 2 is constituted by an outer tubular member 2a which surrounds an inner shaft 2b; the steering wheel is mounted on the upper end of the shaft 2b. the inner shaft 2b is mounted in the outer it#rriber 2a in any suitable manner so that it can rotate freely with respect to the outer member 2a, but cannot move longitudinally with respect thereto. the lower end of the inner shaft 2b and the upper end of the lower part 3 are

claims:    1. vehicle steering apparatus including a steering column comprising a lower part, which is adapted to be mounted in a manner which permits pivotal movement of the steering column about an axis extending laterally of the longitudinal axis of said steering column, an upper part which has a sliding connection with the lower part and includes relatively rotatable members of which one can be clamped in position without affecting the steering action of the column, and means for clamping the said one member, characterised in that the means for clamping comprises a fixture (9) extending substantially laterally of the steering column (1), a slider (13) which is capable of movement along the fixture (9), is connected to the said one member (2a) and carries a pressure pad (20) disposed to bear against the said one member,  an operating device (8) which operates a clamp (14,15) to fix the slider (13) relative to the fixture, a spring strip (24) which is located on the slider and provides force for the pressure pad, the spring strip being stressed by engagement with part (15) of the said clamp.    2. vehicle steering apparatus according to claim 1 in which guide means (16,17) are provided for constraining movement of said slider (13) relative to said fixture (9) to movement back and forth in said one direction.    3. vehicle steering apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which said clamp includes a block (15) which is movable towards said fixture (9) so as to trap the slider (13) between the block and the fixture.       4. vehicle steering apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3, in which the slider has an aperture (18) in which the steering column's upper part (2) is accommodated for longitudinal sliding movement relative to said slider.    5. vehicle steering apparatus according to claim 4 in which the pressure pad (20) is loosely mounted in said slider and is arranged to trap the said one member (2a) of the steering column in said aperture.    6. vehicle steering apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 5, in which the strip (24) has a bend located intermediate its ends, and in which the bend is engaged by the clamp's part (15) such that the strip is straightened and increases the force exerted by the pad (20).    7. vehicle steering apparatus as claimed in claim 6 in which means are provided for adjusting the position of said strip relative to said slider.
