<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to the reduction of polymer buildup  on the inner surfaces of a polymerization reactor by applying a  polymer buildup resistant coating material to the inner sur­ faces thereof, the method or process of applying said coating  being the subject of this invention.  an approximate mono­ layer coating on the inner surfaces of the reactor results from  applying thereto an aqueous or organic solvent solution of the  coating material by means of steam, and preferably, superhe­ ated steam, said coating material being an organic compound  or polymer which is capable of resisting polymer buildup  thereon.  as examples of such materials there may be named  the polyaromatic amines, self-condensed polyhydric phenols,  tannic acid and tannates, various dyes such as nigrosine, and  the like, etc.  when using steam to apply the coating material,  the same reaches the reactor surfaces in the form of a melted  mist.  when polymerizing olefinic monomers, such as vinyl  halides, vinylidene halides, and vinylidene monomers having  at least one terminal ch₂ =c< grouping, and mixtures  thereof, in the presence of said coating, polymer buildup on  the inner surfaces of the reaction vessel is substantially elimi­ nated.
