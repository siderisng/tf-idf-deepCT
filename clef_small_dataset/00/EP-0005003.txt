<ABSTRACT>
an expandable abrading tool (20) includes a rotatable  arbor or shaft (22) and an abrasive insert (24) having stacked  washers (26) which are mounted on the shaft (22) in a  clamped relationship.  each washer (26) has a round outer  edge with abrasive (32) thereon for performing a cutting  operation on tool rotation.  each washer (26) is frustoconical  and points towards one end of the insert (24).  a threaded  clamp (38, 40, 42, 44) for clamping the ends (34, 36) of the  insert (24) is adjustable to increase the clamping force so as  to flatten the washers (26) and control their diameters.  the  insert (24) can thus be initially sized for use and can be later  adjusted to compensate for wear.
