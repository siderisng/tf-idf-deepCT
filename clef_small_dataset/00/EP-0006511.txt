<ABSTRACT>
In a pipe cleaning apparatus of a probe (11) insertable in a pipe is assigned a roller set of at least two rollers (24, 38), which are retractable to each other relative to the probe (11) and are reversible to the probe (11) in the Slide the pipe in or withdraw from the pipe. The probe is an elongated structure of constant cross section, z. b. A coil spring-like helix, a hose or a rigid lance, and at its end a tool suitable for cleaning the pipe, z. b. a nozzle head, drill or the like. The rollers (24, 38) are mounted on a roller carrier (18), which in turn is pivotable on a frame (12) about an axis (16), which is at least approximately at right angles to the between the rollers (24, 38) led Probe (11) extends. The additional propulsion is an eccentric or crank operation, which is driven by a roller drive motor (21) driven by a roller drive motor (21) and swings the roller carrier (18) around the axis (16). As a result, the probe (11) are given periodic longitudinal movements which superimpose their feed or retreat movement generated by deselection of the rollers (24, 38).
