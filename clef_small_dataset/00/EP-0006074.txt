<ABSTRACT>
In a device and a method of calibrating and for directing pipe pieces (5), a calibration unit (1) provided with calibration jaws (3) is used, to which in the vertical plane on rockers pivotable and driven in the horizontal plane conveying rollers (30) on both sides be connected. When inserting the feed movement for the portion of a pipe section (5) into the calibration unit (1), the vertical movement of the rockers (38) is blocked until the calibration jaws (3) in its closing movement almost touch the pipe section to be calibrated. At the latest with the touch of the pipe section through the baking (3), the blocking of the rocker motion is canceled and the acceleration of the locking movement of the baking (3) is reduced in the calibration phase. After completion calibration process before the calibration jaws (3) are reopened, the rocker movement of the rollers (30) is blocked again. To influence the rocker movement, brakes (44) are present, which are attracted when inserting the feed movement of the conveyor rollers (30). They are releasable with the help of sensors (26) coupled to the calibration jaws (3), wherein additionally the sensors (26) are in effect with the drive of the calibration jaws for opening and closing thereof.
