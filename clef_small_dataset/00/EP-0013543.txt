<ABSTRACT>
modular prefrabricated semi-panels to build inside or  bearing walls by means of auxiliary connecting spacers,  wherein said semi-panels are used in couples in a specular  disposition of same.  the two semi-panels (111,112) of each  couple are connected to each other by means of suitable pairs  of connecting spacers 114,114′ which are inserted in approp­ riate openings (113′) of the specular semi-panels, one spacer  (114) of each pair being rectilinear to define the desired dis­ tance between the semi-panels while the other (114′) has its  ends bent at 90° in order that said distance between the so  connected two semi-panels may be really secured.
