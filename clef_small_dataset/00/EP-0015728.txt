<ABSTRACT>
a cryostat comprises a vacuum jacket (12) defining a re­ servoir for cryogenic liquid (15) e. g.  liquid helium.  an access  passage (24) extends across the vacuum jacket (12) and is  provided with two separate and distinct heat stations (65, 67)  which are thermally coupled to respective stages (42, 43) of a  multi-stage cryogenic refrigerator (40).  the cryostat also in­ cludes two thermally conductive radiation shields (60, 62)  which are disposed in the vacuum space of the vacuum jacket  (12) and are also thermally coupled to the stages (42, 43) of the  cryogenic refrigerator (40).  means (70, 80) are also described  to enable the cryogenic refrigerator (40) to be removed from  the cryostat without exposing the cryogenic liquid (15) to the  atmosphere.
