<ABSTRACT>
a compartmental syringe having an outer casing (1)  open at one end and provided with a normally closed outlet  (19) at the opposite end, a cylinder (6) reciprocable within the  casing in which latter works a plunger; the cylinder being  spaced from the inner periphery of the casing to form an  outer chamber (13) and the space within the cylinder forming  an inner chamber (14) for containing materials to be mixed to  form a composition for injection.  a nozzle (12) on the  cylinder extends through a sealing gland (17) and can be  withdrawn therefrom to communicate the outer chamber  with the inner chamber so that reciprocation of the plunger  mixes the materials.  the outlet (19) is opened after mixing  and attached to a needle for injection.
