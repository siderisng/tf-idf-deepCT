<ABSTRACT>
In the adaptive delta modulator of a speech transmission system, a digital companing (12) is provided for reducing the flank overload distortion (slope overload distortion) in rapid amplitude changes of the analogous voice signal (2) to be modulated and reducing quantization noise, which adapted to the course of the analog input amplitude Generates modulation step sizes Î±i resulting from non-linear polynomial formation using digital comparators (22, 18) and multiple arithmetic units (24,26, 30). Here, the step size is slightly reduced when two consecutive modulation bits of the bits sequence emitted by the modulator do not have the same logical state. The step size is slightly increased when two consecutive bits are equal, and it is greatly increased when three or more consecutive bits are the same. Further, a circuit (MC) is provided for generating a minimum step size in the case of the absence of an input signal. The signal generated by the compander is guided via a digital integrator (14) and a D / A converter (41) and then compared with the analog input signal (2) in a comparator (4). The fully digitally constructed modulator enables the operation of a plurality of input lines in time-multiplex operation. For this purpose, the compander (12) and the integrator (14) contain suitable memory (36, 38) for temporary storage of intermediate values.
