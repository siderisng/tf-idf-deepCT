<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for obtaining ge solved, suspended or chemically bonded substances, e.g.b.Uranous or other metal compounds, from a substantially horizontal flow (133) in widths, waters, from which water is directed in a substance into the vertical deflected current by a fluidized bed of the substances binding adsorber particles.In this case, the water to be conductive through the bed is guided at least prior to the deflection in the vertical for increasing the static pressure by a DIF fusor (130a-D).If necessary, little stens may be the low-powered partial layer of the water boundary layer, which occurs before reaching the diffuser (130b-d) under the flow of surface friction, by means of a discharge channel (150) from entry into the opening (134) of the diffuser (130b-d) be held.
