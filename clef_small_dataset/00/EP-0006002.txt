<ABSTRACT>
a method of fabricating a field effect transistor comprising  the steps of forming an active layer (5) of semiconductor  material (gaas) over a surface of a first substrate (2) of  semiconductor material (gaas), applying a second substrate  (6) of insulating material, eg glass, over the surface of the  active layer, removing the first substrate so that the active  layer is now supported on the insulating second substrate,  and forming source, drain (9, 10) and gate (12) electrodes  over the free surface of the active layer.  to facilitate removal  of the gaas first substrate by selective etching, a buffer layer  (1) of gaa1as resistant to the gaas etchant, may be formed  between the active layer and the first substrate, which buffer  layer is removed, following removal of first substrate, using  a selective etchant to which the gaas active layer is resistant.   the technique is particularly applicable to high frequency  fets requiring a very thin active channel region interfaced to  a substrate having good insulating properties.
