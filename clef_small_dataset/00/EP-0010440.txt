<ABSTRACT>
asymmetrically substituted pyromellitic diimides of for­ mula:    in which r₁ and r₂ are not the same and each represents  hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, lower alkanoyl,  benzoyl, di(lower alkyl)amino, lower alkanoylamino, ben­ zoylamino, lower alkoxycarbonylamino or certain substituted  phenyl or substituted lower alkyl radicals and each of x and y  is hydrogen, halogen or lower alkyl, are novel compounds  that are obtainable by treating pyromellitic dianhydride with  two appropriately substituted amines or with ammonia and  one amine.  the compounds can be administered to ruminant ani­ mals to increase their feed efficiency and suitable composi­ tions for this purpose include the compounds with an inert  carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
pyromellitic i)iimides, their production and use the present invention is based on the discovery of certain novel substituted pyromellitic diimides, in which the two imide nitrogen atoms are asymmetrically substituted, and the discovery that such compounds can be administered to ruminant animals in order to increase feed efficiency, to shift the production of volatile fatty acids away from acetate with an increase in propionate and butyrate, and to suppress methane formation. the novel asymetrically substituted pyromellitic diimides of this invention have the following structural formula: emi1.1 in which r1 and r2 are not the same and each represents hydrogen, all, alkenyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, lower alkanoyl, benzoyl, di(lower alkyl)amino, lower alkanoylamino, benzoylamino, lower alkoxycarbonylamino, substituted phenyl having a sulfonamido, hydroxy, carboxy, nitro, methylthio, or lower hydroxyalkyl substituent; or substituted lower alkyl having one or two hydroxy, halogen, nitro, lower alkoxy, carboxy, phenol, lower hydroxy- alkoxy, lower alkanoyloxy, phenoxy, amino, lower alkylamino, di(lower alkrl)amino, mercapto, lower alkylthio, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, lower hydroxyalkylthio, lower hydroxyalkylsulfinyl, lower hydroxysulfonyl, lower hydroxyalkylamino, di(lower hydro xyalkyl) amino, lower alkanoyl amino or hydroxyphenyl substituent an each ofx and y, independently of the other, is hydroxy, lower alkyl or halogen. in the present specification: the term "loweralkyl'1 means alkyl containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in either a straight or branched configuration, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl. the term "lower alkenyl" means alkenyl containing a single unsaturation in a straight or branched chain length of from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl or hexenyl. the term "lower alkynyl" means alkyl containing one triple bond in a straight or branched chain of from 2-6 carbon atoms, e.g. ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl or hexvnyl. the term "cycloalkyl" means c6 cycloalkyl groups, viz. cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. the term "lower alkanoyl" means aikanoyl of straight or branched configuration containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, pentanoyl and hexanoyl. the term "lower alkanoyloxy" means the foregoing lower alkanoyl groups bonded to the lower alkyl pyromellitic diimide substrate through an oxygen atom. the term "lower alkoxy" means alkoxy containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in either a straight or branched configuration, e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, jbutoxy, tert tert-butoxy, pentoxy or hexoxy. the term "lower alkoxycarbonyl" means the foregoing lower alkoxy groups bonded to the pyromellitic diimide substrate through a carbonyl group. the preferred compounds of this invention are those in which, in the formula, r1 and r2 are not the same and each is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkanoyl, di(loweralkyl)amino, benzoylamino or substituted lower alkyl having one or two hydroxy, amino, alkylamino, di(loweralkyl)amino, lower alkoxy, carboy, carbamoyl, phenyl, lower hydroxyalkoxy, lower hydroxyalkylthio, lower alkanoyloxy, mercapto, lower alkylthio, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl substituents; and x and y are both hydrogen. especially preferred compounds are those in which r and r2 are not the same and each is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkanoyl, di(lower alkyl)amino or substituted
