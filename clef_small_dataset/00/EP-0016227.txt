<ABSTRACT>
an optical device which is used to take, project or enlarge  a wide screen system picture.  an object of the present invention  is to provide an optical device which is small in size and  light in weight, and simple in its assembling.  there are provided  optical plastic cylindrical lens systems (1), (2) which are  composed of front lens group of focal length fa and rear lens  group of focal lengths fb in front of a master lens (3) of focal  length fm so as to satisfy the relationship of formula   ₄ f m ≧ | fb | ≧ ₂ f m   thus, it is possible that the rear lens group (2) and the master  lens (3) are located in close proximity to each other and have  substantially the same diameter.  further, projections (9), (10),  (14), (16) and recesses (8), (20), (21), (15) are formed at the  frame formed integrally with the cylindrical lens systems and  at the edge of a lens barrel (17), whereby, the buses of the  cylindrical lens systems (1), (2) are determined by fitting the  projections to the associated recesses.
