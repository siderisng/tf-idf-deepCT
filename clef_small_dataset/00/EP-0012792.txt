<ABSTRACT>
In a digital power amplifier with Josephson contacts, several contacts switchable from the de-energized contacts via resistors (R₁, R₂) are connected parallel to each other and to a load circuit (5). The first contact (J1) switches the current (Ib) and the input signal (IIN) as a result of which the current (IIn) in its stress state. As a result of the derived current and the current shock generated by the derivation of an inductance (L₁), a subsequent contact (J2) switches to the voltage state. As a result, the sum of the current and the current fault is supplied to the load circuit. Several equal stages of the circuit may act in cascade and parallel to a common load. The Josephson contacts can reset themselves. The superconducting circuit, which requires only a single power supply source (3), can produce particularly short duration and high amplitude with high film in the load pulses.
