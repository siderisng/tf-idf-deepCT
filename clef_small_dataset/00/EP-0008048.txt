<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to electrical articles having an  electrical coil such as high-tension transformers, igni­ tion and the like which are excellent in withstand voltage  and endurance; and to a method for manufacturing the  same.  these electrical articles having an electrical coil in  which a sheet material such as paper, cloth or non-woven  fabric comprising cellulose as major constituent is used  as at least a part of interlayer insulator.  said sheet mate­ rial is characterized by being impregnated with one or more  pretreating resins selected from the group consisting of  phenolic resins, s-triazine ring compound resins, and phen­ ol-s-triazine ring compound co-condensation resins and  further impregnated with a thermosetting resin compo­ sition containing an epoxy resin, unsaturated polyester  resin, 1,2-polybutadiene resin or silicone resin, said resin  being hardened.  the electrical articles of this invention  are useful as high-tension transformers, ignition coils for  internal combustion engines, ignition coils for gas- and  petroleum-burners, electromagnetic valves, and solenoides,  particularly as resin-molded coils encapsulated with resins  and above all as resin-molded ignition coils for automo­ bile engines.  thus, this invention provides electrical artic­ les having an electrical coil excellent in withstand voltage,  endurance, corona resistance and moisture resistance and  also provides an advantageous method for manufacturing  such articles.
