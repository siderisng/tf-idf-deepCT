<ABSTRACT>
a modelling compound which can be made from a  modelling powder which comprises a mixture of grain flour,  sodium chloride or the like, organic food acid and edible oil.   the proportions of the ingredients are such that the mixture  is in dry powdery form which therefore is easily handled and  can be stored for long periods without deterioration and,  further, such that when water and heat is added to the  modelling powder, to gelatinize the flour, the acidity of the  resulting compound is in the range 2 ph to 5 ph.
