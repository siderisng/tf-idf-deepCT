<ABSTRACT>
vaccines derived from avian reo virus to combat abera­ tions of the skeleton such as rachitis-like symptoms,  osteoperose c. q.  femur degeneration, diarrhoea and growth  inhibition, a process for their preparation, combined, inacti­ vated vaccines, ready for administration and active against at  least newcastle disease and disease symptomes caused by  reo virus and process for the preparation of such vaccine, are  disclosed.  the combined vaccine is prepared by addition of a newcas­ tie disease virus (ndvl) containing liquid, obtained by cultiva­ tion of a ndv, followed by inactivation of this liquid and  optionally homogenizing it, together with a reo virus-­ containing liquid, obtained by cultivation of a rea virus, fol­ lowed by inactivation of this liquid and optionally homogeniz­ ing it, to an oily phase containing as essential components at  least one of the components selected from the group consist­ ing of light paraffinic mineral oils, plant oils and pafthenic  mineral oils and one or more emulsifiers, such as non-ionic  surface-active compound derived from alkylene oxide and/or  hexahydric alcohols and/or higher natural fatty acids such as  esters or ester-ethers, optionally followed by homogenizing  and/or addition of a preservative.  also a reo virus strain lz 671, deposited with the collec­ tion d'institut pasteur, paris under no.  i-092 is disclosed.
