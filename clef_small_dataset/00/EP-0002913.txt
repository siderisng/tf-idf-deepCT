<ABSTRACT>
a recirculating sheet feeder (10) for a copier/duplicator  (12) has an input bin (20) capable of receiving a multiplicity  of stacks of original pages requiring processing  stack by stack, a page at a time.  control data defining the  job to be done for each stack in the input tray is introduced  as by a header card placed at the leading end of that stack,  or by an operator.  all pages of a stack being processed are  bottom fed by a drive (24) from the input bin to a processing  station (15) and thence to at least one additional bin (27,  28).  the pages are subsequently processed for additional  copies as required by bottom feeding by another drive (32,  33) from the additional bin and top stacking the copied  pages into that same bin or into yet another additional bin  (28, 27).  completion of the total number of copies is followed  by unloading the original pages from the additional  bin(s).  supplementary copying involved in a copy jam  recovery is obtained by top feeding the page requiring  recopying from the additional bin (27, 28) using the drive  (33, 34) after adjustment, the page being recopied at the  processing station, and returned to its former place in the  additional bin.
