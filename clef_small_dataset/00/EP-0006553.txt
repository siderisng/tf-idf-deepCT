<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for operating and regulating a  heat soucre (103) in a reproduction machine, particularly  for a fuser in a copier.  the machine is operable in at least  3 modes, a warm-up, a stand-by, and a copy mode.  the  amount of energy supplied to the heat source (103) depends  on the present mode of the machine and the actual tem­ perature t of the fuser: the supplied power is at level p1 during the warm-up  mode until t ≧ t1 (t1 is a given temperature).  then, po­ wer is reduced to p2.  in stand-by mode, power is increa­ sed to p2 + δ p1, if t < t2 (t2 is a given operating  temperature), and decreased to p2 - δ p1, if t ≧ t2.  in  the copy mode, power is increased to p2 + δ 2 if t ≦  t2 and increased to p2 + δ p3 if t δ t2.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for operating a heat source in a reproduction machine the invention relates to a method and an apparatus including a microprocessor for controlling and regulating the electrical energy supplied to a heat source in a reproduction apparatus, e.g. a fuser in a xerographic or similar copying or printing machine. in dry process xerographic reproduction machines, heat is often used to fuse the dry toner image to the supporting copy sheet before the copy is made available to the operator. alternatively, in xerographic reproduction machines utilizing a wet developing process, heat is extensively used to dry the prpduced copy before it is fed to the output receptacle of the copying machine. for producing this heat, both radiant heating elements and devices using heat transfer by contact, e.g. hot roll fusers, are known. u.s. patent no. 3,053,962, entitled "xerographic fusing apparatus", to a. j. cerasani et al and u.s. patent no. 4,042,804, entitled "roll fuser apparatus", to l. moser show examples for different fusers. a problem encountered in the design and utilization of copying machines employing heat fusing apparatus is the relatively large amount of thermal energy or the extended length of time required to fuse the toner to or dry the copy sheet. in dry xerographic processes, a heat fusing operation is relatively inefficient from a heat transfer standpoint and the heating unit must have sufficient capacity to raise the temperature of the toner above its melting point as the copy sheet is moved through the fusing apparatus. other significant and sometimes conflicting factors which enter into the design of heat fusing apparatus are the normal variations in ambient temperature and humidity and the character or density of the copy being fused. also, any heat fusing apparatus has a thermal storage capacity and acts as a heat sink so that less power is required to fuse an image after it has been turned on for a period of time. the problems created by these conflicting design criteria become more critical as attemps are made to provide faster xerographic copying machines which rapidly produce a large number of quality copies and also provide the first copy in any copying run in the shortest possible time. the control of xerographic fusing apparatus is addressed in u.s. patent no. 3,532,855, entitled "power regulating circuit for xerographic fusing apparatus", granted october 6, 1970 to g. w. vancleave. it discloses a circuit for regulating the power supplied to fusing apparatus employed to fuse images in a xerographic or similar copying machine. the circuit is operative to maintain a constant voltage across the heating element of the fusing apparatus under steady state operating conditions. a voltage feedback signal corresponding to the voltage across the heating element is sensed and used to control the firing angle of a thyristor or similar high capacity power supply device. the regulating circuit incorporates means for compensating for the difference between the average voltage and root mean square voltage whereby the power supplied to the heating element is maintained
