<ABSTRACT>
In this magnetoresistive transducer (10) by crossing the air gap of a C-shaped magnet (20) a be exemplified, made of magnetically permeable material part (23) with differently permeable areas. The magnetoresistive strips (11 to 14) have a means tap (15). A substrate (18) of insulating material carried by the one pole surface (21) of the C-shaped Ma (20), has first (12a, 12; 11a, 11, 11a) and second current paths (14, 14a, 13, 13a) from a magnetoresistive material. The first path (12a, 12, 11a, 11) is arranged symmetrically to a centerline (19) lying perpendicular to the direction of movement of the moving Tei les (23) and the two path (14, 14a, 13, 13a) is in two parts (14, 13) communicating, which extend to opposite sides of the first path and symmetrical to the said center line (19). The first and the second way are connected in series. These paths cooperate with cutouts (24,25) in the moving part (23) such that oppositely extending signals are generated immediately adjacent the peak signal, whereby the peak signal is highlighted and the same signal polarity change result when the moving part resulting the tip signal resulting. (23) from both possible directions of movement is achieved.
