<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for washing gases and/or recovering  heat therefrom, which apparatus includes a cylindrical  treatment vessel (1) having at the bottom thereof a gas  inlet (3) connected to a gas supply line (2) and at the top  thereof a gas outlet (4) for processed gas; a vertical rotat­ able centre shaft (5) which carries at least one cup-shaped  rotary body (6) having a plurality of openings (7), prefer­ ably vertical slots, in the side wall (8) thereof; respective  means (9, 10) cooperating with each of said rotary bodies  (6) for introducing liquid to at least one location within  said at least one rotary body (6); and a liquid outlet (11)  at the bottom of the vessel.  the liquid introduced into the rotary body or bodies  (6) is thrown as curtains of liquid through the openings  (7) against the walls of the treatment vessel by rotating  the rotary body or bodies (6).  the gas is conveyed past  the rotary body or bodies (6) on the outside thereof in a  space between the rotary body or bodies (6) and the wall  of the vessel to flow substantially upwardly along said wall  and the outside of the rotary body or bodies and trans­ versely relative to the direction of flow of the curtains of  liquid issuing from the rotary body or bodies (6).
