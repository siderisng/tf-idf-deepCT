<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides an electroplated plastics object that will withstand severe conditions without the electrodeposit separating from the substrate.  it comprises a substrate of directly plateable plastics material on top of which is electrodeposited successively (i) a nickel-based alloy layer consisting of either 5 to 50% iron and 0 to 20% cobalt or 10 to 60% cobalt, the balance being nickel which must be at least 50% in the iron-containing alloy, (ii) a layer of pure nickel or of nickel-cobalt alloy, and (iii) a layer of chromium.  further intermediate layers may also be included.

<DESCRIPTION>
an electroplated plastics object and a process for the manufa-cture thereof the present invention relates to electroplating plastics material for use in testing conditions. it is known from us patent no 3,865,699 and an article in products finishing, january 1978, pages 78 to 80 that certain plastics compositions can be directly electroplated without the need for complex and numerous pre-plating steps which are necessary when electroplating conventional plastics, for example abs (acrylonitrile-styrene butadiene copolymer). however, the use of that simple electroplating process has been hampered by the fact that the electrodeposit of a group viii metal tends to lift away from the plastics material when chromium is electrodeposited on top. a solution to this problem, disclosed in british patent specification no 1,534,638, is (i) to age the plastics object prior to plating to allow the free-radicals present to dissipate and (ii) to isolate the layer of the group viii metal from the chromium plating bath using a barrier that is imperveous to hydrogen. we have now discovered the surprising fact that it is not necessary to use the two steps specified in british patent specification no 1,534,638 when certain nickel-based alloys are used as the layer of group viii metal. in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a chromum-plated object which comprises a substrate made of, or having a surface composed of, directly plateable plastics material, a strike layer of an alloy of a metal of group viii of the periodic table electroposited directly on the substrate, a layer of corrosion-resistant nickel, and a layer of electrodeposited chromium characterised in that the strike layer is a nickel-based alloy consisting of, by weight, either from 5 to 50% iron and from 0 to 20% cobalt or from 10 to 60% cobalt, the balance in each case being, except from incidental elements or impurities, nickel, which must be present in an amount that is not less than 50% when the strike layer contains iron. the present invention also provides a process of electroplating a substrate made of, or having a surface composed of, a directly plateable plastics material with chromium, which process comprises electro-depositing directly on the substrate a strike layer composed of an alloy of a metal of group viii of the periodic table and subsequently electrodepositing a layer of corrosion-resistant nickel and a layer of chromium characterised in that the strike layer is a nickel-based alloy consisting of, by weight, either from 5 to 50% iron and from 0 to 20% cobalt or from 10 to 60% cobalt, the balance in each case being, except for incidental elements or impurities, nickel, which must be present in an amount that is not less than 50% when the strike layer contains iron. the deposit can generally withstand service conditions sc3 and sc 4 of ansi/astm specification b 604-75 which are severe service and very severe service respectively. sc 3 is given in that specification as: "service condition no sc 3 (severe) -- exposure that is likely to include occasional or

claims   1. a chromium-plated object which comprises a substrate made of, or having a surface composed of, directly plateable plastics material, a strike layer of an alloy of a metal of group viii of the periodic table electroplated directly on the substrate, a layer of corrosion-resistant nickel, and a layer of chromium characterised in that the strike layer is a nickel-based alloy consisting of, by weight, either from 5 to 50% iron and from 0 to 20% cobalt or from 10 to 60% cobalt, the balance in each case, being, except for incidental elements and impurities, nickel which must be present in an amount that is not less than 50% when the strike layer contains iron.   2. an object as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the amount of iron in the strike layer is in the range of from 6 to 25%.   3. an object as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the amount of iron in the strike layer is about 20%.   4. an object as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the amount of cobalt in the strike layer is in the range of from 30 to 60%.   5. an alloy as claimed in claim 1 or claim 4, characterised in that the strike layer is iron-free and has a thickness in the range of from 0.1 to 0.5 pin and there is deposited directly on top of the strike layer a layer of nickel that is at least 0.9   pin    thick.   6. a process of electroplating a substrate made of, or having a surface composed   of,    a directly plateable plastics material with chromium, which process comprises electrodepositing directly on the surface a strike layer composed of an alloy of a metal of group viii of the periodic table and subsequently depositing a layer of corrosion-resistant nickel and a layer of chromium characterised in that the strike layer is a nickel-based alloy consisting of, by weight, either from 5 to 50% iron and from 0 to 20% cobalt or from 10 to 60% cobalt, the balance in each case being, except for incidental elements and impurities, nickel which must be present in an amount that is not less than 50% when the strike alloy contains iron.      7. a process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the substrate is electroplated immediately after it has been moulded.   8. a process as claimed in claim 6 or in claim 7, which is substantially as hereinbefore defined.
