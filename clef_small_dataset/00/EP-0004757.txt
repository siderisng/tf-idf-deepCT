<ABSTRACT>
a capacitive non-contact gauging system comprises a  plurality of head assemblies (16) each having a plurality of  probes (60), a plurality of known capacitors (64) connected  one to each probe (60) and a plurality of amplifier output  circuits (66) connected one to each probe (60).  an oscillator  (52) feeds an oscillatory signal to each probe (60) and  capacitor (64) combination to develop at the probe (60) a  signal dependent upon the relative magnitudes of the  probe-to-workpiece capacitance and the known capacitance  (64).  a first order multiplexer (18) associated with each head  assembly (16) samples the output signals of the amplifier  output circuits (66) associated with the respective probes (60)  in that head assembly (16), and a second order multiplexer  (20) samples the first order multiplexers (18).  a plurality of  prom's (22) each associated with a respective one of the  head assemblies (16) and storing information pertaining to  the transfer characteristics of the amplifier output circuits  (66) associated with that one of the head assemblies (16) are  also arranged to be sampled by a multiplexer (24) coterminously  with the sampling of the output signals of the  amplifier output circuits (66).  a processing unit (12) receives  the sampled output signals and the correspondingly sampled  transfer characteristic information and derives therefrom  an evaluation of the respective probe-to-workpiece  distance.  the processing unit (12) further includes arrangements  for (i) autocalibration of the processing unit, and (ii)  for autocalibration of the oscillator output signal.
