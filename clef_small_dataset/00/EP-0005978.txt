<ABSTRACT>
a process is disclosed for detecting or quantifying an  antigen or antibody in a sample, in which, in a dilute  suspension under agitation, the rate of aggregation of  antibody-coated particles or antigen-coated particles as  measured by an increase in light transmission is a function of  antigen or antibody concentration.  preferably, the particles  which are coated are latex particles.  the process can be  applied as an immunoassay technique in which one or both  of antigen and antibody concentrations may be determined  by use of latex agglutination aggregometry.  the process of  the present invention is more sensitive than conventional  slide agglutination techniques.
