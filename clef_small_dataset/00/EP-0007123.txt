<ABSTRACT>
a high speed actuating mechanism for operating the con足 tacts of a circuit interrupter has an operating shaft (73) con足 nected to the contacts and to an operating piston (90).  the  operating piston (90) has a short-circuited conductve ring or  repulsion disc (160) which is closely coupled to a lenz coil  operator (151) in one position of the actuating mechanism.   the operating piston (90) also has an enlarged diameter seal足 ing protrusion (92) which seals against an annular seal (130)  which is concentric with the lenz coil operator (151) and the  sealing ring (130) are spring-mounted to have several degrees  of resiliency to enable proper relative location of the repulsion  disc (160) and the lenz coil (151) and proper relative location of  the annular seal (130) and contact protrusion (92) to control  seal penetration and to enable compensation for contact ero足 sion when butt-type contacts are used.
