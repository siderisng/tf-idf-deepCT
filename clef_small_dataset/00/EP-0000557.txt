<ABSTRACT>
a novel semiconductor laser device in which a longitudinal  and transverse mode is stabilized and in which any excess  optical noise for a modulated signal is not generated by mode  competition is provided.  the fundamental construction of the  semiconductor laser device comprises at least a structure  wherein a first semiconductor layer (3) is sandwiched between  second and third semiconductor layers (2, 4) which are  greater in the band gap and lower in the refractive index than  the first semiconductor layer.  that region of at least one of the  second and third semiconductor layers (2, 4) which is remote  from the first semiconductor layer (3) is made a semiconductor  layer which corresponds substantially to a radiation region  and which serves as a light non-absorptive region in the shape  of a stripe (9).  a semiconductor layer (1) is disposed which has  portions lying on both sides of the semiconductor layer (9)  remote from the first semiconductor layer (3) and which  makes an effective complex refractive-index for laser light  discontinuous at both the ends of the semiconductor layer  remote from the first semiconductor layer (3).  periodic corrugations  (8) which intersect orthogonally to the lengthwise  direction of the stripe-shaped light non-absorptive region are  formed in at least one interface of the aforecited semiconductor  layers in a manner to include at least a region corresponding  to the light non-absorptive region.
