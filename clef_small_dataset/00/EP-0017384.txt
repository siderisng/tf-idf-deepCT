<ABSTRACT>
a germanium component (1) is bonded to a second  component (3) of metal, or metal-surfaced ceramic, by a  braze composed of a first metal (6), which is constituted by or  deposited on the surface of the second component, one or  two additional metals (7,8) deposited on or inserted between  the component surfaces, and germanium derived from the  component, the additional metal or metals and germanium  forming an alloy, preferably an eutectic, which interacts with  the first metal to form a molten braze at a temperature below  the melting points of the components.  specifically, for the  manufacture of an infra-red window for a laser, a germanium  window is bonded to a nilo k or kovar support by coating  the latter with nickel or cobalt, introducing silver or copper  either as coatings on, or as a shim inserted between, the  mating surfaces, and heating the assembly to 680-690°c.  the  braze withstands temperatures used for outgassing the  device.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to e process for bonding a germanium component to a metal or alloy surface of 8 second component, and is also concerned with composite articles and devices which include a component of germanium and a metal- or alloy-surfaced component bonded together by the process described. the bonding of a germanium component to a component formed of, or having a surface layer composed of, z metal or alloy may be required, for exa > .le5 in the manufacture of a semiconductor device. in another type of application of germanium, which utilises its property of transparency to infra-red radiation of some wavelengths, it may be employed for forming infra-red transmitting windows in some radiation- emitting or collecting devices for example, germanium may be used to form a partially reflecting mirror in a laser, for transmitting infre.-red radiation of desired wavelengths and reflecting radiation of other wavelengths. for such applications, the germanium component is required to be mounted on, and bonded to, a metallic supporting component, which is sealed into an aperture in the main body of the device or may itself constitute the main body of the device: it is usually desirable that the germanium component and its metal support should have substantially matching thermal expansion characteristics in order to minimise stresses generated by differential expansion between these components when they are subjected to changes in temperature in manufacture or use of the device. it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for forming a vacuum-tight bond, capable of withstanding elevated temperatures without rupturin or undergoing any undesire.ble physical or chemical chan.es, between a germanium component and a metal or alloy surface of a second component. according to the invention, s process for bonding a first component composed of gerranium to a second component of which at least that jortior of the surface to be bonded to the germanium is composed of 8 metal or alloy includes the steps of providine a first metal surface which is constituted by, or fores a conti nuous adherent coating on, the said surface portion o the second component, introducing not more than two additional metals between said first metal surface and that portion of the surface of the germanium component which is to be bonded to the second component, the said first metal and additional metal or metal s being so chosen that interaction can occur between the said metals and germanium to form a molten braze composition at a temperature which is appreciably lower than both the melting points of germanium and of the metal or alloy of which the second component or the said surface portion thereof is composed, and is appreciably higher than any temperature to which the bonded components will subsequently be subjected, and brazing the components together by heating the assembly of said components and first and additional metals, while under light pressure, to a sufficiently high temperature to cause the said interaction to take place and then coolin-- the assembly to cause
