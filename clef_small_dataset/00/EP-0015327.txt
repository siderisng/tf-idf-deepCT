<ABSTRACT>
a mechanical clamping device, especially for clamping  with high force of workpieces and tools, provided with  clamping elements, characterised by an axial movable and  helical rotatable conical wall (11, 21), against which rest  similar bodies of revolution (12, 22), which are positioned  on a changeable concentric circle of centre between two  converging, concentric surfaces of revolution (13, 14, 23,  24), which are movable axially in respect of each other.  due to the extreme favourable behaviour of the rotat­ ing bodies of revolution (12, 22) which displace themsel­ ves at rotation in a helical way between the surfaces of  revolution (13, 14, 23, 24), these surfaces are rolled and  forced from each other.  by this a favourable and equally  distributed force transmission is obtained with a high de­ gree of efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
mecanical clamping device. the invention relates to a necanical clain device, especially for clasping workpieces and tools with high force, provided with clamping elements, by which through a helical rotation of an axial movable conical wall, the here against thrusting bodies of revolution are rotated to a larger or smaller circle of centre between two converging, concentrical surfaces of revolution, through which these displace themselves axially in respect to each other. with existing mecanical clamping devices the workpiece or tool is pre-clamped with a screw spindle and nut with a coarse pitch to enable fast axial displacement. clamping with high clamping force is here only possible by means of big levers, by which high friction of the screw thread has to be overcome and the spindle is subjected to big torsional stresses. exist- ing mecanical clamping devices are therefore executed with a pre-clamping device and a device for clamping with high forces. in vices the jaws are brought against the workpiece by a screw spindle, after this, a mecanisme starts working for cl & r.p4ng with high force. here is made use of a set of toggle joint levers, which are driven by means of an auxilliary spindle, through which high clapping forces are created. at daring nuts for clawing of workpieces and tools on shafts, the screw thread connection is used to clamp, while in the nuts toggle joint levers are installed, which can be turned in the so called "dead-position", by which high clamping forces are created. a disadvantage of toggle joint lever systems is, that it is impossible to obtain the desired clamping force by measuring the input force, as both forces are independent of each other. by this the danger is created that the clamping force is too big or too small, by which the workpiece deformes or loosen itself during machining. another disadvantage of the toggle joint system is that it requires a lot of space and consequently a compact design is impossible. the number of toggle joint levers is restricted due to the available space, and therefore a big clamping force is only applied through a limited number of places and consequently unequal clasping take place. the invention aims at the first place a compact and simple clamping device of the type as mentioned in the beginning, by which the aforementioned disadvantages are eliminated and the actual clamping force is in proportion to the input force, by which at the same time an equal transmission of forces takes place and of which the clamping elements are simple to install in all kinds of clamping devices. for explanation of the invention and with reference to the drawing, the operation and some examples of execution will be described. fig. 1. scheme of operation, with bodies of revolution outside the conical wall. fig. 2. scheme of operation, with bodies of revolution inside the conical wall. fig. 3. example of execution of clamping nut. fig. 4. example of execution of clamping spindle. fig. 5. example of execution of
