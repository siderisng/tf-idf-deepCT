<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical treatment cell (10) is divided by separating devices (28, 30, 32, 34, 36) into a plurality of partial cells (16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26).These partial zel len are filled up with an electrolytic solution (72) to a substantially equal height as the height of the separating directions.In the electrolytic solution, mercier current-carrying electrodes (38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48) are immersed.The metal strip (66) is guided in such a way by the part cells that it remains continuously immersed in the electrolyte solution and thus protects against overheating ge.Due to the separators, the current flow through the electrolyte between adjacent th partial cells is severely limited.
