<ABSTRACT>
two novel forms of xanthan gum containing not more  than about 400 ppm of calcium are disclosed.  xanthan gum  having this low concentration of calcium is prepared from an  aqueous fermentation medium substantially free of calcium  ion and substantially free of fermentation nutrients which  contain calcium.  when the fermentation is carried out under  conditions of high shear, the low calcium product is characterized  in that oil/water emulsions of the gum exhibit  smooth flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
low calcium xanthan gums this invention relates to xanthan gum. the preparation and uses of xanthan gum are well known to those skilled in the field of heteropolysaccharides. while aqueous compositions of xanthan gum have many desirable properties, such compositions have a chunky or non-uniform flow. the present invention is based on the discovery that there is a correlation between the calcium of xanthan gum and the flow characteristics of aqueous compositions containing xanthan gum. the invention provides a xanthan gum in which not more than about 1,6% of the xanthan gum carboxyl groups are bound to calcium ions the invention also provides a xanthan gum containing up to about 0.04 weight % calcium. the xanthan gum of the present invention, which has not more than abort 400 ppm of calcium, is prepared from an aqueous fermentation medium substantially free of calcium ion and substantially free of calcium-containing fermentation nutrients which contain calcium. when prepared under conditions cf high shear the gum provides aqueous oil/water compositions having smooth or uniform flow. in the specification the term "ppm" means parts per million by weight", mesh sizes are u.s. standards, and all parts and percentages are by weight. aqueous compositions of xanthan gum tend to have a "chunky" or non-uniform flow characteristic. a "chunky" flow is an uneven, lumpy type of flow such as is encountered with tomato ketchup. a smooth or uniform type of flow is one free of lumps and unevenness such as is encountered with vegetable oil. the aqueous compo sitions include solutions of xanthan gum as well as oil/water emulsions. in general, aqueous compositions of xanthan gum containing not more than about 0.04 weight % of calcium and fermented under high shear conditions have desirable flow properties, and aqueous compositions of xanthan gum containing not more than about 0.02 weight % of calcium and fermented under high shear conditions have best flow properties. the low calcium xanthan gum of the present invention may be prepared by a heteropolysaccharide-producing bacterium of the genus xanthomonas by the whole culture fermentation of a medium comprising a fermentable carbohydrate, a nitrogen source, and appropriate other nutrients. the bacterium may be any suitable xanthomonas species preferably x. campestris. the bacterium is grown in a medium which is substantially free of calcium ions. by substantially free is meant up to about t ppm of calcium ion per each 1% of xanthan gum concentration in the completed fermentation broth, and preferably up to about 2 ppm of calcium per each 1% of xanthan gum concentration in the completed fermentation broth. thus, if the xanthan gum is to be produced at a final concentration of about 2.1-2.3%, the total calcium ion content of the completed fermentation broth should not exceed about 9 ppm and preferably should not exceed about 5 ppm. to obtain such a low calcium medium the calcium content of the water in the fermentation medium may be reduced to the appropriate level by chemical means, e.g. ion-exchange treatment, or by distillation. as commercial
