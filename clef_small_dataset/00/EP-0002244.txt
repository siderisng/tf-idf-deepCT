<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an X-ray test apparatus for the female chest, with an X-ray beam source (3) fed from an X-ray generator and a breastfoil plate on which an X-ray film cassette is retaining.Between the X-ray source (3) and the breastfoil plate, a compression plate (8) is held in parallel with the breast charge plate, which is adjustable relative to the breastfoil plate for adjusting its spacing from the breastfoil plate.The compression plate (8) has a section (12) of such a size that a larger part of the chest is released.At the edge of the cutout, a marker (13, 14) imaging on an X-ray film is arranged for viewing a certain point in the section (12).
