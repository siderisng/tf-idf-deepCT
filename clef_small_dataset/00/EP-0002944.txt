<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method for processing a plurality  of film frame images of the same subject, particularly in  the production of a parallax stereogram, i. e. , free vision  stereogram.  the images on a film strip (83) or other plurality  of frames are optically viewed to establish homologous  points for each film frame image.  in one embodiment  two images are optically superimposed to establish a  stereo base distance.  each film frame (91) is then marked  in accordance with the homologous points or with the  stereo base distance.  the marking (90) may be mechanical  or may be optically generated.  each film frame (91) is  thereafter aligned or sensed while in an enlarger (13), the  marks (90) establishing the accurate registration of each  frame.  each film frame (91) is exposed onto a photo-sensitive  material (95) using a movable line grid (97).  a  lenticular screen (96) is superimposed over the developed  picture to form the stereoscopic photograph.
