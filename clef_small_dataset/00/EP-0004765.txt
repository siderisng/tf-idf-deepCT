<ABSTRACT>
corticosteroids of the formulae    wherein:   r¹⁶ is methyl; and   r¹⁷ independently is hydrogen, or c₂ to c₆ linear or  branched acyl or r¹⁶ and or¹⁷ taken together are the radical  (iv)    where r³ is hydrogen, c₁ to c₆ linear or branched alkyl, and  r⁴ is the same or different than r³ as defined above or is c₁  to c₆ linear or branched alkoxy or r³ and r⁴ taken together  with the carbon atom of said radical is c₄ to c₉ heterocyclic  alkyl having one heterocyclic atom that is oxygen, r²¹  independently is c₁ to c₆ linear or branched alkyl or c₄ to c₉  heterocyclic alkyl having one heterocyclic atom that is  oxygen; or or¹⁷ and or²¹ taken together are the radical (iv)  where r³ is defined above and r⁴ is c₁ to c₆ linear or  branched alkoxy; y is selected from the group methyl,  halomethyl, and the radical -ch₂oc(o)r where r is c₂ to c₆  linear or branched alkyl; z independently is c₁ to c₇ linear or  branched acyloxy, hydroxy or halo or z and or¹⁷ taken  together are the radical (iv) where r³ and r⁴ is defined  above; are useful as anti-inflammatory agents.  compounds  iii can be prepared from compounds i through compounds ii.
