<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the chemical/mechanical treatment of ground water, surface water or waste water of all types using flocculating agents, precipitating agents, flocculation auxiliary agents, loading agents and/or reaction agents adjusting the ph value, with the following process teps to be carried out successively in separate zones ; a) adding at least one of the above-mentioned agents to the untreated water, under agitation (zone i) ; b) adding recirculated contact sludge obtained from the process, as well as optionally one or more of the abovementioned agents, under agitation (zone ii) ; c) adding one or more flocculation auxiliary agents while applying an applied agitation power of more than 20 w/m**3 of the reaction volume available in this zone and while limiting the residence time to a maximum of five minutes (zone iii) ; d) reacting out the previously added agents by the absence of movement or at most moderate movement, with the formation of sedimentable particles (zone iv) ; e) separating the flocs and/or reaction products and/or the substances contained in the untreated water from the clarified water by sedimentation (zone v), in which case the sludge formed separated from the clean water is drawn off and is partly recirculated as contact sludge to the process step b, characterized in that the separation of the flocs and/or the reaction products and/or substances contained in the untreated water from water (zone v) is effected using inclined plate and/or tubular sedimentation devices, and in that at least that portion of separated sludge to be recirculated as contact sludge is additionally concentrated to a solid concentration of at least 6-20 % by weight and in the case of sudges with a high proportion of precipitation products and/or substances contained in the untreated water up to 50 % by weight, and the quantity of this contact sludge amounts to less than 3 % by volume of the total apparatus throughput.
