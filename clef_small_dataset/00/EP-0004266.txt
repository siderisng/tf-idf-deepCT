<ABSTRACT>
1.  bar support assembly for a set of power transmission bars comprising insulator elements assembled with the bars to grip the opposite lateral edges of the said bars in parallel grooves, characterised in that the insulator elements each consist of a block symmetrical in three perpendicular planes, exhibiting on two of its opposite parallel faces (6, 7) a first and a second set of parallel grooves (12, 13), the grooves of one and the same set being of the same depth, arranged mutually at 90 degrees, and permitting bars (29) of a first thickness in the case of the first set, and of a second thickness in the case of the second set, to be straddled, and fully penetrated by assembly bores (14, 15, 16 and 17) made in its planes of symmetry, at right angles to said planes, the opposite parallel faces bearing the two sets of grooves being pierced by two pairs (14, 14, 15-15) of the assembly bores, each of the pairs being arranged on either side of a set of grooves, and the other opposite parallel faces being pierced by a single central bore (16, 17).
