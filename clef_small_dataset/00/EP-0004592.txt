<ABSTRACT>
a bisimide-ether compound having the general formula  is obtained by reacting an ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic  acid anhydride, a diamine compound and a phenolic  compound having in the molecule at least two hydroxyl  groups, or by reacting a prepolymer of the anhydride and  diamine compound with the phenolic compound:    wherein r₁ is a group containing at least two carbon atoms,  r₂ is a group containing at least two carbon atoms, r′₂ is a  group containing at least two carbon atoms and a carbon-carbon  double bond, r₃ is an aromatic group, the nitrogen  atoms of the imide rings being directly connected to different  carbon atoms of the group r₁, the carbonyl groups of the  imide rings being directly connected to different carbon  atoms of the group r₂ or r′₂, the oxygen atoms between the  groups r₂ and r₃ being directly connected to an aromatic  nucleus of the group r₃, and n is an integer of zero, one or  more than 1.
