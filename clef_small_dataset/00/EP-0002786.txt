<ABSTRACT>
a retaining ring structure is adapted to be located in a  circumferential groove (22) in a first member and to engage  a second member to restrain relative axial movement  of said members under thrust loading.  the retaining ring  structure includes a ring (36) portion of l-shaped cross-section  having a leg portion (40) and a foot portion (52).   the free end of the leg portion (40) fits into the groove (22)  and the foot portion (52) engages a surface of the member  adjacent the groove.  a surface of the leg portion is adapted  to contact the side wall (26) of the groove (22) and is undercut  so as to avoid contact with the edge of the groove.   one specific retaining ring structure includes a pair of sector  ring portions (36, 38) in nested relation with the outer  apex of the l-shape of one of the sector ring portions  located at the inner apex of the l-shape of the other sector  ring portion.
