<ABSTRACT>
In a memory cell for a solid waiting memory, a loop diode (12) connected to the gate electrode (3) of a field effect transistor (2) is disclosed to derive residual charges. The read-only memory is prepared by separating selected gate lines (14) in an array of FEL dEffekttransistors with a laser beam Who. Experience has shown that the static electrical charges are isolated on the line, which are accumulated by a treatment before cutting the line, to the gate electrode after separating the gate line, so that for the field effect transistor, a non-previously sighted line state is generated, Instead of the stable locking state that is desired. By providing a drain diode (12), which also remains connected to the gate electrode (3) of the FET (2) after the separation of the gate line (14) is performed, the charges of that of which have been separated, whose gate lines have been separated. Discounted, while at the same time preventing the voltage at the gate electrode of the FET is prevented. The discharge diode (12) is rotated so that it represents a high resistance for a current driven by the gateknotene point when the gate electrode is biased for the fits of the FET. As a result, the flow of the discharge diode is kept small to the switching teshness when the gate electrode remains connected to the remainder of the circuit of the retaining memory. If the gate electrode and thus the discharge diode has been selectively separated from the remainder of the solids-saving circuit when programming the memory, then each residual charge on the gateelek trode is derived via the discharge diode, either by the leakage current in a bias voltage in the lock or normal at one Preload in passing direction, depending on the polarity of the residual charge on the gate electrode.
