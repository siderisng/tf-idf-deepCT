<ABSTRACT>
a self-fastening device for fastening ropes, cords,  cable and the like, particularly for fastening tensile stress­ ed ropes, cords, cables and the like, comprising at least a  terminal (12), a body (1) with seats (2 and 4) for a fasten­ ing member (6), a spring (3) and a cord (11), wherein the  self-fastening member (3) is shaped like a ball and is idly  and loosly pivoted on a shank (8) of a reel shaped mem­ ber (80) which is slidably mounted in a pair of slots (9)  and projects outside with a pair of operable flanges (8a  and 8b), the ball and shank size being such that in opera­ tion rolling friction conditions between self-fastening mem­ ber (6) and its seat 2 are determined.
