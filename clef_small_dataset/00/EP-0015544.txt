</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a new class of derivatives of the alpha or beta-mercaptopropionamido-acetic acid, to the process for the preparation thereof and to the use of said derivatives as active ingredient in pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions. more particularly, the present invention relates to the compounds comprised in the general formula emi1.1 wherein r is h or 2-20 c alkyl radical; r1 is h or ch3; n is 1 or 2 with the provision that when n = 1; r1 is ch3 and when n = 2, r1 is h, r2 is h or 21 ca. the derivatives of the alpha-mercaptopropionamido-acetic acid of the present invention are represented by the general formula emi1.2 the derivatives of the beta-mercaptopropionamido-acetic acid are represented by the general formula emi1.3 both in formula (ii) and (iii) r and r2 have the above mentioned meanings. according to the present invention the compounds of the formula (i) are prepared by reacting the glycine or an ester thereof with a halide of the alpha-bromo or beta-bromo-propionic acid. the thus obtained derivative of the bromo-propionamido-acetic acid is then directly reacted with the thioglycolic acid. the new process is illustrated by the following reaction scheme: emi2.1 (wherein r, r1 and n have the above meanings; x = cl, br, i) emi2.2 wherein r, r1 and n have the above defined meanings. the step (a) of the above schematized process is carried out in an inert organic solvent, not miscible with h20, such as for instance methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and in the presence of an organic base, in at least stoichiometric amount on the starting materials, able to block the hydrohalogenic acid as soon as it is formed. the reaction is carried out under strong stirring by cooling in water-ice bath, in order to preferably keep a temperature not overcoming looc. the compound (a) thus prepared is separated by concentrating the solution up to dryness and by crystallizing the residue from a suitable organic solvent. the bromo-propionainido-acetic acid or the ester thereof, obtained in step (a) are allowed to react with the thioglycolic acid in an aprotic, dipolar organic sol' vent, miscible with water, such as for instance dmfa, dmso, in the presence of at least a stoichiometric amount of an organic base able to block the hbr which is formed. the reaction is carried out under stirring, at room temperature. in the event that the free acid is allowed to react directly, the reaction can be preferably carried out in water. the final product (i) which is formed in very high yields is separated, after acidification, by different techniques according to the particular product thus formed; in the most favorable cases a filtration is sufficient; in some cases an extraction with organic solvents is necessary. in order to make easier the performance of the process according to the present invention, some examples for the preparation of the new products of this invention are given hereinafter. these examples are only illustrative and do not limit in any
