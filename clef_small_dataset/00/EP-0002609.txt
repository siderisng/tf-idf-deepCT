<ABSTRACT>
a system controlling apparatus is disclosed wherein an  array of sensors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are used for detecting  information and for providing signals as to the passing of  articles 100, such as presence of article at sensor wpc,  number of articles passing wcc, the direction of passing  wdc and the velocity of passing v, and signal processing  means 13, 14, 17, 18 are provided for comparing the signals  with pre-determined parameter information as to the system  and for providing control to control means 15 of the system  based on the information detected at a first sensor as  determined by the processing means 13, 14, 17, 18 and an  overriding control if the information detected from an  adjacent sensor is different.  each of the sensors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  disclosed is self-checking whilst an article 100 is not present.   the information detected by the sensors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is  converted to a simple binary high or low signal and such  binary signals from all sensors are compared in a "look-up"  table comparator 13 arranged to recognize a particular  pattern of highs and lows at its input and to provide an  output to the control means 15 if it is in accordance with a  pre-determined pattern corresponding to the pre-determined  parameter information of the system.
