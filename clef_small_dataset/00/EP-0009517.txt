<ABSTRACT>
contraceptive device for use within the vaginal cavity at a posn.  posterior to the introitus and near to the cervicalos is shaped to be retained in the vagina.  it has a container(s) fixed to it, and each container wall is at leats partly of non-porous semipermeable membrane.  the container holds a reservoir of spermicide comprising aq.  micelle-forming spermicidal surfactant (i) at a concn.  \- the critical micelle cocn.  of the (i).  the container(s) is kept in posn.  by an approp.  arrangement that ensures that the membrane is on the face of the device to form a transport surface.  the device can be inserted into the vagina by the user and when in posn. , it remains there even during intercourse.  the devices are designed to remain in the vagina during the time between menstrual period with prolonged release of (i).

<DESCRIPTION>
vaginal contraceptive the present invention encompasses devices which are nsed in the vagina to deliver sperrnicidal surfactants. by virtue of their unique construction and shape, the devices remain in position, even during intercourse, so that delivery of the spermicidal surfactant is not interrupted. be devices of this invention are designed for use in the vagina, can be inserted by the user, and do not require invention by a physician as, for example, in the case of intrauterine contraceptive devices. the devices are designed to remain in the vagina during the time between menstrual periods to provide desirable, prolonged release of a spermicidal sareactant, and their construction and shape facilitate retention therein. an effective hetween-period. contraceptive device is thereby provided. sw8^lmz summary of xxe invention the present invention combines the desirable features of devices which provide prolonged release of medicaments, e.g., spermicides, or the like, into the vaginal area with the added advant ges that the unique construction and shape of the present devices allows them to be worn comfortably in the vagina for periods of several weeks and to remain substantially undisturbed within the vaginal cavity during sexual intercourse. most importantly, the construction of the present devices allows them to be positioned in the vagina in such a way that maximum contraceptive protection is secured. as can be seen by reference to the figures herein, the highly preferred devices of the present type for use within the vaginal cavity are characterized by a dome-shaped construction and comprise one or more con tainers, said containers having walls which allow passage of spermicidal surfactant monomers from within the containers into the vagina. the configuration of the devices allows them to be placed in the closest possible proximity to the cervical os, and this feature contributes importantsy to their contraceptive efficacy. indeed, the highly preferred dome-shaped devices herein substantially surround and "cap" the cervical os. the contraceptive devices of this invention make use of the association colloid nature of solutions of certain spermicidal surfactants to provide a reservoir from which spermicide is released in a controlled manner through the semi-permeable membrane which comprises at least a portion of the wall of the container: surfactant micelles, as is, cannot diffuse through the semi-permeable membrane; they must first dissociate, at or remote from the membrane, to individual surfactant molecules which then dissolve in the membrane material and diffuse therethrough to its outer surface, whereupon the surfactant monomers are free to dissolve in the surrounding vaginal fluid to provide their contraceptive effect. since the predominant driving force for diffusion is the concentration difference between unassociated (i.e., monomeric) surfactant molecules in the solution inside and outside the contraceptive device, the rate of transport will slow drastically when the exterior surfactant monomer concentration approaches that on the interior of the device, thus producing a desirable controlled release behavior of the surfactant through the membrane. in the present devices, the bulk of the surfactant remains in mice liar form, where it resides in reserve to provide 2 source of
