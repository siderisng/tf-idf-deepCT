<ABSTRACT>
an additive tri-colour lamp house (10) having three  lamps (14,16,18) for conveying filtered light into a mixing  chamber (54) and illuminating a photographic image con­ tained on a photographic film.  the illuminated image is  then projected onto a photosensitive paper for the purpose  of making photographic prints and copies.  the lamp house  (10) is characterized by having a combination of additive  primary colour filters (24,26,28) and subtrative primary col­ our filters (34,38,42,44) positioned in front of the lamps and  the amount of each additive primary colour (i. e.  red, green  and blue) conveyed through the filters  (24,26,28,34,38,42,44) is controlled.  by the proper positioning of the colour filters in front  of the lamps (14,16,18), the time required for proper  exposure of the three separate emulsion layers on conven­ tional colour print paper is approximately equal.
