<ABSTRACT>
1.  lockable pivot wheel for movable apparatus, in particular refuse or the like containers, having a strong walled pivot bearing head (2) comprising a downwardly drawn floor (2') and an upwardly drawn wide-faced rim for fixing to the apparatus and a pivot fork (3) carrying the rotatable roller wheel (4) as well as a brake body (5) serving for the rotary locking thereof, whose back (3') is rotatably fixed to a ball race disc (8) lying above the pivot bearing head floor (2) and having its upper side free of ball races by way of a connecting bush (9) passing freely through a central opening in the pivot bearing head floor (2'), whereby a series of balls (6, 7) is arranged respectively between the ball race disc (8) and the pivot bearing head floor (2'), on the one hand, as well as between the latter and the pivot fork back (3') on the other hand, and a control pin (10) for the operation of the brake body (5) is axially slidably arranged in the connecting bush (9) against spring pressure and, furthermore, a device for the pivot locking of the pivot fork (3) is provided which comprises a non-rotatably guided locking plate (11) axially slidable by means of the control pin (10), characterised in that the locking plate (11) arranged in the pivot bearing head (2) above the ball race disc (8) engages non-rotatably in openings (15) present in the pivot bearing head wall (2"') by means of projections (11") on its periphery and is to be brought into blocking pivot locking engagement with the ball race disc (8).
