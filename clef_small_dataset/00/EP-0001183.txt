<ABSTRACT>
an up-wash, up-flow filter has an arrangement to hold  the filter media in position during filtering but to allow the  media to rise during washing.  in order to hold the filter media firmly against the pressure  of upward flowing liquid during filtering, an imperforate  diaphragm (20) is provided movable between an applied position  and a released position by pressurised fluid supplied by  an inlet (42) located above the diaphragm.  the filter housing  (12) is flared upwardly and outwardly to allow a greater range  of sizes of filter media.
