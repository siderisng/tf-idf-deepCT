<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for control of a stationary fan-cooled  cooling system, especially of a large diesel engine  (14), having a heat exchanger (10) through which airflow  is passed by fans (15) driven by motors (16).  to avoid waste of power by motors (16), and to extend  their life, all the fluid to be cooled is continuously circulated  through the heat exchanger (10) and one of a  number of fans (15) is caused by a sequence control system  (18) to start operation on increase in fluid temperature  sensed by a sensor (17), and one to stop on decrease of  temperature, the control system (18) selecting the fan  each time in accordance with a criterion related to running  time.  the control system (18) may start a fan after a short  delay on increase of temperature, and stop one after a  substantial delay on decrease of temperature.
