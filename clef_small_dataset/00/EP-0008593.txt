<ABSTRACT>
1.  a thermostatic regulating device for controlling the flow of a heating or cooling medium through a heat exchanger for controlling the temperature of a room, in which at least one heating and one cooling valve are connected to a common expansion temperature sensor and a set-valve adjusting device, a liquid serving as the expansion medium in each valve acting agaisnt the force of a return spring via a movable intermediate member on the spindle bearing the valve member and the return spring of the cooling valve having a different strength from the spring of the heating valve, characterized in that the heating valve (3) and cooling valve (3') are of identical construction, apart from the return springs (24 and 39), and the intermediate member (22) moving at right angles to the valve spindle (33) has a surface (31) having a trough-like cross-section in the direction of motion and two oblique control edges operating in opposite directions and controlling the position of the valve member via a roller member, the distance between the control edges being greater than the diameter of the roller member (34) and the roller member (34) being mounted substantially without clearance in the axial direction of the intermediate member (22).
