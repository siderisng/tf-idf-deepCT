<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for obtaining methane simultaneously from a plurality of fluves by forming a column system above and below a flozes and is dissipated by methane via this with the aid of at least one at least partially drilled borehole. From over days, at least one borehole is introduced to a predetermined floence, which is generated in the flor, a number of coal coals separated by carbon blacks is generated until the coal coals remaining between the cavities and suddenly collapsing under the influence of static mountain pressure. From the rooms in which no high pressure is to prevail, the then releasing methane is won over at least one borehole. Preferably, in the resulting cavities, a pressure is maintained, which forms a back pressure to the static mountain pressure, in such a way that the coal does not fall in at a certain width of the cavities and a certain width of the intermediate shocks. After completion of the cavities, this pressure is reduced so far that the coal shafts go to break and the slilling end. The coal shafts can also be destroyed by explosives.
