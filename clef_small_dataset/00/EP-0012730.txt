<ABSTRACT>
balanced microwave receiver converter wherein two  capacitively coupled diodes (5) are each connected to  ground via a reactance.  the rf input signal is applied to the  diodes via a ridged waveguide, in which a susceptance is  positioned at a distance from the diodes, providing for both  radiofrequency matching and reflection of image oscilla­ ton.  the if output lines (3) are connected to the diodes (5)  by two helical inductive elements (12), coupled to ground  via the projections (17).  the local oscillator signal is applied  through a waveguide line, formed by a waveguide (20)  crossed by a cylindrical conductor (21), to the diodes (5) by  capacitive coupling (c1).  the waveguide line is shunted by a  resistor at a predetermined distance from the diodes (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
improvement in microwave receiver converters having a hybrid waveguide structure description this invention relates to an improvement in microwave receiver converters having a hybrid waveguide structure. it is known that one of the most important problems to be faced in the design of receiver converters is that of minimizing as far as possible the noise of these devices. however it is evident that the solution of the problem lies in achieving such objectives as the obtaining of special electrical characteristics (e.g. the bandwidth and range of operation, linearity for high input signals, impedance presen ted at the working frequency etc.) or structural and technological characteristics (mic type structures or classical type structures designed with more or less sophisticated functions or operation, diodes in chip form or diodes incapsulated in robust and manageable packages) or functional characteristics (e.g. degree of deterioration of the characteristics due to failure of a diode in the case of a balanced converter; or due to variation of the power of the local oscillation (l.o.): capacity of overcoming special mechanical or electrical require ments? etc.). in the litterature (torrey & whitmar - "crystal rectifiers"mitvol. 15; mohr & br< kwitt.
