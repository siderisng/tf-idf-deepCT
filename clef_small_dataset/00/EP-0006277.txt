<ABSTRACT>
a infra-red detector and envelope arrangement for the  detector have a novel mount (21, 22, 23, 24) for a joule-Â­ thomson or other cooling element (10).  the mount is a  single unit (21, 22, 23, 24) which includes an inner part  (23) on which the cooling element (10) is mounted e. g.   via an adaptor (30).  the cooling element (10) is secured in  a dewar (1, 2) of the envelope arrangement by attaching  an outer part (21, 22) of the mount (21, 22, 23, 24) to a  dewar-mount (13) e. g.  by bolts (22).  these inner and outer  parts (23 and 21, 22) which may have overlapping flanges  are elastically coupled together by a resilient part (24) of  the unit (21, 22, 23, 24).  the resilient coupling reduces  movement and strain of the inner dewar wall (1) caused  by movement of the cooling element both during assembly  and use of the detector.  a fluid inlet (51, 52) may be present  on said outer part (22, 21), and a flexible pipe (11) may  extend between the outer and inner parts (21, 22 and 23)  to connect said inlet (51, 52) to said cooling element (10).
