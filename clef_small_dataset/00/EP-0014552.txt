<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for the corona discharge treatment of a travel足 ling web such as a plastics or cellulose film comprises a pair of  spaced conductors (2, 3) with an associated alternating vol足 tage power supply (1) set at such a distance apart that the  possibility of spark or arc discharge is avoided, at least one  conductor having mounted thereto an electrode member (5)  extending towards the other conductor to define a gap (7)  across which a corona discharge can be formed.  the elec足 trode member (5) consists of a dielectric material having a  dielectric constant of at least 8, preferably at least 80, and may  consist of a plate with an edge directed towards the other  conductor.  preferably the plate is formed of one or more  ceramic tiles based upon a titanium and/or zirconium com足 pound.  in another form the electrode member consists of a  row of rods or two or more rows of spaced rods (10, 11) in  staggered relationship.
