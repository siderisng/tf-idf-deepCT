<ABSTRACT>
a time division multiple access communications system comprises, in order to distribute control of bus access and communication link formation over a plurality of terminals in the system, in which subscriber terminals (14, 16, 18) contend for transmission time slots and which accommodates both high and low duty cycle subscribers by controlling slots allocations and contention slot transmissions, a common signal path (10, 12) and a set of terminals (14, 16, 18) coupled to said path (10, 12), said set including means (20, 22, 24) for establishing one or more communication links over said path (10, 12) between one or more of said terminals (14, 16, 18), and means (26) for transferring digital signals between linked terminals, in one or more time slots associated with said links, said time slots being in a repetitive framed sequence, each of said terminals (14, 16, 18) having an associated address and including means to identify and receive correspondingly addressed digital signals on said path (10, 12).
