<ABSTRACT>
the circuit arrangement according to the invention for monitoring the timing of busy states essentially consists of a storage arrangement for accommodating addresses of the devices to be monitored, the busy state and the time value specifying the monitoring time, which is counted down step by step to a limit value.  when this limit value is reached, a signal is output which, together with the information on the busy state and the address of the relevant device, which is also available, leads to a switching action (release and so forth) in the monitored device.  this provides the possibility of central monitoring which occurs independently of other control procedures, and the size of the memory is not directly dependent on the number of devices to be monitored.
