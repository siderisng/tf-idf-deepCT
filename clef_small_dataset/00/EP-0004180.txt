<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for collecting eggs (e) from a number of poultry  cages (21) includes a collector conveyor belt (30) for  receiving the eggs (e) from the cages (21), and a ramp conveyor  belt (40) for de-escalating the eggs (e) from the collector  conveyor belt (30).  the cage bottoms are extended to  provide a trough in which the collector conveyor belt (30) is  carried.  opposite the cages (21), strips (35) of low-friction  material act as bumpers to maintain without damage eggs  upon the collector conveyor belt (30).  a diagonal fence is  provided above the collector-ramp belt conveyor junction  point to encourage easy, undamaged egg transfer action  from the collector conveyor belt (30) to the ramp conveyor  belt (40).  resilient fingers mounted in rows upon the ramp  conveyor belt (40) encourage undamaged egg de-escalation.   an accumulator belt conveyor (60) receives the eggs (e) from  the ramp conveyor belt (40) and carries the eggs (e) to an  accumulation point.
