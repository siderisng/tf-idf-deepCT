<ABSTRACT>
In a basic circuit of an integrated transistor logic, a constantly powered injector is attached to the base of a first normally operated transistor (T5). Depending on an additionally supplied logical input signal, the current is injected either into the base, so that the transistor (T5) is conductive, or derived from the base, so that the transistor (T5) is locked. The semiconductor zones forming the collector and the base of the first transistor (T5) simultaneously represent the collectors and bases of additional second transistors (T2, T3, T4) whose emitters form the outputs of the logical basic circuit. The second transistors (T2, T3, T4) likewise conductive in the switching state with conductive first transistor (T5) are operated in an inverse direction. This arrangement ensures primarily that even with the occurrence of short circuits or leakage current paths due to the base zones of the transistors, the functionality of the circuit is maintained in most cases.
