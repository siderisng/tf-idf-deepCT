<ABSTRACT>
instant pasta products are produced by the steps of: cook­ ing a band of alimentary paste to a ready to eat state; quench­ ing and rinsing the band and predrying it to a water content of  about 14% to 50%w/w, preferably 20% to 24%w/w; stretch­ ing the band to cause cracks to develop in the surface thereof;  and cutting up and drying the stretched band to provide the  desired instant pasta product.  predrying and stretching may  each be performed in one or several steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for producing instant pasta products this invention relates to a process for producing pasta products which can be prepared for consumption by moistening hem with hot, especially boiling water and chortly allowing them to stand (instant pasta products) by precooking alimentary paste shaped bodies in an aqueous medium, quenching and rinsing shape paste articles cooked to a ready-to-eat state with cold water and subsequently drying said bodies. pasta products have long been a well-krown food popular with practically all peoples of the world. they are inexpensive, they may be obtained in good quality from raw materials which, unlike the high-grade flours needed for high-quality bread, ray be produced also by a relatively primitive mill industry, and they have a 3ong shelf life even where no preservatives are added and/or expensive storage is dispensed with. as a result of these circumstances they have become a true staple foo in many countries in the light of this it was only logical that pasta products were among the first foods to be manufactured industrially and that these industrially products today have largely replaced hom-made pasta products. in spite of all their advantages pasta products, regardless of their origin, show 2 disadvantage as far as their relatively inconvenient and especially time-consuming preparation is concerned, which has long been regard as disturbing and which is one of the reasons why pasta products have on only slow and limited acceptance in some regions which cannot be regarded as traditional "pasta-eating countries". this disadvantage has become even male conspicuous as quick-cooking products were developed in connection with other foods. the food industry )as therefore or decades been making intensive efforts to develop pasta products with a reduced cooking time and, after this problem had been rolled whore or less satisfactorily, to develop ala "instant pasta products" as defined above. although the pattern to be followed for the purpose - precooking of the raw shaped paste articles, csuenclling and rinsing of the pasta products cooked to a ready-to-eat state, and subsequent drying by the manufactuerer - at first sight appeared to be easy, transmitting this principle into practice then turned out to be rather difficult. difficulties were encountered mainly on account of two problems, i.e. the tendency of the paste articles to stick to one another during cooking and/or subsequent treatment and the problem of manufacturing products with proper rehydrating properties. these difficulties so far have not been solved in satisfactory way, at least as far as pasta products are concerned which, in terms of composition and shape, meet the expectations commonly placed in such products. there have been processes disclosed permitting "pasta productsts of a special type customary in asia, notably japan, i.e. so-called "ramen noodles", to be produced which show instant properties as defined in this invention. however, these instant ramen noodles are precooked in line with the classical japanese method of preparation according to which they are parboiled in an aqueous medium and are then cooked to a ready-to-eat state in the presence of

 claims   1. a process for producing pasta products which can be prepared  for consumption by moistening them with hot, especially  boiling water and shortly allowing them to stand (instant  pasta products) by precooking alimentary paste shaped  bodies in an aqueous medium, quenching and rinsing the  shaped paste bodies cooked to a ready-to-eat state with cold  water and subsequently drying said bodies, characterized in  that  (a) the alimentary paste in the form of a band whose thickness  exceeds the desired wall thickness of the finished instant  pasta product is cooked to a ready-to-eat state in a water  bath,  (b) the paste band which has been cooked to a ready-to-eat  state and has been quenched and rinsed with cold water  in the manner known is predried to a water content of  about 14 to about 50% w/w.    (c) the predried paste band is stretched until its thickness  corresponds approximately to the desired wall thickness  of the finished instant pasta product, with the proviso  that the ratio of thickness prior to stretching to the wall  thickness after   stretching    (stretching ratio) is so selected  that cracks develop in the surface of the paste band during  stretching,  (d) the paste band is divided in the manner known into paste  articles of the desired shape and dimension,    ard ,  >        (e) is finally dried to a residual water content   coupon    for  pasta products,  on the understanding that process steps (c) and (d) or (d)  and (e) may be carried out simultaneously or in the opposite  order.   2. the process of claim 1, characterized in that paste bands with  a thickness from about 0.5 to 3,preferably from 0.7 to   1.8,     and   especially    0.8 to 1.2 mm are precooked.   3. the process of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the paste  band is precooked in the form of an endless band or of paste  band sections cut to length, said paste band being passed  through the water bath preferably continuously and especially  on a path which is longer than the distance between the point  at which the paste band enters the water bath and the point at  which it leaves the water bath.      4. the    process of one of the foregoing claims 1 to 3,   caracterized     in that in process step (b) the paste band is predried to a  water content from 16 to 27, preferably 18 to 26 and especially  20 to 24 % w/w.      5.    the process of one of the foregoing claims 1 to 4, characterized  in that the pre-drying step (b) is performed in two or more  stages, the paste band being stretched after each   pre-dryir.g     stage.   6. the process of one of the foregoing claims 1 to 5, characterized  in that in process step (c) the paste band is stretched pre  ferably by means of a rolling mill with a positive slip,  especially a two-roll stand, at a stretching ratio from  1.2 : 1 to 4 : 1, preferably from 1.5 : 1 to 3 : 1 and  especially from 1.6 : 1 to 2.4 : 1.    7. the process of one of the foregoing claims 1 to   6    characterized    in that in process   step.(d)    the paste band is divided by  means of cutting and/or punching tools.   8. the process of one of the foregoing claims 1 to 7, characterized  in that process step (a) is performed in a water bath con  taining additives, especially seasonings and/or processing  aids.   9. the process of one of the foregoing claims 1 to 8, characterized  in that in process step (a) the   water bath    is circulated and  is moved through the cooking zone preferably in countercurrent  to the paste band.
