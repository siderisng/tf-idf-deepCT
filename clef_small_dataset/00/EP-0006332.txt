<ABSTRACT>
mounting of extended area articles by attachment  system co-operating with edge regions of the article.  the  system connects articles such as visors (1) in face-to-face  relationship with a vehicle rear screen which is held in place  by an elastomeric moulding (2a) and includes two main  types of component (39; 25, 35) one with one part entering  between the surface (2) and the moulding (2a) to lock in  place and a second part (43) forming a slot (45) for the  artcle edge (6, 7).  the second component is a two part  arrangement with the first engaging between the article  edge and the surface (2) and having a boss (34) with a key­ way (33).  the second part (25) includes a key element (32)  for engagement with the keyway and is rotatably mounted  in the edge region of the article.  the two types of com­ ponent normally co-operate with opposed edges of the  article.

<DESCRIPTION>
mounting extei@@d area articles by attachnent syste@ co-operating sith edge regions of the articles this invention relates to the mounting of articles having an extended area such that the articles can effectively cover extended area surfaces by an attachment system which co-operetes with the edge regions only of the articles and ulso the surfaces. in particular the invention is concerned with the mounting of such articles so es to cover sheets of glass under conditions in which it is not possible to make use of scres, pins or the like or the use of adhesives. a particular application of the system of the invention is to the mounting of a visor to cover the rear scrcen of a motor vehicle. as is well known the screens of motor vehicles are usually retained in place solely by an endless elastomerie moulding which provides not only a seatin for the screen but also a weather proof joint with the bodywork of the vehicle. in view of the above it will be clear that any arrangement for mounting a visor must be such that it does not damage or blemish the body@@rk of the vehicle surrounding the scrcen, does not interfere with the weather sealing of the sorcen, is able to whthetand the streeses and strains introduced by the movenjonts of the vehicle (nd the effects of the varion@ weather conditions encountelied by the vehicle. also the mounting must be such as to enable the visor to be readily fitted and removed without the need for complicated tools and location arrangemente. a further difficulty inherent in the provision of attachment arrangements arises from the point that the rear screens of vehicles occur in a wide variety of shapes i.e., rectsn0ular, trapezoidal and in a variety of profiles i.e., flat or curved in one or more planes. it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved mounting arrangement for extended area articles such as visors which overcomes or at least reduces the effects of the above mentioned difficulties, according to the present invention there is provided a system for attaching an extended area article in face-to-face relationship with a surface connected to a support therefor by means of an elastomeric retaining element defining the border of the surface and connecting solely with the periphery of the surface, the system comprising; at least one first type of rotaining neans having a firet part adapted to enter betwcen the clement and said surface so an to be gripped therebetween, and a second part groviding a slot-like opening fer receiving and locating an edge of the article, the system forther comprising at leart one second type of retaining nano ineluding a first part operationally similar to the first part of the first type of retaining means and a second part having a locking element which is adapted to be engaged by 2 complementary locking element provided upon the article at such position that it is cc-operable with the associated second type of retaining means,
