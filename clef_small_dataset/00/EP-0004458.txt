<ABSTRACT>
a fabric is made up of an elongated strip of a hairycoated  skin of a fur-bearing animal.  the fabric is formed  by twisting the strip such that the skin (28) forms a core  and the hair (30) stands substantially radially outward  therefrom.  the twisted strip is then combined with like  twisted strips and also, if desired, one or more threads or  cords (42) of non-furry material, and is knitted, crocheted  or woven to form the fabric.
