<ABSTRACT>
in a modular, expandable organ system comprising a  plurality of large scale integrated circuit (lsi) chips an lsi chip  (286) is provided which produces frequencies corres­ ponding to notes played on an organ keyboard.  outputs of  different duty cycles (230, 138, 140, 142, 144) of rectangular  waves are provided for best simulating desired sounds.  other  outputs are provided in which the notes are in octave groups  (244) facilitating filtering thereof.  each group of outputs has  different attack and decay (162, 190, 228, 246) charac­ teristics respectively under the control of the organist so that  similar or different typs of attack and decay may be provided on  different outputs.  the present lsi chip provides three generators (26, 36a,  36b) on one chip.  the chips are capable of being  interconnected (290) such that any multiple of three generators  may be provided.
