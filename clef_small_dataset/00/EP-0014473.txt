<ABSTRACT>
The rotor (16) of a rotating motor vehicle mirror is mounted on an axis and carries a mirror.The inlet and outlet ends of a number of Acceptor.Intake holes (19) lie on the axially opposite sides of the rotor, lead through the rotor and put a relatively high resistance of the air flow mung, so that a negative pressure is formed at the outlet end of the intake bores.A driven by the wind turbine fan sucks air from the number of suction holes and promotes them to the spin back side.Between the axis (6) and the rotor (16) there is such a bearing clearance that is sucked between the axis (6) and the rotor (16) due to the negative pressure on the lease side of the intake holes (19) air and an air cushion betweenthe axis and the bearing bore of the rotor is formed.
