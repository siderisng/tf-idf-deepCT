<ABSTRACT>
vaginal contraceptive device comprising a back (12)  which constitutes vaginal retaining means, reinforcing means  (13) for said back and a front face (11), affixed to said back,  comprising a semipermeable membrane for a spermicidal  surfactant solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
vagina contraceptive the present invention enco#passes devices which are mused in the vagina to deliver spermicidal surfactants. by virtue of their unique construction and shape, the devices herein are foldable for easy insertion. once in position at the cervical os, the devices open to "cap" the os and rcmain in position, even during intercourse, so that access of the sper#icidal surfactant source to the cervical os is not interrupted. the devices of this invention are designed for use in the vagina, can be inserted by the user, and do not require insertion by a physician as, for eyanple, in the case of intranterine contraceptive devices. tbe devices are designed td iemain in the vagina during the time between menstrual periods to provide desirable, prolonged release of a epexmicidal surfactant, and their construction and shape facilitate retention therein an effective between-period contraceptive device is thereby provided. t ] uc devices of the present invention combine the desirable features of devices which provide prolonged release of rnedicair#nts, e.g., spermicides, or the like, through a membrane and into the vaginal area with the added advantages that the unique construction and shape of the present devices allow them to be worn ccmfortably- in the vagina for periods of several weeks and to remain substantially undisturbed within the vaginal cavity during sexual intercourse. for devices to open after insertion and be retained over the cervical os, they need to be stiff enough to main tain their general shape during wear. the necessary stiffness may be provided by incorporating a rim into the -devices. while this allows a device to be positioned and retained well, a rim can undesirably cause awareness of the device during wear and during intercourse. on the other hand; a device that is soft and com..pliant conforms well to the vagina and also results in minimal awareness during wear or during intercourse. however, if such rimless devices are too soft or compliant, they will not open to cover the cervix in use. the construction of the present devices allows them to be positioned in the vagina in such a way that maximum contraceptive protection is secured. as can be seen by reference to the figures herein1 the highly pre ferred devices of the present type for use within the vaginal.cavity are chnracterized by a comfortable, substantially riln'lcss constructioll and comprise one or more co#ilainers, said containers having walls which allow passage of spermicidal surfactant monomers from within the containers into the vagina. the configuration of the devices allows them to be placed in the closest possible proximity to the cervical os, and this feature contributes importantly to their contraceptive efficacy. indeed, the highly preferred devices herein substantially surround and "cap" the cervical cs. by the present invention, rimless confortable devices which open after insertion into the vagina are manufactured by incorporating reinforcing means across the back of the device. the resulting devices open after insertion, conform well to the vagina, and result in minimal awareness during wear or during intercourse. the reinforcing
