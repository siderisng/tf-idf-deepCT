<ABSTRACT>
an i. c.  engine fuel system includes a main fuel control  (19) which controls fuel flow to the engine in accordance with  one or more engine parameters.  a roughness sensor circuit  (11) produces an output related to the roughness of running  of the engine and the error between this roughness output  and a reference signal is integrated with respect to time by  an electronic integrator 15.  the output of this integrator (15)  is used to modify the fuel flow to reduce the error to zero, by,  for example, varying the frequency of a clock (18) which  influences the operation of the main fuel control (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to fuel control- system for an internal combustion engine. it- has been observed that when the fuel-Ã¡ir mixture supplied to an internal combustion engine is. too lean- the running of the engine becomes rough, that is to say the instantaneous speed of the engine fluctuates rapidly within an engine cycle. such rough running has been found to be associated with undesirable increases in noxious exhaust emissions. measurement of engine roughness has already beenproposed and it is possible to derive an electrical signal representative of the magnitude of the speed fluctuations in relation to the average engine'speed,- the application of a roughness sensor to an engine fuel control system is, however, problematic because of, among other difficulties, the lag which occurs between a change in the fuel supply rate and a resultant change in the engine roughness it is thus an object of the invention to provide an internal combustion engine fuel control system including an engine roughness control0 an internal combustion engine. fuel. control system in accordance with the invention includes a roughness sensor circuit providing an electrical roughness signaldetermined by the magnitude of fluctuations in the speed of the engine, an electronic integrating circuit connected t.o-said sensor circuit and providing at its output an electrical output signal representative of the tbe intealof fflhe error between 'the roughness signal and- a reference signal, and fuel flow control means for controlling the fuel flow to the engine in accordance with said output signal such that said error is reduced to zero. the time constants andgain of the integrating circuit are arranged so that changes in said output signal occur relatively slowly. the invention also provides a method of eontrelling an internal combustion engine comprising measuring the roughness of the engine running so as to derive an electri- cal signal dependent on the magnitude of .fluctuations in the. engine speed, deriving a further electrical signal depend ent on the time integral of the error between said first mentioned signal and a reference signal, and using said further electrical signal to modify the rate of fuel flow to the engine, so as to tend to reduce said error to sero in the accompanying drawings: figure 1 is a block diagram of an example of a fuel control circuit in accordance with the invention; figure 2 is an electric circuit diagram of a rough ness sensor circuit forming a part of the circuit shown in figure 1; figures 3 and 4 are circuit diagrams of a further part of the circuit of figure 1; and figure 5 is a graph showing wave forms at. a series of positions in figures 2,r3'and 4e referring firstly to figure 1, the circuit shown includes an'engine crankshaft position transducer circuit 10 which produces output pulses at fixed positions of the engine crankshafto by way of example a transducer which produces one pulse for every 180 of rotation of the engine shaft may be used. this transducer provides input pulses- to a roughness sensor circuit 11
