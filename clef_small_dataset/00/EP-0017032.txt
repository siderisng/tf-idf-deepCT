<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to production of solid state  devices by a process which includes at least one pattern  delineation step involving dry etching of a negative resist  deposited as a film on a substrate and obtained by mixing a  host polymer with one or more monomers capable of being  locked into place by electromagnetic radiation.  the film is  selectively irradiated, fixed, for example by heating or vac­ uum or both, to remove unlocked monomer or monomers  from the film, and etched by means of an oxygen-containing  plasma.  the rate of removal is higher in the unirradiated  region than in the irradiated region, yielding a negative  resist pattern.  a sensitizer may be added to allow use of  various radiation wavelengths.  desirable properties of  monomer and host polymer materials are discussed, and  exemplary specific compositions given of aromatic mono­ mers, silicon-containing monomers, and chlorinated poly­ mers.
