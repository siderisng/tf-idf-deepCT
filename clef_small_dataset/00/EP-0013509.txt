<ABSTRACT>
in a method of joining a pair of metal parts (11,12) one of  the parts (12) is provided with an insulative coating (14) at its  surface to be joined to the other part (11), while the joining  surface of the other part (11) is free of any coating and defines  a plurality of substantially parallel, longitudinally extending  spines (13).  to effect the required join, the joining surfaces of  the parts (11,12) are urged into interengagement and are  simultaneously caused to undergo relative vibrational  movement in a direction substantially parallel with the splines  (13) on said other part (11).
