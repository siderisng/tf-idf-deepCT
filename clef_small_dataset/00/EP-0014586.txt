<ABSTRACT>
a light assembly (28) is removably mounted, by a  supporting member (54), upon a lift truck load carriage (22) to  provide a light source (32) positioned adjacent the bottom  thereof and rearwardly of a load-engaging fork (26) thereby  forwardly and substantially horizontally to project light and a  shadow of the fork (26) which aids the lift truck operator  accurately to determine the fork elevation relative to a load  stack, especially when operating in a high-lift position.  upon  lowering the load carriage (22) below a predetermined  position the light assembly (28) is caught by and transferred to  a fixed supporting member (60) on the lift truck mast (16, 17)  so that it is protected from contact with the floor.  it is then also  tilted so that light is projected downwardly.  upon subsequent  elevation of the carriage (22) above the predetermined  position a reverse transfer of the light assembly takes place  from the mast to the carriage.
