<ABSTRACT>
a fluid fuel burner system (10) for minimum production  of nox under varying rates of fuel firing and varying rates of  combustion air or oxidant supply, which comprises a fuel  burner (12) including means (14, 16) for burning liquid and  gaseous fuels respectively.  liquid fuels are burned in an  axial burner tube (48) and the gaseous fuels are burned in a  plurality of gas burner tubes (42) located in a circle coaxial  with the liquid burner.  a first air or oxidant plenum (20)  supplies primary-plus-secondary air (66) or oxidant, the  primary air (52) or oxidant going to the liquid burner (94) and  the secondary air (63) or oxidant going to the gas burner (44).   the total of primary plus secondary is less than stoichiomet­ ric flow so that the combustion of the fuel in a first  combustion chamber (80) provides a reducing atmosphere  to preclude the formation of nox.  means (60) are provided  for independently controlling the primary air or oxidant flow  compared to the secondary air or oxidant flow, or vice versa.   a second air or oxidant plenum (24) provides tertiary air (68)  or oxidant to a second combustion space (82) downstream of  the first combustion chamber (84).  control means (30)  provide independent control of the primary-plus-seconday  air (66) or oxidant flow to the first plenum (20) as a selected  ratio to the tertiary air (68) or oxidant, that flows to the  second plenum (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
low wox burner this invention lies in the field of liquid and gaseous fuel burning. more particularly, this invention concerns fuel burning apparatus in which the design of the burner and control of the fuel and air or oxidant supply is separately controllable for primary, secondary and tertiary air or oxidant, so as to maintain a minimum value of'ttox in the effluent gases. 2. the burning of fuels, however it is accomplished in burners, as they are known in the art of fuel burning, is productive of oxides of nitrogen (nox) in normal operation. such oxides of nitrogen as are produced in combination with olefinic hydrocarbons, which may be present in the atmosphere constitute a major source of smog. smog, while not necessarily lethal, is recognized universally as potentially damaging to animal tissue, consequently, several limitations on the nox content of stack gases ventedto the atmosphere as a result of fuel burning, have been imposed hy various governmental authorities and agencies the prior art is best represented by united states pntent o. 4,004,875. this patent has been the basis of a wide application of low nox burners in.the natural gas field, scores of burners, which are based on this patent, are in commercial service, where they have a suppressed nox as intended. however, the optimum operation of the prior paten1 has been for fixed rates of fuels burning, where a good balance can be provided between the primary and secondary air or oxidant supplies to a first combustion chamber and a suppl; of additional tertiary air or oxidant downstream of the first combustion chamber. the we.a]ne.si of the prior design is that for one condition of furnace draft or firing rate the operation is ideal. jiowever, when the firing rate changes significantly, such as from lo3 o to 8o7:j, as is typical of daily process heater firing, there is difficulty in maintaining nox suppression. the reason for this is that, at reduced firing rate, the furnace draft remains constant or approximately so and increased air-to-fuel ratios destroy the less-than- stoichiometric burning zone prior to tertiary air delivery, which results in less-than-optimum nox reduction plus higher than desirable excess air. what is required is a burner which provides means for correction for any condition of firing such as might be required when the furnace draft remains substantially constant, as changes in firing rates are made. if such corrections can be made, the result is continuation of nox suppression and maintenance of optimum excess air for high thermal efficiency. in the prior art burner there is no control of the tertiary air which is caused to flow by furnace draft, while the primary and secondary air also flow for the same reason. the total air flow will vary as the square root of the furnace draft. thus, only one rate of fuel burning or firing rate, at a condition of furnace draft, will provide the required excess air and lnox suppression. this would seem to indicate that control of the air flow
