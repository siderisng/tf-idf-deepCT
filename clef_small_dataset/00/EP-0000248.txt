<ABSTRACT>
a milling machine for milling a face of a metal work-piece  (34) has a cutter positioned to act on the face of a  workpiece (34) passed through the machine.  a control  means is employed to ensure that the depth of cut on the  face remains at its preset value regardless of variations in  thickness of the workpiece (34) entering the machine.  in a preferred arrangement, the machine has a pair of  cutters (2, 4) positioned to act on opposed faces of the work-piece  (34).  the control means then ensures that the depth of  cut on each face remains at its present value.
