<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to novel heterocyclic trich足 loromethyl derivatives, particularly 2-足 trichloromethyl-substituted quinazoline, benzo [d]-[1,3]足 -oxazine and benzo[e]-[1,3]-oxazine derivatives, for example  1,2-dihydro-2-trichloromethylquinazolin-4-one.  the com足 pounds of the invention are at least as effective as prior art  trichloromethyl derivatives, which reduce the production of  methane during the rumen metabolism of ruminant animals,  and increase the formation of propionate at the expense of  acetate, and hence improve the animals' rate of growth and  their efficiency of food utilisation.
