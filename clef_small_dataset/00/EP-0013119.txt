<ABSTRACT>
molding apparatus for injection-compression molding  thermosetting materials comprises an injection nozzle  assembly (17) controlled at a temperature high enough to  maintain thermosetting molding material within the nozzle in  a plasticized state and low enough that no substantial curing  or setting-up of the thermosetting molding material takes  place.  in the injection state, a movable platen assembly (39,41)  is positioned with its mold faces (27) in close proximity with  aligned mold faces (25) on a stationary platen assembly  (29,31) to form partially open mold cavities (23) into which  thermosetting molding material is fed in a plasticized state  lthrough the nozzle member (17), through runner channels  (21) from the nozzle assembly into the partially open, heated,  mold cavities (23).  subsequent complete closure of the heated mold cavities  cuts off further feed of thermosetting material by closing off  the runner channels with the thermosetting material within  the confines of the mold faces being pressed and heated to a  curing temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
description apparatus for runnerless injection-compression molding thermosetting materials the present invention relates to improved apparatus for injection molding thermosetting materials and, more particularly, to injection molding of thermosetting synthetic resin compositions. injection molding is an advantageous method of forming articles of synthetic resin. in general terms, injection molding is a process wherein the molding composition, in a melted or plasticized state, is injected into the mold cavity. typically, cold molding composition in granular form is fed from a hopper into a heated cylinder containing a screw. the molding composition is heated, melted and plasticized on the screw flights, and then the screw, acting as a ram, injects the melted and plasticized material into a mold cavity. in the case of thermosetting material, the molded material is cured in the mold by compaction and by heat added to the mold cavity. after curing, the article is ejected from the mold and the process repeated. injection molding offers the advantages of reduced molding cycles, better control of process variables, and increased productivity as compared with conventional compression and transfer molding processes. the major disadvantage with the injection molding of thermosetting materials is the generation of a considerable amount of waste material, particularly when multiple cavity systems are employed. the waste material is generated by thermosetting material that has cured, become infusible, in the runner and sprue systems and cannot be reused. the amount of non-reusable waste material generated in this fashion can be substantial, ranging tpici; ly from about 15 to about 80 percent of the total afiiount of material required to mold an article. a recent technical advance in the molding art has been the adaptation of the runnerless injection, or cold manifold, process to the injection molding of thermosetting resins. in the cold manifold process, the material in the sprue and manifold system is maintained at a temperature sufficient to maintain the material in a plasticized condition, without causing the material to prematurely cure of "set-up". thus, when a cured part s removed from the mold cavity, the material in the sprue and manifold becomes part of the next molding, instead of being discarded as in conventional injection molding operations. the runnerless injection process, therefore, provides for significant savings in material. the thermosetting materials usually employed in runnerless injection processes differ in some respects from materials normally employed in conventional injection processes because of the different requirements of each process. one significant difference is that a runnerless injection material is adapted to remain in a plasticized or fused condition in the feed system for extended periods of time without prematurely curing, usually at temperatures between about 104 and about 116 c. (220 to 240 f.) while also being capable of rapidly curing in the mold cavity at the molding temperature, usually about 1700c. (340of.). although such formulations are useful in the present invention, they are not required, and the molding compositions presently utilized may be selected from the more economical and more readily available standard thermosetting molding compositions. an example
