<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for sorting capsule components is  described, which consists of assembled capsules (13) from  unassembled capsule bodies and caps characterized by a  conveyor plate (16) positioned to receive the capsule compo足 nents, a vibratory drive (18) coupled to said conveyor plate  (16) for effecting progressive movement of said capsule com足 ponents along said conveyor plate (16) toward an exit chute  (27), said conveyor plate (16) having a plurality of circular  holes with a diameter greater than the diameter of the capsule  caps and less than the length of an assembled capsule (13), an  upper plate (21) spaced above said conveyor at a distance less  than said cap length and greater than said cap diameter, said  upper plate (21) having a plurality of circular holes in coaxial  alignment with the holes in said conveyor plate (16) and hav足 ing a diameter slightly greater than the length of an assem足 bled capsule (13), said conveyor plate (16) and said upper  plate (21) cooperating to permit passage of only said caps and  said bodies through the holes in said conveyor plate (16).
