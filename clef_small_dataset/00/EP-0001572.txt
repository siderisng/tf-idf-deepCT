<ABSTRACT>
1.  a self-locking bolt or nut of which the annular contact surface comprises an inner part (1) extending at right angles to its axis (7) and an outer, shallow-conical part (9) contiguous to, extending radially outward from, and concentrically surrounding said inner part, the apex (10) of the cone defining said outer part being directed towards the cooperating surface of the work-piece and the envelope surface of sais inner part (6) being formed by the crests (5) of a plurality of locking teeth (4) which extend substantially radially in the manner of a radial crown, are of rib-shaped cross-section and are, especially during loosening, arranged to make cutting engagement into the opposing surface of the workpiece, characterised in that the crests (5) of the locking teeth extend uninterruptedly over the outer part (9) of the contact surface in such a manner that the shallow-conical shape thereof, known per se, is formed by the common envelope surface of the crests (5) of the locking teeth.
