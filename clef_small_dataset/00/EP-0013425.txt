<ABSTRACT>
a hydro-mechanical change speed mechanism of the  type useful in road sweeping vehicles and the like in which the  vehicle is required to travel from place to place at normal road  speed but also requires the ability to travel at a relatively  reduced speed whilst carrying out its main function such as  road sweeping.  the change speed mechanism herein dis­ closed is inserted into the normal drive train so that the input  shaft (11) for the mechanism mates with the output shaft from  a vehicle gear box and the output drive shaft from the  mechanism (12) drives the driven wheels of the vehicle via a  cardan shaft.  a selector mechanism (41, 42, 43) enables the  input and output shafts (11 and 12) to be mechanically directly  connected together, or via respective first and second gear  trains (15 and 16), to a vehicle drive pump (13) and a hydraulic  motor (17) respectively.  a hydraulic connection between the  vehicle pump (13) and the hydraulic motor (17) results in an  alternative hydraulic coupling between the input and output  shafts (11 and 12).  the first and second gear trains (15 and 16)  are displaced to either side of a central longitudinal plane  including the axes of the input and output shafts (11 and 12) so  that the vehicle drive pump (13) and the hydraulic motor (17)  can be accommodated in a place saving arrangement along­ side one another.  further drives (14, 30) are available for  auxiliary equipment.  the arrangement also features a novel  housing arrangement and novel selector mechanism.
