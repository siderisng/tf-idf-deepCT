<ABSTRACT>
a method of fabricating a field effect transistor comprising  the steps of forming an active layer (3) of semiconductor  material, eg gaas over the surface of a first substrate (1) of  semiconductor material, eg also gaas, forming source, drain  (6,7) and gate (10) electrodes over the surface of the active  layer, applying a second substrate (11) of insulating material  to the surface of this structure and removing the first  substrate.  to facilitate the removal of the gaas first substrate  by selective etching, a buffer layer (2) of gaa1as resistant to  the gaas etchant may be formed between the first substrate  and active layer, which buffer layer is removed, following  removal of the first substrate, using a selective etchant to  which the gaas active layer is resistant.  a second gate  electrode may be formed on the active layer following  removal of the first substrate.  the technique is particularly  applicable to high frequency fet devices.
