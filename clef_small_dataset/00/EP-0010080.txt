<ABSTRACT>
in a pneumatically powered grinding machine pro­ vided with a flyweight operated speed governor there is  incorporated an independently operating overspeed safety  device which in case of malfunction of the speed governor  is intended to obstruct further motive air supply to the  motor of the machine.  the overspeed safety device com­ prises an annular valve disc (40) having two centrifugal  weights (41) which together with a suspender plate (43)  form a latch means by which the valve disc (40) is kept in  open position at motor speeds not exceeding a predeter­ mined level.  in its open position, the valve disc (40) is elas­ tically bent about a diameter line as a result of the latch  engagement between the centrifugal weights (41) and the  suspender plate.  when the predetermined speed limit is  reached, the valve disc (40) is released from the suspender  plate to occupy, while resuming its original flat shape, an  air supply obstructing, closed position.  the safety device is  not resettable without dismantling the machine.
