<ABSTRACT>
a signal path (from a to c) includes, as dc connected  series elements, the base-emitter path of a pnp input emitter足 follower transistor (40) and the base-emitter path of an npn  output emitter-follower transistor (50).  the junction of the  series elements is connected by the collector-emitter path of  an npn switching transistor (60) to a reference potential point  (ground) and by a resistor (51) to a positive dc supply termi足 nal.  with the switching transistor cut off, the emitter-followers  (40, 50) are biased into conduction to enable the signal path.   with the switching transistor (60) rendered conducting under  control of a switching signal (sw) the base-emitter paths of  both emitter-followers are reverse biased with resultant dis足 abling of the signal path.  in a dual standard color tv receiver,  a pair of such signal paths are subject to complementary  control of respective switching transistors (120, 130) to effect  alternation of the operating mode of the receiver between a  secam-reception mode in which the secam chrominance  component is transcoded into a quasi-pal format and applied  to the input terminal (a) of one (30, 40, 50) of the paths, and a  pal-reception mode in which the pal chrominance compo足 nent is supplied to the input terminal (b) of the other path (90,  100), the common output terminal (c) of the two paths leading  to a pal decoder operative for either mode.
