<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a process for the preparation of  formic acid by hydrolyzing methyl formate with water at high  temperature and pressure in the presence of a formic acid  catalyst.  methanol is also formed.  the reesterification of the  reaction products to methyl formate (a reaction favored by  high temperatures) is minimized by flashing the reaction  product at relatively low pressure and temperature and  thereafter distilling the residual liquid.  thus procedure  separates the methyl alcohol from the formic acid with a  minimum contact time and at a low temperature which does  not favor the reesterification reaction.  high purity formic acid  may be obtained by subjecting the bottom from the vacuum  distillation of further distillation.  in a preferred embodiment of the invention, prior to the  main hydrolysis, the methyl formate is partially hydrolyzed  to form the small amount of formic acid needed to accelerate  the main hydrolysis step.  accordingly, the necessary formic  acid catalyst is formed in situ, thus eliminating the need to  add formic acid or to recycle product formic acid.
