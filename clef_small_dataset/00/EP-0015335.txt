<ABSTRACT>
a method of making additions of large dense particles  such as lead to a bath of molten metal by accelerating the  particles to a velocity of not less than 2200 cm per second.   the particles can be introduced through a lance or through  a port in a vessel containing the bath or by projection  through the metal/slag/air interface.  the particles are pre­ ferably introduced by means of a lance (11) having a re­ servoir (13) at one end containing the particles and to  which gas under pressure is fed.  the lance contains an  accelerating means comprising a first passage part (51)  and a second, diverging, passage part (52) and four in­ clined passages (53) extending to the throat between the  parts (51) and (52) and through which is fed further gas  under pressure which expands in the second passage part  (52) and accelerates the particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: method of and apparatus for making additions of particles to molten metal. description of invention this invention relates to a method of, and apparatusfor, making additions of particles to a bath of molten metal. the invention is particularly concerned with making additions of large dense particles as herein defined. by large dense particles, we mean particles having a maximum dimension of not less than 0.25 mm and a density of not less than 4.5 gm/cc. examples of such particles include lead shot, ferroboron, bismuth/lead alloy, calcium/barium alloy, ferroselenium, copper telluride, ferrochrome, ferromanganese. these particles may be produced by grinding or gas atomisation, casting or other means. hitherto many proposals have been put forward for introducing, for example, lead into a bath of molten steel, see for example u.k.patent specifications nos. 519 572; 520 024; 520 072; 520 227 which disclose the addition of lead shot to a stream of molten metal as it is being teemed from a ladle into ingotxmoulds. with such known techniques it has not been possible to achieve both good recovery of the added lead together with a substantially uniform distribution of the lead in fine particles throughout the ingots. it-is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a method of, and apparatus for, making additions, particularly but not exclusively of particles such as lead shot, to a bath of molten metal in such a manner as to achieve good retention of the addition in the metal whilst ensuring that so far as possible the addition is present in the metal in the form of uniformly distributed fine particles. this is achieved in accordance with one aspect of the invention by providing a method of making an addition to a bath of molten metal comprising the steps of accelerating large dense particles of addition material to a velocity of not less than 2200 cm/sec and directing the thus accelerated stream of particles into the bath. preferably the particles are accelerated to a velocity lying in the range 2750 cm/s' ec to 3650 cm/sec. the particles may be accelerated by a fluid medium. additions may be introduced into the bath at a speed greater than that at which the accompanying fluid is introduced into the bath. the addition and fluid may be introduced through a nozzle of a lance immersed in the bath or a nozzle of a port provided in a wall of a vessel in which the bath is contained. alternatively the particulate material may be accelerated im an accelerating means located above the molten bath, the particulate material being projected into the bath through the metal surface which may be slag covered. when a lance or port is provided the particulate material may be accelerated within the lance or port by a gas to such a velocity that the particles pass through the bubbles of the gas formed in the bath. if the particles did not pass through the bubbles the particulate material may zither ejected from the surface of the bath
