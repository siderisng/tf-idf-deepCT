<ABSTRACT>
manufacture articles in the form of sheets coated with  a composition consisting of:   a) from 75 to 99 parts by weight of a polypropylenic  material of melt index comprised between 5 and 60, con­ sisting of a prevailingly isotactic polymer of propylene;   b) from 1 to 25 parts b. w.  of polyethylene having a  density comprising between 0. 910 and 0. 935, having a melt  index comprised between 1 and 10, or of an ethylene-­ propylene copolymer of the amorphous type, having a melt  index comprised between 1 and 50;   c) from 0. 01 to 0. 2 parts b. w.  on 100 parts of polyme­ ric composition of an organic sulphide of formula: a-s-b  wherein a and b, equal to or different from each other, are  aryl, alkyl, alkylaryl groups, at least one of the groups a  and b being an aryl containing a functional hydroxyl group  in position 2 or 4 with respect to s, and at least one linear  or branched alkyl group.

<DESCRIPTION>
des crip t ion of an invention having for a title: "manufactured articles coated with olefinic polymers and process for their preparation., the present invention concerns manufactured articles in the form of sheets coated with olefinic polymers, and the process for their preparation. more particularly, the invention relates to the coating of paper, aluminum, fabrics of either fibrilled or unfibrilled polyolefinic fabrics and the like, with the polyolefini com positions object of this invention. in previous patents in the name of the same applicant as well as of others, there have been described processes that consist in coating supports, essentially consisting of polyolefine films, with polyolefinic compositions, in order to make the films thermoweldable and impermeable. the coating of paper, aluminum, fabrics of fibrilledor unfibriled polyolefinic film and the like, with mixtures of polyolefines, is however, quite difficult. as a matter of fact, if the coating of different supports by means of the extrusion-coating technique, is carried out using as a coating polyolefinic mixtures, the process is disturbed by irregularities in the flow of the molten coating material, irregularities that influence negatively the final characteristics of the product and considerably reduce the winding up speed of coated manufactured articles obtained as a continuous sheet. we have now found, and this forms the object of this invention, that it is possible to obtain manufactured articles in the form of sheets, consisting of paper, aluminum, fabrics of polyolefinic films, either fibrilled or un fibrilled, and the like, coated with mixtures of polyolefines, by a process in which the previously described drawbacks do not occur. operating according to the extrusion coating tech nique according to this invention, the flow of the molten coating material is regular, the windinp speed of the ma nufactured articles is rather high while the articles them selves display such characteristics as to be suited for use in numerous fields of use. the supports used according to this invention consist of paper of the kraft type, imitation parchment (parchment pa per), glassine and the like, aluminum foils, also coupled with other different materials such as for instance paper and plastic films, fabrics made of polyolefinic films, ei thet fibrilled or unfibrilled, obtained by either flat or tubular film extruding of polyolefines or mixtures thereof, possibly additioned with stabilizers, dyeing pigments, either organic or inorganic, lubricants, opacizers, antistatic agents and the likes. the film-forming is followed by longitudinal drawing and cutting of the film by known methods. the coatings according to this invention are obtained by using a composition consisting of: a) a prevailingly isotactic propylene polymer or a propylene -ethylene copolymer.of the "random" type, crystalline and containing up to 6% by weight of ethylene, or polymer mixtures containing prevailingly isotactic polypropylene by obtained/polymerization in at least two stages, with ste reospecific catalysts, of propylene and subsequently of ethy lene'and/or of an ethylene-propylene mixture, so as to ob tain a polymerization product containing up to 20% b.w. of methylene. in any case, the polyolefinic material has a melt index comprised
