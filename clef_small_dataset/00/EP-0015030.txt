<ABSTRACT>
skin conditioning compositions, especially compositions for the care of the face, comprising an emulsion which is about 8 to 25% of skin moisturizing ingredients of which about 2. 5 to 8% is a sterol, about 10 to 35% is a sugar or a hydroxy alcohol and 5 to 15% is lanolin fatty acids.  an emulsifier is also present as a skin moisturizing ingredient.  other oily, moisturizing materials may make up the remainder of the moisturizing fraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
skin conditioning compositions the present invention is related to skin conditioning compositions which possess a unique combination of moisturizing materials. the moisturizing combination provides excellent skin conditioning benefits while also being very easy to rub in (i.e. very spreadable and quick to rub in) and not leaving an undesirable greasy residue on the skin. the treatment of human skin with various agents has been undertaken for many years with the goal being to keep the skin in a smooth and supple condition. skin has the tendency to dry out when extended periods of exposure to the elements and cleaning solutions are encounterea. from a biochemical standpoint, dryness is a measure of the water content of the skin. under normal conditions, the water content and vapor pressure of the epidermis are higher than those of the surrounding air with consequent evaporation of water from the skin surface. skin becomes dry because of excessive loss of water from the surface and the subsequent loss of water from the stratum corneum. the facial areas present special problems in addition to those present with, for instance, the hands. some facial areas, due to high concentrations of sebaceous and sweat glands, often feel greasy to a person. other facial areas do not feel this way and may feel overly dry. the facial areas are also subject to wrinkling which causes difficulty in achieving good distribution of facial compos,tions. all of these problems require that special care be taken in formulating a product which is to be used on the face as well as other body areas. background art to alleviate the aforementioned conditions, emollient creams as described in sagarin, cosmetics science and technology, 2nd edition, vol. 1, wiley interscience (1972) have been recommended for application to the skin. the emollient materials probably increase the state of hydration of the corneous layer of the skin by altering the rate of diffusion of water from the lower epidermal and dermal layers, the rate of evaporation of water from the skin's surface, and the ability of the corneous layer to hold moisture. the use or three of tine essential moisturizing components of the present compositions, lanolin fatty acids, sterols and a hydroxy alcohol or a sugar, has been disclosed in the art but not in the critical amounts found to be essential in the present invention. u.s. patent 3,957,971, may 18, 1976 to oleniazz discloses liposomes comprising lecithin, dicetyl phosphate, a sterol and an aqueous solution of a humectant. u.s. patent 3,818,105, june 18, 1974 to coppersmith et al discloses compositions containing isoparaffinic hydrocarbons and other cosmetic additives such as lanolin and a humectant such as propylene glycol. u.s. patent re. 29,814, october 24, 1978 to w. e. snyder discloses compositions containing lanolin fatty acids, silicone, lanolin derivatives and sorbitol. cholesterol in a variety of compositions is disclosed in drug and cosmetic industry, vol. 74, pp. 52, 53, 127 - 137 (1954). disclosure of the invention the present invention relates to superior skin conditioning compositions comprising an emulsion
