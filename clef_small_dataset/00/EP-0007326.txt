<ABSTRACT>
amidine phosphonate compounds have the structure    in which het is a 5- or 6- membered unsaturated nitrogen  heterocycle, z is sulphur or methylene, n is 2 or 3, r¹ is  hydrogen, lower alkyl or het-ch₂z(ch₂)n₂-, p is 0 or 1, r² is  hydrogen or lower alkyl, or r¹ and r² together form a (ch₂)₂  or (ch₂)₃ group, r³ is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl-(lower alkyl), and  r⁴ is hydrogen when p is 0 and hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl or  aryl (lower alkyl) when p is 1.  those compounds where r⁴ is  other than hydrogen are intermediates for the preparation of  the compounds where r⁴ is hydrogen, which have histamine  h₂-antagonist activity and are the active ingredients of phar­ maceutical compositions.  the compounds are prepared by  primary amine coupling reactions, phosphonylation and hyd­ rolysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to amidine compounds, their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. many physiologically-active substances elicit their biological actions by interaction with specific sites known as receptors. histamine is such a substance and has a number of biological actions. those biological actions of histamine which are inhibited by drugs commonly called "antihistamines", of which mepyramine, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine are typical examples, are mediated through histamine h1-receptors. however, others of the biological actions of histamine are not inhibited by "antihistamines" and actions of this type which are inhibited by burimamide are mediated through receptors which are termed histamine h2-receptors, and which may be defined as those histamine receptors which are not blocked by mepyramine but are blocked by burimamide. compounds which block histamine h2-receptors are referred to as histamine h2-antagonists. blockade of histamine h2-receptors is of utility in inhibiting the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by "antihistamines". histamine h2-antagonists are therefore useful, for example, as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, as anti-inflammatory agents and as agents which act on the cardiovascular system, for example as inhibitors of the effects of histamine on blood pressure. the present invention provides an amidine phosphonate compound of structure 1: emi1.1 structure 1 in which het is a 5- or 6- membered fully unsaturated heterocycle containing at least one nitrogen atom and optionally substituted by lower alkyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxymethyl, halogen, hydroxy or lower alkoxy; z is sulphur or methylene; n is 2 or 3; r1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or het-ch2z(ch2)n-; p is 0 or 1; r2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; or r1 and r2 together form a (ch2)2 or (ch2)3 group; 3 r3 is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl(lower alkyl); and r4 is hydrogen when p is 0 and hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl or -aryl(lower alkyl) when p is 1. the above compounds where r4 is hydrogen, which are phosphonic acid mono-esters, are -the first phosphorus compounds to be discovered to be histamine h2-antagonists, and the remaining compounds, namely those where p is 1 and 4 r is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl(lower alkyl), which are phosphonic acid diesters, are useful as intermediates for conversion by hydrolysis to the histamine h2-antagonists where p is 1 and r is hydrogen. structure 1 is representative'of the tautomeric forms in which the compounds can exist. the compounds where r4 is hydrogen (the moso-esters) have both basic and acidic character and can be prepared in the form of their acid addition salts or their salts with bases such as sodium hydroxide as well as in zwitterionic form. the compounds where r is not hydrogen (the di-esters) have basic character and can be prepared in the form of their acid addition salts. the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and salts with bases are particularly concerned. in this specification by 'lower alkyl' and 'lower alkoxy' are meant an alkyl or alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms: it can be straight or branched. an aryl group is preferably phonyl. examples of heterocycles of the
