<ABSTRACT>
according to types or composition, assorted bottles (9), preferably empty bottles, are conveyed separately and inserted separately into crates (19).  for this purpose a single packing machine (7, 7a) is provided which puts the seized bottles (9), in each case on a hook-like trajectory (16), into the crates (19).  each type of bottle is provided with its own bottle-accumulation table (8a to 8d).  for average efficiency, in each case for two or more accumulation tables (8a to 8d) only one bottle-gripping head (18, fig.  1), which can be called away from accumulation table to accumulation table and is horizontally movable, is provided.  for greater efficiency, each accumulation table (8a to 8d) is allocated its own gripping head (18), the gripper (11) of which can be raised up to about 15 cm relative to its gripping head (fig.  10).  in this way it is not possible for bottle-accumulation tables (8b, 8c, fig.  10) which are not yet fully occupied to hinder the immediate packing procedure for bottles (9) of fully occupied bottle-accumulation tables (8a, 8d).  the crates (19) packed with uniform bottles (9) can then be palleted separately according to types and stocked until further use.  <image>
