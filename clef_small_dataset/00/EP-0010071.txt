<DESCRIPTION>
an apparatus for the automatic determination in percentage of the volume of particles in suspension in a liquid. the present invention relates to apparatuses for the automatic determination of the percentage of the volume of particles in suspension in a liquid. more specifically the apparatus of the present invention relates to a determination and/or a measure and/or . detection of homogenous groupings in a determined fi eld of particles in suspension in a liquid. a very specific and convenient application of the apparatus of ti present invention is in the volumetric determination of blood corpuscles which are in an aqueos suspension with addlti ves and more specifically of the red corpuscles. it is well know for instance, that in the specific case of blood diagnosis, the laboratories which are equipped to make such determinations, have available some apparatuses which are capable of measuring predetermined parameters of red cor puscles which are placed in aqueos solution in a small contai ner containing a suitable additive. these parameters essentially consist of the following: - a numerical calculation with reference to a predetermi@ed unit of volume, for instance mm3, that is the number of red corpuscles in a specified volume; - the average volume of the corpuscles which have been cai- lated, that is the volume obtained from the sum of the volu mes of the small corpuscles, that is'the corpuscles which ha ve been computed divided by the number of the corpuscles whi ch have been computed. this is the arithmetical average. - the total volume of the corpuscles in percentage of the to tal volume of the blood being analyzed. the device which is ordinarily used for this determination is the hematocrit. these results or parameters are essentially obtained with two types of apparatuses: - the first type is an apparatus functioning electrostatical ly, which utilizes a laser beam and which measures the diffu sion of light at a fixed angle of 15 - 30 , which apparatus converts the optical signal based on the source of light into an electronic impulse which has a definite duration and a de finite amplitude, the latter being the height of the signal on a screen, so that this amplitude results proportional to the volume of every blood corpuscle being analyzed. - the second type consists of an electrical apparatus which determines variations in the electrical resistance or capaci ty due to the passage of the same corpuscles in an aqueous suspension. also in this apparatus these variations of resis tance and/or capacity cause electric signals to be emanated, which signals are characterized by an amplitude and a durati on as with the preceding type of apparatuses. all these types of apparatuses present the drawback that they do not give accurate results, particulary in the case when im purities are present in the environment and when impurities are present in the solution which are computed as if they we re corpuscles. a further drawback of the well know apparatuses resides in the fact that
