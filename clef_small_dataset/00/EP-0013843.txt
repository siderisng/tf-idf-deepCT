<ABSTRACT>
1.  intensity detector for a regulation setting up in relation to the total power demand used by an assembly of electro-domestic devices comprising the following units : - a circuit made of 2 conducting rods (1, 2) crossed by the total current and set up in series through a conducting element (3, 4) which forms a heating element, - a first thermistance (ntc 1) placed close to the heating element, - a second thermistance (ntc 2) the two thermistances being set up in series between a point of the circuit crossed by the total current upstream the heating element and another point with a different potential of that of the conducting rods, - a regulation signal being completed at the connecting point of the two thermistances, being distinguished by the fact that : - the heating element (3, 4) and the first thermistance (ntc 1) are wrapped in a block (8) of solid material, electrically insulating and having a thermic inertia slightly higher than that of the heating element, - the second thermistance is located outside the block of solid material and close to it, - the dimensioning of the distances between said units and of the thermic inertia of said units are such that the regulation signal is a picture of the average of the intensity of the total currents with integration of steady variations of said total current, over a period of 5 to 20 seconds, while following sudden increases of that total current within a response time of about 5 seconds.
