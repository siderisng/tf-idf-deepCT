<ABSTRACT>
a ribbon cartridge (12, 14) for use in a printer, for example  a serial impact printer, includes flexible leaders (18, 26) for  guiding the ribbon (16) from a stationary storage position or  area (10) to a movable print point (22).  in order to place  tension on the ribbon (16) which is stored in the cartridge (12,  14), preferably in a stuffed condition, a removable clip (32) is  provided having a cooperating finger (34) and convex surface  (36).  the ribbon is thus pinched so as to produce a drag force  on the ribbon (16) at a location (30) which is adjacent the print  point (22) and spaced from the cartridge (12,14) by a substanÂ­ tial length of the flexible leader (18).
