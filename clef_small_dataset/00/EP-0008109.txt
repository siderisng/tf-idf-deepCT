<ABSTRACT>
the aerosol container and valve system are espe­ cially intended for use with compositions containing li­ quefied flammable propellants, the valve system having a  delivery valve that is capable of delivering a spray that is  either flameless or at worst has an abnormally low flame  extension, whether the container is in an upright position  or in a fully inverted position.  manupulation of the deli­ very valve (4) opens and chloses a passage to flow of  aerosol composition and propellant from the storage  compartment (21) to a mixing chamber (35) and the de­ livery port (14).  at least two flow constrictions (33, 13a)  are disposed across the passage in the line of flow from  the mixing chamber (35) to the delivery port (14), each  constriction having an open area within the range from  about 0. 05 to about 0. 4 mm², and at least two expansion  chambers (5, 13), one following each constriction, each  having an open area at least 25% greather than that of  the preceding constriction, thereby reducing the flam­ mability of the delivered spray.
