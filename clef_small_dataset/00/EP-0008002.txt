<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to electronic circuit package  and method of testing such package, and deals with the  testing of a network of electrical interconnections between  chips (20) mounted on an insulating substrate (10) of a  circuit module and between the chips and the input and  output pins of the module.  each of the mounted chips (20)  contains masking circuits which can be activated to prevent  signals from the outputs of logic circuits on the chip from  being transmitted off the chip and into the interconnection  network (11).  also each of the chips (20) contains emitter  follower circuits (40) that logically connect all the chip in­ put terminals to a common output terminal (23) of the  chip.  in testing, the mask circuits are activated.  then poten­ tial levels are selectively applied to a plurality of test points  in the interconnection network and differences in potential  level between these test points and/or between the points  and one or more of the common terminals are determined.
