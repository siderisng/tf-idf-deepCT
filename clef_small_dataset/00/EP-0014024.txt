<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus is designed to support two rotary slide  tray (26, 44) disposed one above the other.  means (38,  40) is provided for indexing the lower tray (26) and a  coupling member (46) extends between the two trays so  that the upper tray (44) is indexed in synchronism with the  lower tray (26).  a chute (52) is provided for conveying  slides from the upper tray (44) to the lower tray (26) and  is shaped to turn the slides laterally so that they enter the  second tray (26) in reverse orientation compared with their  former orientation in the first tray (44).  in one embodiment,  a "carousel"-type slide projector provides the means for  indexing the trays.  in another embodiment, a slide reverÂ­ sing apparatus having built-in indexing means is disclosed.
