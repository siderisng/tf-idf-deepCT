<ABSTRACT>
Method for obtaining polyalcohols such as xylene of deciduous woods or one-year plants by finally with diluted mineral acids at higher Tempe ratures in which a sugar solution is formed, which is deionized and decolorized in an ion exchanger and then hydrogenated to a polyalcohol solution that is hydrogenated in front of the Gewin the pure polyalcohols by crystallization just if it is deionized by means of an ion exchanger and is dyed, wherein the sugar solution is not particularly neutralized after the digestion and the decolorization and deionization of both the sugar solution and the poly alcohol solution in the same ion exchanger system are performed by filling the regenerating ion replacement system only with polyalcohol solution, wherein the entire acetic acid contained therein is bound, then charged with the sugar solution at the opening, whereby the acetic acid contained in the sugar solution n Polyalcohol solution is displaced with the sugar solution and the system is washed and regenerated after the sugar cycle with water. The sugar solution obtained from the ion exchanger is concentrated over the conventional concentration for hydrogenation, wherein the main amount of acetic acid is separated away, and then diluted with wash water to a concentration suitable for the hy.
