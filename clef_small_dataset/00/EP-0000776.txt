<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adhesive improved in the water vapor receiving capability and permeability on the basis of at least one organic, water-insoluble binder and optionally an organic solvent and / or water. These adhesives contain an addition of at least one small parts, hydrophilic, swellable, modified polymers. These swellable, modified polymers are, in particular, at least about 50 wt. -% water-insoluble; You can prefer to count swellable, modified carbohydrate derivatives, as with the aid of heat energy, radiation or by an additional chemical compound networked starkrodic cellulose ether. In a method for producing such adhesives, the adhesive base is added to the particles from at least one swellable, modified polymer prior to their processing and evenly distributed therein, and the mixture is then elapsed or otherwise deformed. The adhesives according to the invention are particularly suitable for bonding flat materials in the production and processing of coated textiles and natural and synthetic leather.
