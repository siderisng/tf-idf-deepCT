<ABSTRACT>
a bus connection system in which a central processing  unit (14) is connected to each of a plurality of buses (20, 21) via  respective drivers (15, 17) and receivers (16, 18).  peripheral  circuits (22 to 25) are connected each to one only of the buses  (20, 21).  data can be passed between the central processing  unit (14) and a peripheral circuit (22 to 25) via the appropriate  bus by control of the drivers and receivers (15 to 18) by control  signals (c, d, e, f) from the central processing unit (14).  the central processing unit (14) and the peripheral cirÂ­ cuits are mounted on respective printed circuit boards (19, 22  to 25) and a back panel (26) carrying all of the buses (20, 21)  connects the printed circuit boards.
