<ABSTRACT>
a method of recovering metal values selected from gold,  silver, copper and nickel from an activated carbon support  having one or more of these values adsorbed thereon in the  form of an alkaline earth metal ionic complex, the metal value  forming part of the anionic portion thereof, including the  steps of contacting the support with a pre-treatment reagent,  followed by desorbing the metal values from the support with  water having a low concentration of metal cations such as  deionised water, the method being characterised by the preÂ­ treatment reagent which is a mixture of an organic solvent  such as an alcohol or a ketone and an alkali metal cyanide or  hydroxide solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of recovering metal values this invention relates to metal value recovery, in particular to the recovery of gold, silver, nickel or copper metal values from solution. a method of recovering the above metals from supports on which they are adsorbed as complexes is covered by u.s. patent no 3,970,737. according to this method, the metal values are desorbed after pretreatment by contacting the support with water of low metal cation concentration. the water preferably has a low-multi-charged cation (e.g. alkaline earth metal cation) concentration. concentrations less than 300 ppm, preferably less than 100 ppm, are preferred. in other words the water is relatively pure and has a low ionic strength. suitable waters are for example distilled, deionised and otherwise softened waters. the above method has particular application to metal values in the form of cyanide ionic complexes, the metal value forming the anionic portion of the complex. any suitable adsorbent support may be used, carbon, particularly activated carbon, being preferred. it is also disclosed that when the cation associated with the complex is an alkaline earth metal, the complex is adsorbed on to the support very much more strongly than when the cation is an alkali metal, particularly when the complex is a gold cyanide one. accordingly, if the cation of the complex is an alkaline earth metal, particularly calcium, the support is preferably pre-treated with an alkali metal salt solution pricr to water desorption. our s.a patent no 76/4204 describes and claims an improved pre-treatment solution selected from the group of an alkali metal cyanide solution, an alkali metal hydroxide solution and a mixture thereof. according to the present invention, a pre-treatment reagent for an elution process as described above comprises a mixture of an organic solvent and an alkali metal salt and/or hydroxide solution. thus, the invention provides a method of recovering metal values selected from gold, silver, copper and nick21 from a carbon support having one or more of these values adsorbed thereon in the form of an alkaline earth metal ionic complex, the metal value forming part of the anionic portion thereof, including the steps of contacting the support with a pre-treatment reagent, followed by desorbing the metal values from the support with water having a low concentration of metal cations characterised in that the pre-treatment reagent is a mixture of: (a) an organic solvent, and (b) a solution selected from the group of an alkali metal cyanide solution, an alkali metal hydroxide solution and a mixture thereof. the organic solvent may be an alcohol such as isopropyl alcohol or a ketone such as acetone. generally, the organic solvent will be present in an amount of from 1 to 10, typically 5, percent by volume of the pre-treatment reagent. an exampl f of a suitable solution for the reagent is one containing an alkali metal 'cyanide concentration in the range 1 to 10 percent by weight and an alkali metal hydroxide concentration in the range 0,1 to 20 percent by weight. an example of another
