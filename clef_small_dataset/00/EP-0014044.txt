<ABSTRACT>
undesired oscillations in a communications confe­ rencing network are reduced and/or eliminated by fre­ quency shifting signals passing through the conferencing  network by a small amount for each pass therethrough.  electrical information signals from a plurality of indi­ vidual communication sets (s1, s2. . . sn) are individually  summed, frequency shifted by a predetermined amount,  and coupled back to individual ones of the communica­ tions sets (s1, s2. . . sn), less their individual signal contri­ butions.  frequency shifting can be performed on analog  electrical information signals by means (45) for modulating  the sum signals, means (48) for filtering the modulated sig­ nals, means (50) for remodulating the filtered signals with  a second carrier signal train having a frequency which dif­ fers from the frequency of the first carrier signal train by a  predetermined amount, and means (54) for filtering the sig­ nals resulting from the second modulating step.  frequency shifting on digital information signals is  performed by means (101) for digitally expanding the spec­ tral range of the sum signals to provide a plurality of repli­ cas of the spectral content of the signals distributed over a  wide spectral range, means (102) for digitally filtering the  expanded signals to filter out predetermined portions of the  expanded range, means (103) for digitally shifting the fre­ quency of the remaining replicas by a second expansion,  and means (104) for digitally filtering the frequency shifted  replicas to filter out unwanted portions of the shifted spec­ trum.
