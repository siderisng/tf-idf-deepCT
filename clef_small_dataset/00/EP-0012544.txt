<ABSTRACT>
a two-stage liquid ring pump (10) comprises a suction  end casing (12), a first stage body portion (14), first and se­ cond stage centre plates (16) and (18), second stage body  portion (20) and discharge end casing (22), these parts being  clamped together by bolts (32).  end bearing housings (40,42)  journal a shaft (48) which is eccentrically mounted with res­ pect to the cylindrical first and second stage pumping cham­ bers (54) and (56) and carries first and second stage impel­ lers (58) and (60).  a suction inlet (24) directs fluid into a suc­ tion manifold which connects with suction ports located at  both ends of the first stage pumping chamber (54) and the  first stage impeller (58) discharges this fluid under pressure  from first stage discharge ports such as (72) into discharge  manifold (28) which directs the fluid into section stage suc­ tion ports such as (80) located at both ends of the second  stage pumping chamber (56).  the second stage impeller (60)  drives the fluid admitted to second stage pumping chamber  (56) through discharge ports such as (88) into discharge ple­ num (86) and thence to discharge outlet (30).  for the purpose  of reducing noise and vibration in the pump whilst maintain­ ing ease of manufacture of the impellers, the impellers each  are formed with a prime number of equally spaced blades  and, to appreciably reduce peak noise levels, the two impel­ lers (58) and (60) have different numbers of blades.

<DESCRIPTION>
"liquid ring pump" this invention concerns improvements in or relating to liquid ring pumps which have been widely used, inter alia, in applications where smooth, non-pulsating gas or vapor removal is desired. known designs of liquid ring pumps are shown for example in united states of america patents nos. 2 940 657 and 3 221 659 issued to h. e. adams; 3 209 987 issued to i. c. jennings; and 3 846 o46 issued to kenneth w. roe and others, and these have achieved a significant measure of success. in our british patent application no. 14912/77 (belgian patent no. 853376 ) there is disclosed an advantageous design of liquid ring pump one of the principal features of which is the provision of a prime number of equally angularly spaced blades on the pump impeller for the purpose of reducing noise and vibration. in prior liquid ring pumps it was conventional to provide for example twelve equally spaced blades, and we were the first to appreciate that such an arrangement could give rise to vibrations at multiples and sub-multiples of the rotational blade excitation frequency of the impeller. by providing the impeller with a prime number of equally spaced blades, no sub-harmonic vibrations can be generated and a considerable reduction in noise and vibration is obtained. the object of the present invention is to enable yet a further appreciable reduction in noise and vibration to be obtained. as will become apparent from the following, the present invention resides in the concept of providing different prime numbers of baldes on the different impellers of the sequential or parallel arranged multiple stages of the liquid ring pumps embodying the invention of our previous application mentioned above. according to the present invention therefore there is provided an improved liquid ring pump for gases, liquids and mixtures thereof, comprising a casing defining at least two pump chambers; at least two impellers mounted each for rotation within one of said chambers of said casing, each said impeller having a prime number of radial blades supported thereon at equal angular intervals for pumping said fluids, said impellers having different numbers of blades, whereby the number of excitation frequencies of each said impeller and, hence, noise and vibration of said pump, are reduced and the different numbers of blades for the respective impellers cause different excitation frequencies for said impellers to further reduce vibration and noise of the pump, and at least one suction port and at least one exhaust port located adjacent each said impeller for each pump chamber. preferably, the numbers of said impeller blades for said at least two impellers are selected from the prime numbers 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19 it being preferred for a twoimpeller pump to have 13 blades on one impeller and 17 on the other. in the following, the invention will be explained by reference to embodiments which, other than having different prime numbers of blades on different impellers, are substantially identical to the embodiments described in our previous
