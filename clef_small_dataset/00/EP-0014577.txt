<ABSTRACT>
a meter, for example an electricity meter or a gas meter,  is provided with a variable resistance device 15 in such a way  that the electrical resistance of the device 15 is arranged to  vary in proportion to the reading registered by the indicator  mechanism 7 of the meter, the device 15 being connected in  an open electrical circuit 5a, 5b having a socket 4 located at a  position remote from the meter 6 for connecting into the  circuit means for measuring the resistance of the device 15.  in  this way the reading registered by the indicator mechanism 7  of the meter can be determined at the remote position of the  socket 4, which in the case of electricity and gas meters can be  located on the outside of the premises served by the meters.

<DESCRIPTION>
"meter with facility for remote reading" this invention relates to reading of meters at positions remote from the location of the meter, and is particularly concerned with the modification of electricity and gas meters so that they can be read from outside the premises on which they are located. in modern houses and other buildings served by electricity and gas it is common to install the meters, for example in cupboards which are built into an exterior wall of the building, so that they are accessible from outside the building to allow them to be read without the readers having .to enter the building. however, there are still many situations where this practice is either not f6llowed or not possible, and there are of course an enormous number of existing properties where the meters are installed inside so that it is necessary for readers to gain access to the premises in order to read the meters. this necessity is time consuming, often frustrating, and sometimes even annoying to the meter reader or the occupier, or both. furthermore, it is not unknown for this necessity to be used by persons posing as meter readers to gain access to premises for criminal purposes. consequently, any simple and inexpensive system which will obviate the need for readers to enter premises in order to read gas and electricity meters located on the premises should prove most attractive to everyone concerned. with this in mind, according to the present invention a meter having an indicator mechanism for indicating the value of the parameter which is measured byt'he meter is provided with a variable resistance which is arranged so that its resistance varies proportionally to the value registered by the indicating mechanism and which is.connected in an open electrical circuit having a position remote from the meter at which the circuit can be closed for the purpose of measuring the resistance of the variable resistance. provided the relationship between the variable resistance and the indicating mechanism of the meter is known, the value of the variable resistance as measured at the remote position enables the reading registered by the indicating mechanism to be determined. preferably the open circuit comprises a socket at the remote position for receiving the plug of an ohm meter for measuring the resistance of the circuit, and hence the resistance of the variable resistance. in this case the meter can be read simply by plugging a simple ohm meter, for example one of the digital electronic ohm meters which are now commonly available, into the socket, and directly reading the resistance indicated by the meter. provided the indicating mechanism of the meter and the variable resistance were zeroed at the time of installation, the ohm meter may, if desired, be calibrated to show directly the reading registered on the meter. in the case of electricity and gas meters installed insie a building, the remote reading socket may lye located at any suitable'outside location, for example in the lintel or frame of an

 claims   1. a meter having an indicator mechanism for indicating the value of the parameter which is measured by the meter, and in addition a variable resistance which is arranged so that its resistance varies proportionally to the value registered by the indicating mechanism and which is connected in an open electrical circuit having a position remote from the meter at which the circuit can be closed for the purpose of measuring the'resistance of the variable resistance.   2. a meter according to claim 1 which measures quantitatively the consumption of a commodity, and in which the indicator mechanism registers the cumulative amount of the commodity consumed.   3. a meter according to claim 2, in which the indicator mechanism comprises at least one dial having a pointer which is driven to indicate the measured value, and the variable resistance is varied by means which is driven by the part of the indicator mechanism which drives the pointer.   4. a meter according to claim 3, in which the indicator mechanism comprises a number of dials the pointers of which are driven at different rates from eachother by a gear chain, and the means which varies the variable resistance is driven by the shaft of the pointer of one of the dials.   5. a meter according to claim 3 or claim 4, in which the variable resistance comprises a resistance element the resistance of which changes substantially linearly along its length, and a movable contact which is moved along the resistance element by the turning of a screw in response to rotation of the pointer.     6. a meter according to any one of claims 2 to 5, which is an electricity meter.   7. a meter according to any   one of- claims    2 to 5, which is a gas meter.   8. a meter according to claim 6 or claim 7, in which the remote position at which the circuit can be closed to measure the resistance of the variable resistance is accessible from outside the premises on which the meter is located.    9. a meter according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the open circuit comprises a socket at the remote position for receiving the plug of an   ohm    meter for measuring the resistance of the circuit, and hence the resistance of the variable resistance.   10. a meter according to claim 8 or claim 9, in which one of the leads from the   variable    resistance device to the remote position is common to a secondary open circuit which has a substantially fixed electrical resistance which can be measured at the remote position.   11. a meter according to claim 10, in which there are two such secondary open circuits, one in which one of the leads of the primary open circuit is common, and one in which the other of the leads of the primary circuit is common.
