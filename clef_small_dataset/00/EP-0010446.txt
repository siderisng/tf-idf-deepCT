<ABSTRACT>
a track roller assembly for a crawler vehicle includes a  track roller frame (12) defining an elongate tunnel.  a pair of  spaced, elongate rails extend through the tunnel, and a stop  (26) is provided at one end of the tunnel.  a spring recoil  assembly (20) within the tunnel is in abutment with the stop  (26) and is supported by the rails.  the spring recoil assembly  (20) includes a housing (28) containing a compression spring  (30), and a movable plate (36) exposed through an opening  (32) in the housing remote from the stop and abutting the  spring to receive a reaction from the spring.  a hydraulic adjus­ ter assembly (22) is provided within the tunnel and is sup­ ported by the rails in abutment with, but not attached to, the  housing (28).  the adjuster assembly (22) includes a closed  hydraulic chamber with a movable piston (104) extending  therefrom and through the opening to abut the movable plate.   an idler yoke (24) within the tunnel and supported by the rails  abuts, but is not attached to, the adjuster assembly at its end  remote from the spring recoil assembly (20).
