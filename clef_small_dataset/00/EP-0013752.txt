<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for the production of particulate polyolefin moulding materials having improved properties, which are composed of (a) 100 parts by weight of a particulate, partially crystalline polyolefin which has a particle diameter of from 10 to 5000 mu m and an intrinsic viscosity [eta], measured in decahydronaphthalene at 130 degrees c, of from 0. 5 to 15, (b) 0. 001 to 2 parts by weight of a conventional stabilizer or a conventional stabilizer mixture against thermooxidative attack, the mean primary particle size - if the stabilizers are used in powder form - being 0. 1 to 50 mu m and smaller than 1/50 of the mean particle size of the particulate polyolefin used, (c) if desired 0. 1 to 10 parts by weight of a globular or platelet-shaped additive with a maximum particle diameter of less then 20 mu m and a mean particle diamter which is smaller than 1/50 of the mean particle diameter of polyolefin (a), and having a softening temperature which is at least 50 degrees c above the crystallite melting point of the polyolefin, and (d) if desired, usual amounts of other conventional additives and auxiliaries, wherein component (a) is introduced first and is mixed with (d), if employed, in a first stage (i) in a mixer, with stirring and with or without the supply or removal of caloric heat, in the first substage (i. 1) employing a mixing intensity of from 100 to 500 w/i of useful volume, component (a) or the mixture of (a) and (d) is brought, within a period (t1  ) of 2 to 50 minutes, from ambient temperature, which is below the crystallite melting point of polyolefin (a) and is in a particular room temperature, to a temperature (t1  ) which is 0 to 15 degrees c below the crystallite melting point of polyolefin (a), whereupon in the course of a second substage (i. 2) one changes over to a mixing intensity which is 0. 2 to 0. 8 times as great as the mixing intensity in the first substage (i. 1), and component (a) or the mixture of (a) and (d) is brought, within a period (t2  ) of 0. 1 to 10 minutes, from the temperature (t1  ) to a temperature (t2  ) which is 1 to 20 degrees c above the crystallite melting point of polyolefin (a), and additive (b) and any additive (c), or a mixture of (b) and (c) are/is added substantially continuously over the period (t2 ), whereupon in a second stage (ii) the resulting mixture is removed from the mixer in the course of 0. 5 to 30 seconds and brought in the course of 120 seconds to a temperature below the crystallite melting point of polyolefin (a), or the product is further processed direct in the plastic state, without further cooling, on appropriate apparatus.
