<ABSTRACT>
a pipeline to be laid underground or underwater over a  very long distance e. g.  100 km, is heated by skin-effect current  employing an electric source frequency lower than commercial  ones.  the pipeline consists of a fluid-transporting pipe  (12) and a heat-generating pipe (1) utilizing skin effect current  (sect pipe).  the sect pipe consists of a ferromagnetic pipe  (1) and an insulated electric wire (2) passed therethrough, and  the pipeline is provided with an outer covering pipe (14) of  ferromagnetic material so as to enclose the fluid-transporting  pipe (12) and the sect pipe (1).  the outer covering pipe (14) is  connected to the sect pipe (1) and its thickness is such that an  alternating current having leaked out of the sect pipe substantially  does not appear on the outside of the outer covering  pipe (14) but flows only through its inner skin portion.
