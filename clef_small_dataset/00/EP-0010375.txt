<ABSTRACT>
an electrostatographic processing system for obtaining  enhanced copy quality in which transfer to a support material  is effected by a corona generator (48) having an electrode (81)  and the developer mixture includes toner particles having a  particle size distribution with a median diameter by volume of  about 12 microns with not more than 8% preferably 1 to 5%  by volume of the particles having a diameter greater than 20  microns and not more than 20%, preferably 0. 5 to 13. 5%, by  number of the particles having a diameter less than 5 microns.   for best results the ratio of toner content to carrier is such that  there is a solid area reflection optical density of fixed images  of about 1. 3.  further improvement in copy quality is achieved  by also including a bias transfer roll (40) at the transfer station  and by utilizing a fuser having a pressure roll in contact with a  conformable heated fuser roll.

<DESCRIPTION>
electrostatographic processing system the present invention relates to an electrostatographic processing system for producing high quality electrostatically developed images by the transfer of these images to support material, such as sheets of plain paper. in a conventional form of electrostatographic processing, such as xerography, a xerographic plate comprising a layer of photosensitive insul ating material affixed to a conductive backing is used to support electro- static latent images. in the xerographic process, the photosensitive surface is electrostatically charged, and the charged surface is then exposed to a light pattern of the image being reproduced to thereby discharge the sur face in the areas where light strikes thesurface, the undischarged areas of the surface thus form an electrostatic charge pattern (an electrostatic latent image) conforming to the original pattern. the latent image is then developed by contacting it with developing material having a finely divided electrostatically attractable powder referred to as "toner". toner is held on the image areas by the electrostatic charge on the surface. where the charge is greater, a greater amount of toner is deposited. thus, a toner image is produced in conformity with a light image of the copy being reproduced. generally, the developed image is then transferred to a suitable support material (e.g. paper), and the image is affixed thereto to form a permanent record of the original document the developing material normally comprises relatively large carrier beads, which may be insulatively coated metal, and the relatively smaller dry ink particle toner. due to the triboelectric relationsbips between the two, the srnaller toner particles attach themselves to the carrier in great numbers. as the developing material is brought into contact with the photo receptor surface, electrostatic charges on the photeareceptor tends to separate the toner particles from the carrier and deposit the same onto the photo receptor in accordance with the latent image charge pattern. the carrier, some of which may be depleted of toner or partially depleted, is returned to a developer sump for eplenishing with toner particles. in the practice of xerography, the support material is caused to move in synchronized contact with the photosensitive surface during the transfer operation, and an electrical potential opposite from the polarity of the toner is applied to the side of the paper remote frorn the photosensitive surface to electrostatically attract the toner image from the surface to the paper. some modern high speed duplicating machines utilize a single transfer device such as an electrically biased transfer roll to effect the image transfer. although a biased transfer roll system performing as the sole transfer device effects good to excellent copy quality, certain copy quality deficiencies may be present. the most notable of these is the difficulty of transferring very small sizes of toner particles, say on the order of 3 to 10 micron diameter sizes. this inability is apparent because of the geoinetry of a roller type electrostatic transfer device. as the surface of the roller approaches the nip at which transfer of toner particles occur, there is
