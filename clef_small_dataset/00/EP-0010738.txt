<ABSTRACT>
transfer factor to be used therapeutically by paren­ teral administration in human beings to obtain immunity  directed against an antigen which is pathogenic in man,  such as cancer cells or extracts thereof, is produced by  immunizing pigs or other large non-primate mammal host  animals with the antigen and thereafter obtaining transfer  factor from leukocytes from the animal.  the separation of  transfer factor from the leukocytes is performed by  incubating the leukocytes and thereafter rupturing them,  preferably lyophilizing the ruptured cell material, and per­ forming dialysis to exclude molecules having a molecular  weight of above 10,000.
