<ABSTRACT>
1.  circuit arrangement for restoring the mean picture brightness of a video signal for eliminating low-frequency interference voltages, whereby clamping is effected to the level of the respective synchronization-pulse bottoms, containing a switching stage (s1) where a d-c voltage source (uo ) is applied via the collector-emitter path of a switching transistor (t1) to a capacitor (c1) arranged in the input circuit of the video signal and, whereby a pulse-former stage (p) controls the switching transistor of the switching stage, characterized in that for maintaining the potential variations in the pulse bottoms of high-frequency pulse sequences inserted in the synchronization pulses when clamping, a first resistor (r10) is arranged in the switching stage (s1) between collector-emitter path of switching transistor (t1) and d-c voltage source (uo ), and a second resistor (r13) in the pulse-former stage (p), by means of which the height of the clamping pulses generated by pulse-former stage (p) and applied to switching transistor (t1) in switching stage (s1) can be adjusted such that as a result of the voltage drop dependent of the synchronization pulse content and occuring at the first resistor (r10), the voltage (uo1 ) at capacitor (c1 ) in the input circuit of the video signal remains constant for the duration of a synchronization-pulse, and independent of the synchronization-pulse content so that varying potential values of the synchronization-pulse bottoms cannot be converted into amplitude variations of the mean line level of the video signal.
