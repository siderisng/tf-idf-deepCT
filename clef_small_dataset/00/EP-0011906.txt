<ABSTRACT>
a process for the selective hydrogenation of dienes in  pyrolysis gasoline which comprises catalytic hydrogenation  of the pyrolysis gasoline in at least three consecutive reactors  (r₁, r₂ and r₃) in at least two of the said consecutive reactors  recirculating part of the hydrocarbon mixture emerging from  a reactor over that reactor, (5 and 7) no recirculation of the  hydrocarbon mixture emerging from the last of the consecu­ tive reactor (r₃) being carried out over that reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for selective hydrog;fation of dieiies in fyrolysis gasoline this invention relates to a process for the selective hydrogenation of dienes in pyrolysis gasoline. as will be known, pyrolysis gasoline is obtained as a byproduct in the preparation of ethene and/or propene by nears of high-temperature pyrolysis (e.g. cracking in the presence of steam) of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons, such as naphta or gas oil. pyrolysis gasolines on the one hand are extremely unstable owing to the presence of a relatively high proportion of highly olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons, and on the other hand contain aromatic compounds and alkenes having a high octane number which are particularly valuable and are in themselves useful as stable motor gasoline components. in order to obtain a stable gasoline with high octane number from a pyrolysis gasoline the highly olefinically unsaturated compounds, which mainly consist of dienes, for example those of the cyclopentadiene type, have to be removed there from. this removal may be achieved by partial hydrogenation of the dienes to mono-olefins. because the hydrogenation of monoolefins in general leads to a reduction in octane number, such a hydrogenation is to be avoided as much as possible. moreover, in doing so the hydrogen consumption is kept to a desired low level. it is known to hydrogenate dienes present in pyrolysis gasolines selectively with the aid of catalysts with hydrogen ating activity such as supported catalysts comprising a metal .6f group vi and/or group viii of the periodic system of elements. in order to convert a high proportion of the dienes originally present without incurring unacceptably high process temperatures, it has been proposed to recycle part of the product obtained after the selective hydrogenation to the reactor in which the selective hydrogenation is being carried out. however, it is felt as a drawback that during such a process an appreciable amount of mono-olefins is also hydrogenated, which leads to an unattractively high hydrogen consumption. the invention provides a solution for this problem by using at least three consecutive reactors and a specific recirculation pattern. accordingly, tne invention provides a process for the selective hydrogenation of dienes in pyrolysis gasoline which comtnses catalytic hydrogenation of the pyrolysis gasoline in at least three consecutive reactors, in at least two of the said cc.secutive reactors recirculating part of the hydrocarbon mixture emerging from a reactor over that reaetor, no recirculation of the hydrocarbon mixture emerging from the last of the consecutive reactors being carried out over that reactor. it is to be understood that recirculating part of the hydrocarbon mixture emerging from: a reactor over that reactor, stands for the direct recirculation of the said hydrocarbon mixture, no further hydrogenation thereof being carried out in any subsequent reactor before the recirculation. it is essengial t.at in at least two of the consecutive reactors recirculation of part of the hydrocarbon mixture emerging from each of these reactors over the relevant reactor is carried out, because ifl case two consecutive reactors are used and the recirculation is carried out over
