<ABSTRACT>
a method of and apparatus for enabling different parts  of an input television signal to be made available simultaneously  is used as a television standards converter.   successive lines of an input television signal are cyclically  written into n (e. g.  4) successive random access store  sections, using in each cycle the same addresses for the  different sections.  the write addresses are incremented for  successive cycles.  the sections are read from using for each  section addresses which are related to each other and to the  write addresses so as to access a desired set of up to n  successive lines.  these lines are combined by weighted  addition to provide an interpolated output line.  the read  addresses are derived by counting the desired output lines  during each field and multiplying the count by the line  conversion ratio, (namely the number of lines in each input  field divided by the number of lines in each output field).  the  integral part of the resultant controls the read addresses and  the non-integral part controls the weighted addition.  a total  storage of two fields is used, each divided into n sections.   standards conversion to either higher or lower line rates is  possible with improved quality.
