<ABSTRACT>
a bulk liquid container (1) has two expansible liquid carry­ ing compartments which can be independently filled, if  desired with different liquids.  a first compartment is bounded  by a rigid end wall (2), an extensible first sleeve (6) of oil-­ resisting rubber or the like formed with a series of preformed  corrugations, and a first rigid member (5) movable within  rigid outer walls (3) and can be filled or emptied by means of a  valve (10) and de-aired by means of another valve (11).  the  second compartment is bounded by the first rigid member (5),  an extensible second sleeve (7) also provided with a series of  preformed corrugations, and a second rigid member (4)  which can either slide within the rigid outer walls or can  comprise a fixed end wall.
