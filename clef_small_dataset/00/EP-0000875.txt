<ABSTRACT>
a hemostatic clip applicator (2), useful in the rapid and  automatic application of hemostatic clips (37), for the  strangulation of tubular members is disclosed.  the applicator  consists of a main body (20), a clip magazine (102)  externally attached to the main body, clip deforming jaws  (32, 34) attached to one end of the main body, clip feed  means (18) located within the clip magazine, and actuating  means (5, 7) attached to the feed means and deforming jaws.   in operation, one of many hemostatic clips stored in the  clip magazine is fed into the deforming jaws by the interaction  of the actuating means and the feed means.  when  the clip is properly located about a tubular member, further  actuation of the actuating means results in the deformation  of the clip about the tubular member.  upon further activation  of the actuating means, the sequential process of  feeding a clip from the magazine and deforming the clip  about other tubular members may be rapidly repeated  until the supply of clips in the magazine is depleted.
