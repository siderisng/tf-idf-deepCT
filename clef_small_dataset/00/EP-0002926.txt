<ABSTRACT>
a cathode-ray tube comprising an envelope including  a glass faceplate panel (27) and an adjoining glass funnel  (25) sealed to the panel, is provided with protection against  the effects of implosion by means of an elastomeric coating  (39) of polyurethane disposed around and adhered to  external surfaces of the envelope.  this mode of implosion  protection is easier and cheaper to manufacture, especially  in mass production, than is the prior art provision of an  encircling rigid coating of plastic-impregnated fiber or  fabric.  the coating (39) is preferably produced by applying,  drying and curing a coating of an aqueous emulsion of  polyurethane on the desired external surfaces of the tube.   the coating may extend from the panel (27) as far back  on the adjoining funnel (25) as desired, and as far forward  on the panel sidewall (29) and over the viewing window as  desired.  the polyurethane coating (39) may be used in  combination with a metal tension band.
