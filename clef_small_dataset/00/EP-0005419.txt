<ABSTRACT>
one object of present invention provides an aluminium  sulphate composition for use in such processes as the purifying  of water, the sizing of paper and the dewatering of plants, which  comprises a solution of aluminium sulphate and polynuclear  complexes therein of the formula   alm(oh)n(3m-n)+   where m and n are positive integers, having a ph of between  about 3 and the highest ph, at which precipitation of aluminium  hydroxide is substantial avoided and a method of producing the  same.  a further object of the invention relates to the use of an  aluminium sulphate composition comprising a solution of  aluminium sulphate and polynuclear complexes therein of the  formula   alm(oh)n(3m-n)+   where m and n are positive integers, having a ph of between  about 3 and the highest ph, at which precipitation of aluminium  hydroxide is substantial avoided, in such processes as the  purifying of water, the sizing of paper and the dewatering of  plants.  another object of the invention provides a process for  purifying water, sizing paper, dewatering plants and the like,  which process is characterized by using in such a process a  solution of aluminium sulphate and polynuclear complexes  therein of the formula   alm(oh)n(3m-n)+   where m and an are positive integers, having a ph of between  about 3 and the highest ph, at which precipitation of aluminium  hydroxide is substantial avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
aluminium sulphate compositions containing polynuclear complexes and a method of producing the same and the use thereof the present invention relates to aluminium sulphate compositions for use in such processes as the purification of water, the sizing of paper, and the de-watering of plants and specifically to compositions which will provide improved effect in above mentioned applications. the invention also relates to a method for producing said aluminium sulphate composition and the use thereof and finally to a process of purifying water, sizing paper, dewatering plants and the like. aluminium sulphate, hereinafter referred to as als, for the purification of untreated water and the sizing of paper normally has a composition which can be described approximately as a12(504 14h20. the sulphate content is slightly less than that which the formula states. the aluminium content is 9.1 %. in addition to aluminium sulphate, aluminium sulphate for the chemical purification of sewage water also contains iron(iii)#ulphate and a certain amount of insoluble substance. thus, the aluminium sulphate available under the tradename bolide avr contains 7% al, 3s fe and 2.5 < insoluble substance. when dissolving als in water, the solution is acid owing to the fact that the aluminium ions are hydrolyzed in accordance with the rea.-- tion formulae: emi1.1 the concentration of als-solutions prepared in this way can vary between 0.5 and soz, while the ph of said solutions is about 3.4 - 2.4. the ph-value of the solutions decreases with increasing als-concentration. the ph of an aluminium sulphate solution thus prepared can be raised by adding alkali in the form of, e.g., alkali metal hydroxide, ammonia or calcium hydroxide. the ph of the solution can be lowered by adding an acid, e.g. sulphuric acid. the concentration of different aluminium hydroxide ions is dependent upon the ph of the solution. the figure illustrates how the concentration of different complex ions varies with the ph. the diagram is drawn for emi2.1 with the aid of thermodynamic equilibrium constants taken from the literature, and thus applies when the activity coefficients are equal to 1. in reality, these coefficients are not equal to 1. consequently, the diagram does not give the absolute values of the concentration, but provides rather a qualitative picture of how the concentration of the various complexes varies when the ph is changed. the poly-nuclear complex, emi2.2 may be of different sorts, i.e. m and n may have different values, but must be pusitive integers and the ratio n/m is generally within the range about 2.3 and 2.7. a dominant complex, however, is emi2.3 and this complex thus represents all the poly-nuclear complexes in the figure. as will be seen from the diagram, when an aluminium sulphate solution prepared by dissolving aluminium sulphate and having a ph of about 3, is alkalized, the amount of poly-nuclear complexes contained in the solution will first increase, and then decrease. the solution contains its maximum quantity of poly-nuclear complexes when the ph is about 4.8. in conjunction with the advent of the present invention,
