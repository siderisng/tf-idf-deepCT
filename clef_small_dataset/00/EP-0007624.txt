<ABSTRACT>
a process is disclosed for the mixing of relatively small  amounts of liquid or liquefied additive with relatively large  amounts of solid granular material comprising: forming, in a  conduit (64), a continuous pneumatic- or gravity-borne  stream of solid granular material; passing an inert gas (47)  stream through a constricting orifice to maintain sonic veloc­ ity flow conditions therein; concurrently introducing a stream  of said liquid or liquefied additive (20) into said inert gas  stream in said constricting orifice under conditions such that  combined stream sonic velocity flow conditions are main­ tained; and introducing the resulting combined liquid or  liquefied additive and inert gas streams into said conduit (54)  to effect addition of said liquid or liquefied additive (20) to said  solid granular material.
