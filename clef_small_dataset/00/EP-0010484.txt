<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a gaseous chromisation of the steels, which makes it possible to very significantly increase the thickness of the chromed layer, and its tenacity. For this purpose, the present invention relates to a percention to the chromisity processes, taken by a method of chromisation of the steels on a depth E greater than 30 microns, which can be used for steels having a carbon content at least equal to 0, 2%, in particular for construction steels and for tool steels, characterized by the combination of three successive treatments, the first of these three treatments consisting of ionic nitriding of a surface layer of thickness between 100 and 350. microns, this ion nitridge being carried out in an atmosphere constituted by a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen, at a temperature of between 450 ° C and 650 ° C, for a period of between 5 and 40 hours, so as to obtain between 1.5% and 2.5% nitrogen in the nitrous layer, the second of these treatments consisting of a chromium carbide chromium chromation, of a duration of between 5 and 30 hours, and carried out at temperatures between 850 ° C and 1,100 ° C, the century of these three treatments being a heat treatment comprising an oil quenching of the chromiscent piece followed by an income to a temerature between 600. ° C and 650 ° C, with a duration between 30 minutes and 10 hours depending on the dimension of the treated part. The invention applies to the chromisation of steels containing more than 0.2% carbon, and more specifically construction steels and tool steels.
