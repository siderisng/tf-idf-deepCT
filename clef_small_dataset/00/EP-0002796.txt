<ABSTRACT>
1.  sheet or web feeding device for a printing apparatus, in particular a terminal printer, with a print roll (1) used for advance and suport purpose, with feeding means for marginally perforated forms, which, viewed in the direction of feed, is arranged behind the print roll (1) and is provided with pins (15), a controllable step drive for providing the advance force, a free-running gear arrangement on the shaft (3) of the print roll (1), which can be driven by a step drive, and wherein the feeding means provided with the pins (5) can be made to drivingly engage the gear arrangement, characterized in that a) a toothed ratchet wheel (28) is arranged non-rotatable and axially shiftable on the shaft (3) of the print roll (1), b) the ratchet wheel (28) is provided with a second coupling part (26, 27) which can be made to engage a first coupling part (24, 25), c) when the ratchet wheel (28) is decoupled and non-rotatably latched by a detent (33), the feeding means (4, 5) provided with the pins (5) is solely connected to the step drive (20, 21) through the free-running gear arrangement (19, 23, 22) while the print roll (1) is inoperative, d) when the gear arrangement (19, 23, 22) and ratchet wheel (28) are coupled, while the ratchet wheel (28) is unlatched and thus rotatable, both the print roll (1), through the shaft (3), and the feeding means (4, 5) provided with the pins (15) are drivingly connected to the step drive (20, 21).
