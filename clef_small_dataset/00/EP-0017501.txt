<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for extrusion of a plastics pipe, comprising a  plurality of different layers is disclosed, including an extruÂ­ sion die having a base-plate (9) with a mandrel (15,1)  extending therefrom, a stack of annular die plates (8,7,6, 5  and 4) secured to the base plate and defining with the  mandrel (15,1) an annular extrusion passage leading to an  annular extrusion outlet (16).  annular plenum chambers (40,  46 and 50) defined respectively between mandrel (15) and  plate (8), between plate (8) and plate (7), and between plate  (6) and plate (5) respectively lead into the annular extrusion  passage upstream of the extrusion opening.  equalisation  rings (11 and 12) and a front die member (2) are adjustable  diametrally with respect to the mandrel (15) to adjust the  concentricity of the different layers in the pipe produced.   molten plastics material may be fed from a single source to  the plenum chambers (40 and 50) feeding the material for the  inner and outer layers of the pipe via a distributor having  separate flow adjusters for each of two conduits connectable  with the chambers (40 and 50)
