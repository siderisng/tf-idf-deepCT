<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a load handling apparatus for  loading and particurlarly unloading of palletized goods on  road and rail vehicles, ships, aircraft etc.  and also for loading  and unloading of goods in large goods containers.  characteristic  of the load handling apparatus according to the invention  is that it comprises at least two elongated, relatively  narrow and long sections one of which forms a lower supporting  section (15) while the other forms an upper lifter and  conveyer section (16) raisably and lowerably mounted on the  supporting section (15) and parallel therewith and forming  together with the first-mentioned section an elongated narrow  and low unit which is insertible through either of such  open-ended passages of restricted width and height at the  underside of the bottom of conventional pallets intended for  the insertion of the lift forks of forklift trucks, the lifter and  conveyer section (16) being raisable to a greater height and  being lowerable to a smaller height than that of such a passage  at the bottom of a pallet resting on a supporting surface  for lifting goods, after the insertion of the unit through such a  passage under the goods, transporting the goods along the  lifter and conveyer section (16) and lowering the goods onto  the supporting surface, whereupon the unit can be withdrawn  from under the goods.
