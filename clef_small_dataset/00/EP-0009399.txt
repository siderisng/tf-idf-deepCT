<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to shower fittings especially  those used in the paper and board making industries.   the shower fitting incorporates at least one jet for direct足 ing on to a surface a jet of liquid which is suitable for clean足 ing and/or reconditioning the surface.  the jet or jets are  normally mounted in a tube to which the liquid is supplied  and which is reciprocated across the surface to ensure  that the entire width of the surface is treated and to avoid  damage to the surface that might result if a jet of liquid  is directed constantly at the same area of the surface.  the invention is concerned with the problem of en足 suring adequate support and protection for the tube.  in one particular embodiment, the tube 1 is mounted  for reciprocation inside a support tube 3.  support bushes  2 spaced along the axial length of the tube 1 ensure ade足 quate support whilst protection is provided by the outer  tube 3.  the tube 1 carries a plurality of jets 7 and the outer  tube has a slot 13 aligned with the jets 7 to allow liquid  emerging from the latter to reach the surface.  driving means  for example an hydraulically-actuated motor 10 is mounted  at one end of the outer tube 3 and is connected to the inner  tube 1 to reciprocate the latter.  treatment liquid is supplied to the inner tube 1 via  one end thereof.
