<ABSTRACT>
a strip (10) of slips (12) is characterised by breaking  portions (62, 64) at which each individual clip (12a, 12b,  12c) is separable from its longitudinal neighbours these  portions being coextensive, longitudinally of the strip, with  the line of separation (60) which divides off each clip from  its longitudinal neighbours and which is formed without  removal of material of the strip.  this line is achieved by  shearing the material of the strip while bowing it about a  longitudinal axis so as to present a curved surface to an  oncoming shearing tool which has an oppositely curved  surface.  the extent of intersection of the opposite curve  defines the length of the line of the separation.  the breaking  portion is adjacent each end of the line.  the clips during  severence suffer apparent laterial contraction but no  longitudinal distortion.
