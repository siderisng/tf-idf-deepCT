<ABSTRACT>
a pharmaceutical composition characterized by as active  ingredient a 3,4-dihydro-3-oxoquinoxaline of the formula:    wherein r and r⁴ are individually h, no₂ or ch₃o; r₁ and r²  are individually h, no₂, ch₃o or halo such that at least one of  r, r¹, r² and r⁴ is other than h, such that if neither r¹ and r² is  no₂ or ch₃o, both rr¹ and r² are individually halo and both r  and r⁴ are h, and such that one of r¹ and r² is ch₃o only if one  of r, r¹, r² and r⁴ is no₂; r³ is c₁-c₄ alkyl, c₃-c₆ cycloalkyl,  c₃-c₄ alkenyl, h or 2-chloroethyl; and n is 0 or 2, e. g.  ethyl  6,7-dibromo- 3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-2- quinoxaline carboxylate,  and excipients is useful for suppressing viral infection in  mammals.  all but one of the quinoxalines disclosed are new.   the compounds are prepared by reacting an o-phenylene  diamine with an α-ketodibasic acid.  certain of the compounds  are prepared by reacting a 6-nitro-4,5- disubstituted aniline  with an alkyl malonyl chloride followed by annelation in the  presence of sodium ethoxide and then treatment with phos­ phorus trichloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
pharmaceutical compdsition containing 3,4-dihydro -3-oxo-2-quinoxalines ,--novel such quinoxalines and processes for the production thereof a pharmaceutical composition containing as the active ingredient, a 3,4-dihydro-3-oxoquinoxaline suppresses viral infection in mammals. all but one of the compounds are new. quinoxalines are known which have antiviral or antibacterial action. for example, acheson, j. chem. soc. 4731 (1950) reports that p-2'-quinoxalinylaminobenzoyl-(-)glutamic acid had a small growthinhibitory effect on l. casei. the author also prepared 2- (2-diethylaminoethyl)aminoauinoxaline, the corresponding 6,7-dichloro derivative and the corresponding diethylaminopropyl derivative but found that all of these compounds were inactive against p. gallinaceum in chicks. 6,7-dichloro-2-hydroxyquinoxaline- 3-carboxylic acid and its ethyl ester were prepared and used as intermediates in the production of these diethylaminoalkylaminoquinoxalines. belgium patent 769,491 discloses 2,3-dimensaptomethyl quinoxalines in which the benzene ring can be substituted with alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, or alkylenedioxy. the compounds are said to be antiviral agents. 3,6-diamino2-quinoxaline carboxamides, stated to be useful as diuretics, anticonvulsant, antiinflammatory agents, and to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex, are disclosed in u.s. patent 3,192,212. a. group of antiviral quinazolines (isomeric with quinoxalines) are disclosed in belgium patent 815,196. . series of antiviral 2chloro- or 2-hydrazinoquinoxalines are disclosed in three papers by westphal, et al. pharmazie, 32, 570-571, 687-689, 563-565 (1977). the following types of compounds were prepared: quinoxaline-2-ones substituted in the 3 position with a heterocyclic ring including benzimidazole, benzothiazole, or benzoxazole (no utility was given for these compounds); 2-chloro or 2-hydrazinoquinoxalines stated to be active against coxsackie b, vaccina, sindbas, and pseudorabies viruses; and, finally, a group of s-trizolo[4,3-ajquinoxalines prepared by cyclizing a 2-hydrazinoquinoxaline, were allegedly useful against some of the above viruses. in addition to the above listed antiviral agents having the basic quinoxaline structure, there has been a considerable amount of work carried out on quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides as antiviral agents. much of this work has been summarized in hurst, et al., brit. j. pharmacal., 8, 297, (1953). according to this summary, quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides were the most active compounds tested in experimental psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum infections. a large number of derivatives of the quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides are summarized on page 301 of the article and include compounds with the following substituents in the quin oxaline ring: ethyl, ethoxymethyl, acetyoxymethyl, 2-methyl-3-ethyl, 2-methyl-3-carboethoxy, 2,3-dihydroxy methyl, 2,3-diiodomethyl, 2,3-bis (dimethylaminomethyl), etc. substituents in the benzene ring include: halogens, alkyl, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, carboethoxy, carbamyl, acetamido, etc. (see also derwent abstract 5641u abstracting u.k. patent 1,305,138). a similar group of quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides are disclosed in belgian patent 683,206, abstracted as derwent no. 25,122. substituted 2-formylquinoxaline-1,4-dioxides are disclosed in u.s. patent 3,433,87i. the compounds are said to be antibacterial and antiviral compounds. u.k. patent 1,308,370 discloses an improved method of making substituted quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides having a variety of substituents in the quinoxaline ring including carboxamides (page 13), esters (page 15), a third ring (page 17-21), acyl derivatives (page 21), 3-hydroxy-2-alkoxy carbonyl derivatives (page 23), hydroxy carboxamides (page 24), etc. these compounds are alleged to have in vitro activity against harmful micro-organisms. antiviral activity is not mentioned. another patent relating to methods of preparing quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides,
