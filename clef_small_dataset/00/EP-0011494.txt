<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for recovering information at a  substantially constant rate from a rotable information stor­ age disc (110).  the information is stored on the disc (110) in a  plurality of substantially circular and concentrically arranged  information tracks, with a substantially uniform recording  density, and it is recovered by controllably rotating the disc,  relative to a transducer (128) at an angular velocity substan­ tially inversely proportional to the radius of the correspond­ ing track.  the apparatus includes a coarse speed control  potentiometer (130) for producing a measure of the radius of  the particular information track from which information is  being recovered, and fine speed control means (136) for  comparing the relative phase angles of a periodic signal in  the recovered information and a periodic reference signal  and for producing a fine speed control signal proportional to  the phase difference.  the measure of radius and the fine  speed control signal are summed together and coupled to a  voltage-controlled oscillator (132) to produce a composite  speed control signal, which is coupled to a servo (134) to  rotate the disc (110) at a corresponding angular velocity.
