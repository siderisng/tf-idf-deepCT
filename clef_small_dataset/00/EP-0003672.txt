<ABSTRACT>
a device for filling the interstices of multistranded  cable with powder, comprising an outer cylindrical housing  (14) and a concentric inner tube (16) with an annular  chamber (18) between them.  the tube at one end carries  a coaxial impeller (32) located at the outlet end portion  (26) of the housing.  powder is fed into the chamber and a  helical screw (20) pushes the powder onto the impeller  which is rotated to distribute the powder onto conductors  (40) passing from a strander around the device and into a  closing die (12).
