<ABSTRACT>
a circuit for generating a percussion envelope for use in  electronic organs and similar electronic keyboard instru­ ments wherein the envelope has an attack overshoot, a long  decay, and a snub decay when the key is released.  a velocity  sensing feature (74) is included, whereby the force with which  the key is struck determines the amount of capacitor dis­ charge, and the voltage remaining on the capacitor (82) is  compared with the amplitude of the attack portion of the  envelope in a first comparator (130) such that decay is initi­ ated when a compare condition is reached.  a second com­ parator (138) sets the amplitude at which the envelope under­ goes transition from a fast decay to the normal long decay.   the timing for the attack and three decay portions of the  envelope are independently controlled by means of four clock  driven electronic gate circuits (50, 52, 56, 60) which incremen­ tally charge and discharge the main timing capacitor (62).  the  gate circuits (50, 52, 56, 60) include a pair of serially connected  field effect transistors (92,94) having a capacitor (98) con­ nected at their juncture.  the timing control for each individual  keyer, including all of the timing capacitors, is contained  within a separate lsi chip (101).
