<ABSTRACT>
this invention is directed to a process for preparing a  2-isocyanatoalkyl ester of an unsaturated carboxylic acid by  reacting a water-soluble 2-alkenyl-2- oxazoline with a solution  of phosgene in a water-immiscible organic solvent in the  presence of an aqueous solution of a hydrochloric acid  acceptor.  the process is characterized by adding the  2-alkenyl-2- oxazoline into the reaction mixture as an aqueous  soluion.  the aqueous solution of the 2-alkenyl-2- oxazoline  is prepared by reacting a 2-alkyl-2-oxazoline with  formaldehyde to form 2-(α-hydroxymethylalkyl)­ -2-oxazoline, dehydrating the 2-(α-hydroxymethylalkyl)­ -2-oxazoline to form the 2-alkenyl-2- oxazoline, and separating  a voatile composition from the reaction product of the  dehydrating step which when condensed, comprises an  aqueous solution of the 2-alkenyl-2- oxazoline.  the  2-isocyanatoalkyl esters produced by the process of this  invention are useful as reactive intermediates in preparing  coating formulations from hydroxyl-containing compounds  that are curable through the carbon-to-carbon double bond.
