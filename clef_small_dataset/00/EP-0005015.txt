<ABSTRACT>
it has been found that 1,3-di-n-butyl-7-(2-oxo-propyl)  xanthine is a particularly effective agent for increasing  oxygen partial pressure and contractility in ischaemic  and skeletal muscle.  pharmaceutical compositions containing  1 to 30 mg of this agent are described.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
pharmaceutical compositions containing a xanthine derivative the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing 1, 3-di-n-butyl-7- ( 2-oxopropyl) - xanthine. british patent specification no. 1441562 referred to the compounds of the formula (i): emi1.1 wherein r1 and r2 which may be the same or different, each represents a straight-chain or branched-chain alkl radical of 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or a cyclohexyl, alkoxyalkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical, and a represents a hydrocarbon radical having up to 4 carbon atoms which may be substituted by a methyl group. the compounds of the formula (i) were described as effective in increasing the blood flow through skeletal muscles while at the same time showing low toxicity. the compound of the formula (i) said to be preferred was that wherein r1 is an n-butyl group, r2 is an n-butyl group and a is a ch2ch2 group. that compound was shown to be highly effective. german patent application no. 2462367 indicates that the compouncs of the formula (i) may in general be employed as unit doses of about 200-600 mgs so that they would be expected to be used at a similar dose to known agents such as pentoxyphylline. the published low qral toxicity of xanthin such as pentoxyphylline and the compound of the formula (i) where r1 and r2 are n-butyl groups and a is a ch2ch2 group means that such high doses are acceptable. it has now been discovered that one compound within formula (i) is extremely potent in increasing oxygen tension and contractility in ischaemic and skeletal muscle. these properties reflect an improvement in the metabolic status of the tissue which in turn makes the compound of great potential use as an agent for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease such as intermittent claudicatic this compound has a low acute toxicity so that the conventional high doses would have been expected to be used in the clinic. however the extremely high potency of this compound allows its use in surprisingly low dose. accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises 1 to 30 mg of 1,3-di-n-butyl-7-(2-oxopropyl)xanthine and a pharmaceuticall acceptable carrier therefor. more suitably the composition of this invention will contain from 2 to 25 mgs of 1,3-di-n-butyl-7 (2-oxopropyl)xanthine and preferably from 2.5 to 20 mgs of 1,3-di-n-butyl-7-(2-oxopropyl)xanthine, for example from 5 to 15 mgs. thus suitable compositions of this invention may contain about, for example, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15 17.5 or 20 mgs of 1,3-di-n-butyl-7-(2-oxopropyl)xanthine. the compositions of this invention may be administerec one or more times a day so that the daily dose is in the region of 2.5 - 90 mgs, and more usually 5 - 50 mgs, for example about 10 - 40 mgs. the composition is often administered twice or three times a day. generally the compositions of this invention will be adapted for administration by injection or for oral administration. although 1,3-di-n-butyl-7-(2-oxopropyl)xanthine is only sparingly soluble in aqueous media the enhanced potency of the compound renders it suitable for use in injectable solutions,
