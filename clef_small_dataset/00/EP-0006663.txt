<ABSTRACT>
a method and device of locating, assessing and check­ ing the circumferential shapes of an object, of imaging the  object, of pointwise measuring the intensity of the light  emitted by each point and of comparing the measured  values with given values comprising the integration of the  measured light intensities of a sequence of points in a  selected direction, counting the points of said sequence  having at least one predetermined light intensity, and  determining the locations of the circumferential points.

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to a method and a device for locating, assessing and checking the circumferential shape of an object. in order to assess the contours of an object in industry and in purely scientific research a method may be used in which the image of the object may be defined, for example, in a co-ordinate system by scanning, for example, pointwise. from this image of discrete values the shape characteristics of the object can be calculated and measured and for each resultant measuring value a comparison may be made with a predetermined value. if the measured and the fixed values differ from one another, a decision can be taken in accordance with predetermined criteria whether the examined object, for example, satisfies the requirements. in order to obtain sufficient accuracy a large number of measuring points is required. the means for recording the measuring points, their fixing thereof and processing them into measuring values of the shape characteristics and comparing said measuring values with the given values usually comprise a large computer. a drawback of this method is that due to the great amount of data a comparatively large memory and a large number of calculations are required, whilst furthermore due to the large number of data to be processed said method is comparatively timeconsuming. as an alternative , photographic means are used for fixing the circumferential shape of an object for comparison with a reference image. the comparison of the pictures is usually performed visually. this method is time-consuming and requires much labour. the object of the invention is to mitigate the aforesaid disadvantages and to provide a method and a device which permit of assessing the circumferential shape of an object, of comparing it with given values and of deciding whether the dimensions and the shape of the examined object are lying within the prefixed limits within a short time of, for example, two seconds at comparatively low costs. according to the invention this is achieved by imaging the object, by measuring pointwise the intensity of the light emitted by each point, by integrating the measured light intensities of a sequence of points in a selected direction, by counting the points of said sequence having at least a predetermined light intensity, by assessing the location of the circumferential points and by comparing the measured values with given values. according to the invention the integration of the light intensities of a number of associated points appreciably reduces the amount of data to be processed, whilst the resultant integrated value together with the count of a number of points having a light intensity exceeding a selected threshold value and the location of the circumferential points is sufficient for taking certain decisions by calculation. the location of the object within the field of view is obtained by detecting the co-ordinates in the selected direction of the circumferential points of the object. in carrying out this method first a row in the direction of length and subsequently a row at right angles
