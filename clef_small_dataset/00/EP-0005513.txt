<ABSTRACT>
A mounting device (10) for assembling carrier plates with components carries on the top of a working surface (16) a holder (28) for the carrier plate (30).By opening (37) in the working surface (16), one of a series of vessels (38) of the operator is accessible to the removal of components accessible.The vessels (38) are guided below the working surface (16) along a guide path loop in two small distance superimposed planes, such that a operator seated on the working surface (16) with the knees below the containers located in the lower plane (38)Place finds.In order to achieve simple construction and reliable function of the mounting device (10), the axis of the guide path loop is arranged horizontally and the vessels (38) are hung pendant.
