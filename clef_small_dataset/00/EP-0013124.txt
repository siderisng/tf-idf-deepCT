<ABSTRACT>
encoded digital television signals having a defined  bandwidth are transmitted at reduced bandwidth by regularly  omitting (18) one in every n of the signal samples, where n is  greater than two and is preferably three or four.  at a receiver  the omitted samples are regenerated by estimating (26) their  values from the samples of the reduced-rate transmitted  signal by making use of frequency components outside the  normal defined bandwidth of the original signal.  the estima­ tion can be achieved by a symmetrical digital transversal filter  of which one in every n coefficients is zero, the amplitude/fre­ quency characteristic of the filter being unity throughout the  defined bandwidth of the tv signal and antisymmetric about  half the mean lower sample rate.
