<ABSTRACT>
a safety circuit for a potentially dangerous machine (m)  monitored by light and which works in an operating cycle.  a  safety circuit is described which utilises a series of relays (a,b,  c, d, g) each of which is switched from an energised to a  de-energised condition once during each working cycle of the  machine so that each of the relay contact also opens and  closes during the working cycle.  in this way each relay contact  is tested.  the relays are so interconnected that if one contact  should stick it will interrupt the sequence and will ensure the  potentially dangerous machine e. g.  a press is rendered inac­ tive.  circuits are given for both hand fed and automatic  machines which are monitored by a light barrier or curtain  (17).  for the hand fed machine the cycle is initiated by the  operator reaching through the light barrier to insert an object  into the machine.  for an automatically fed machine the test  cycle is initiated by a switch (27) automatically activated once  per cycle.
