<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a virtual memory data proces­ sing system, and the specification describes such a system in  which apparatus is provided for enabling i/o adapters (4) to  use virtual addresses.  after each i/0 data transfer, the main  memory (5) address involved in the transfer is incremented.   this address is maintained in i/o register associated with the  i/o adapter (4) performing the transfer.  if a page boundary is  crossed in the process of incrementing, the channel (3) forms  an i/o event indicating the page crossing and calling for  translation of the incremented address.  when the i/o adapter  (4) involved in the page crossing attempts a further data trans­ fer, the channel (3) disconnects the i/o adapter.  the channel  (3) holds the i/o adapter (4) disconnected until the page cros­ ing denoted by the i/o event has been resolved by translat­ ing the incremented address and providing a new main mem­ ory address for continuing the data transfer.  because the  disconnect is effected by ignoring the priority of the discon­ nected adapter when it requests service, other adapters of  lower priority can be serviced by the channel during the dis­ connect.  when completion of the address translation is sig­ nalled, the i/o adapter is no longer held disconnected.
