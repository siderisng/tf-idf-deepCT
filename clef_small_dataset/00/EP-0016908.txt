<ABSTRACT>
device for reversibly feeding and driving a ribbon be足 tween two reels and for maintaining the ribbon under constant  tension.  first and second ribbon reels (18) and (19) are res足 pectively in peripheral non-slip driving engagement with drive  belts (39) and (40).  each belt (39, 40) engages a large diameter  drive pulley (36, 38) and a small diameter drive pulley (35,37).   pulleys (35-38) are coupled through oneway clutches to four  gears (31-34) of equal diameters, driven by a reversible input  gear (30).  when gear (30) rotates counterclockwise, only pul足 leys (35) and (38) are driven and, in turn, drive their associated  belts (39) and (40) in a forward direction wherein reel (19)  takes up ribbon (20), belt (40) being driven faster than belt  (39).  when gear (30) rotates clockwise, only pulleys (36 and  37) are driven and in turn drive belts (39) and (40) in the re足 verse direction, with belt (39) being driven faster than belt (40)  and reel (18) taking up the ribbon.  this device is suitable for  use as an off-the-carrier ribbon feed and drive for high speed  impact printers.
