<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiation sensitive via pull mass and their use as a negative resist.It also relates to a method for producing a negative resist image.The radiation-sensitive coating composition comprises reaction products of a monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid with an epoxy resin, preferably with an epichlorohydrin-2.2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane diglycidyl ether epoxy and an epoxidized novolak resin;a polyethylenically unsaturated compound;An em photoinitiator and possibly a non-reactive diluent.The coating mass may additionally contain a pheno xyharz.The coating compositions according to the invention have a drawn image-forming and film-forming properties, so that they can be used simultaneously as negative resist materials and for producing permanent protective coatings.
