<ABSTRACT>
metal shelving for use in the domestic and industrial field, frequently also called wall shelving, consists of rails (1) provided with longitudinal slots, of flat supports (2) having hooks (10) formed on one support end, for suspension in the longitudinal slots, and of at least one shelf base (3) which can be placed upon two supports and has downwardly folded edge strips (11) on all four sides, the lateral edge strips gripping over the supports and bearing against the outer sides thereof.  to secure the shelf base against forward and rearward displacement, two projections (7,6), for example embossed hemispherical caps, are formed on each support (2), the said projections facing the associated other support and bearing against the front and rear edge strips (11) of the shelf base (3) respectively.  the shelf base (3) is flush with the front end of the supports (2) whilst the rear edge of the shelf base (3) is spaced apart from the rail (1) in order to be able to insert a shelving back wall (4).  the supports (2) have an embossed portion (5), similar to their wedge shape, for the purpose of reinforcement.  <image>
