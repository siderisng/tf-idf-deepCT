<ABSTRACT>
a helical gear pump, compressor or motor including  an inner member (17, 112, 161) with an external helical  gear form having n starts, an outer member (110, 162)  with a cooperating internal gear form having n Â± 1  starts, means (100-103) for supporting the outer member  and a geared drive for causing relative rotation between  the inner and outer members.  in order to reduce the total axial length, in order to  reduce wear and in order to increase the flexibility of use,  the geared connection comprises a first externally toothed  gear wheel (7, 115) mounted on the inner member (10,  112), a second externally toothed gear wheel (8, 116)  associated with the outer member and a toothed gear  connection (5, 6, 117-122) associated with said first and  second wheels to synchronize the relative rotations of  said inner and outer members whereby said relative rotation  will take place independently of any contact between  the helical gear forms of the inner and outer members.
