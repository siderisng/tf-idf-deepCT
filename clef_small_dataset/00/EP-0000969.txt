<ABSTRACT>
a disposable absorbent brief having substantially  straight parallel elastic members (10) on either side of  the crotch and separate means to secure the brief to the  wearer's thighs and to the wearer's waist, said brief  being especially adapted for use by wearers having adult  leg configurations.  the securement means (15) which  forms a thigh seal is placed within an anchoring region of  the brief comprising the area between the edge of the  brief and two line segments which lie transversely outward  of the elastic member and which form angles of about 90  and about 140 degrees, respectively, in the plane of the  diaper with respect to the elastic member.  the apex of  these angles is at one functional endpoint of the elastic  member.  when the brief is worn the elastic member, the securement  means, and portions of the material of the brief  cooperate to form a fluid-stopping seal around the thigh  of the wearer, said seal being located within a plane  substantially perpendicular to the thigh bone of the wearer.
