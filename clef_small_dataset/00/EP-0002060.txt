<ABSTRACT>
a fluid dispensing instrument and method for placing  a drug material into the canals of the fallopian tubes of a  female.  the instrument (20) has a housing (21) carrying  a piston and cylinder assembly (22).  an elongated flexible  tubular probe (23) attached to the housing (21) carries an  expandable sleeve (24).  the piston and cylinder assembly  (22) is operable to fully collapse the sleeve (24) prior to  insertion through the cervical opening into the uterine  cavity.  after the sleeve (24) is inserted into the uterine  cavity, an ampulla (26) storing the drug material is loaded  into the instrument (20).  the piston and cylinder assembly  (22) is then actuated to initially partially expand the sleeve  (24).  operation of the piston and cylinder assembly (22)  moves a plunger into the container to dispense the drug  material into the uterine cavity above the partly expanded  balloon.  the sleeve (24) is then fully expanded to move  the drug material from the uterine cavity into the canals of  the fallopian tubes.
