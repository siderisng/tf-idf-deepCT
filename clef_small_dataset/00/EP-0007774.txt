<ABSTRACT>
the track for a locomotive toy, which track can be rolled  up and put away when not required for use and does not  require any assembly of track sections by the user, comprises  a layer of felt material (1) defining by variations in its thickness  a track layout (2) capable of guiding the movement of a  locomotive toy along the layout (2).  the method of making the  track comprises defining a track layout (2) in a sheet of felt  material (1) containing a thermo-setting resin by impressing  the shape of the track layout (2) in the felt material (1) under  heat and pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
tracks for locomotive toys this invention relates to tracks for locomotive toys. locomotive toys are very popular form of toy and many such as model railway engines and model racing cars, run on special track sections joined together to form a layout. it is, however, necessary to ensure that a reasonably secure join is made between the track sections in order to maintain continuity and avoid derailment or like accident. to achieve this wend,; fairly rigid structures and mating parts are employed. very young children, for example three-year olds, do not however possess much skill in assembling parts and are moreover quite likely to play with a track section by hitting another child with it. rigid track sections with mating parts are not therefore suitable for use by the very young. on the other hand sufficient rigidity must be provided to enable the track to fulfil its function in guiding the locomotive toy and the easy storage obtained by having the layout divisible into sections is an advantage. the invention as claimed is intended to provide track for a locomotive toy which is suitable for use by very young children and is easy to store. according to the invention, track for a locomotive toy comprises a layer of felt material defining by variations in its thickness a track layout capable of guiding the movement of a locomotive toy along the layout. the advantages offered by the invention are that the track is safe in the hands of very young children, can be rolled up and put away when not required for use, and does not require any assembly of track sections by the user. advantageously, the felt material can be bonded to a flexible backing layer. the flexible backing layer strengthens the construction but still allows the track to be rolled up and put away when not required for use. the felt material can be a needle felt carpet material. such material can be easily cleaned using a vacuum cleaner. the flexible backing layer can be a resilient polymeric material such as rubber. this has the advantage of providing a non-slip surface underneath the track. the outer surface of the flexible backing layer can be formed with ribs or an array of pockets. this has the advantage of saving material and providing strength with resilience. the track layout can take the form of two spaced parallel lines of indentation in the felt material layer. the track layout can define a closed loop. the surface of the felt material layer can carry an image of scenery. the surface can be contoured to correspond to parts of the image. the layerÂ¯of felt material can define by the variations in its thickness a channel, broad relative to its depth, defining a track layout capable of guiding the movement of a locomotive toy along the layout. the channel has the advantages of being easy for a very young child to use, eass to keep free from dust and providing good guidance for the toy.
