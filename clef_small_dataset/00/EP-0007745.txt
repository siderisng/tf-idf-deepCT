<ABSTRACT>
a foam plastics sheet material, such as a wallcovering,  comprises a substrate web (10, 20) a printed pattern, or overall  coating, (11, 21) and a foamable coating (12a, 12b, 22).  the  print composition includes an organic pigment and the foam­ able coating is selected to provide a migration path for the  pigment.  the degree of migration is dependent upon the  foam thickness and hence graduated colour tones (30, 31, 32)  can be derived from a single printing by control of foam  thickness.  in a preferred process, the foam thickness control is  obtained by pre-embossing the substrate web.  the print pat­ tern or overall coating can include a foaming agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
foam plastics sheet materials this invention relates to foam plastics sheet materials, for example, with foamed wallcoverings having decorative effects based mainly on comparative colour intensity. such effects can be achieved by the necessary number of printing operations, possibly with simultaneous mechanical embossing, but this tends to increase cost and the practical range of variation becomes limited. the invention aims to provide a new way of producing, in foam wallcovering and the like, decorative effects based on colour intensity without the need for supplementary printing operations and mechanical embossing and providing an easy way of controlling colour intensity, the control being co-related and registered with relief decorative effects. the material according to the invention comprises a substrate web having thereon a base coat and a foam coat characterised in that the base coat comprises an organic pigment and some of the pigment has migrated through the foam coat to the surface of the foam coat so that the overall surface of the material exposes two different colouratiops. the coats may be partial or overall so long as a part of the foam coat overlaps the base coat to give a migration path. the two colourations may differ in intensity or differ in spectral position. the foam coat may have varying thickness so that the amount of pigment migrating to the surface varies according to the thickness. the invention also provides a process for the productior. of a decorative sheet material comprising applying to at least parts of the surface of a substrate web a composition containing an organic pigment, applying, over at least soy of the parts of the substrate to which said organic pigment had been applied, a foamable composition containing a thermoplastic polymeric material and a heat decomposable blowing agent, and heating said coated substrate to effect foaming of the foamable composition, wherein said organic pigment is soluble in, and migrates into, said foamable composition to the extent that some appear on the surface of the material. the pigment composition may be printed on to selected areas of the substrate and then the foamable composition may be applied as an overall coating. alternatively, if the foamable composition is applied only to some of the areas to which the pigment composition has been applied (whether or not the pigment composition had been applied overall), the foam areas above the migratory pigment bearing areas of the substrate will be depicted in a colour or tone contrasting to that of those areas where the pigment composition, but not the foam composition, had been applied. both the migratory pigment composition and the foam composition may be applied as overall coatings with the foam composition varying in thickness, such as by applying a foamable composition of varying thickness or by using a chemical embossing technique or coating on to a pre einbossed substrate. the valleys regions of the foamed material will then exhibit a deeper colouration than the peaks. the a:roilnt ox migratory pigment, in the areas to which the migratory pigment composition
