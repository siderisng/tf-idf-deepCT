<ABSTRACT>
a power transmission v-belt comprises a layer of tensile  members (1) extending longitudinally of the belt and  embedded between a compression section (3) and a tension  section (2) disposed respectivoly inwardly and outwardly of  the tensile member layer (1), the tension and compression  sections each including a rubber layer in which are embedded  short fibres (6) extending transversely of the belt.  bonded to  an outward surface of the tension section (2) and/or  embedded in an inward portion (3â€²) of the compression  section (3) is at least one ply of rubbered fabric (4) woven in  plain or twill weave from crimped nylon yarns (4a) subjected  to wooly treatment which are high in stretchability and which  extend generally longitudinally of the belt and cotton yarns.   nylon yarns or polyester yarns (40) which are high in rigidity  and which extend transversely of the belt.  the belt is thus  made longitudinally flexible but laterally rigid.  the rubber  layer and short fibres in the tension section (2) can be omitted,  and instead at least one ply of rubbered fabric (5) can be  bonded in lamination to an outward surface of the tensile  member layer (1).
