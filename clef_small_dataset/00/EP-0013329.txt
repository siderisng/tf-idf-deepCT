<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for transmitting data which are present in the form of a transmitting-end binary signal (a) and which by means of a frequency-modulated signal are transmitted to the receiving end, where following a demodulation, a receving-end binary signal (n) is produced, characterized in that the transmitting-end binary signal (a) is converted into a digital coded signal (h), whose spectrum does not include the frequency zero, that the frequency-modulated signal (i) is produced from the digital coded signal (h), that a demodulated signal (l) is obtained from the received frequency-modulated signal (i), from the spectrum of which demodulated signal the frequency zero is eliminated and a demodulated signal (l') which is restricted in terms of frequency is produced, and that the receiving-end binary signal (n) is produced from the amplitudes of the demodulated signal (l') which is restricted in terms of frequency (fig.  3 and 4).
