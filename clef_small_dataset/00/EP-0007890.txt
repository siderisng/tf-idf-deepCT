<ABSTRACT>
a method for manufacturing and refining crude lead from  arsenic-containing lead raw-materials of a metallic, oxidic,  sulphatic or sulphidic nature.  in the manufacture of said crude  lead, the lead raw-material is melted in a furnace in which  strong turbulence can be created in the contents thereof, in  the presence of a slag former, whereafter the slag is tapped-­ off.  the furnace used is preferably a top blown rotary conver­ ter or a furnace of the kaldo-type.  the invention is characteri­ zed in that iron in metallic finely-divided form, such as iron  filings, iron powder or finely-divided pieces of iron, is charged  to the crude-lead melt whilst creating strong turbulence the­ rein, or said iron is caused to be formed in situ, preferably by  adding silicon, silicides, carbon, carbides or ferro-alloys con­ taining carbon and silicon, wherewith arsenic and any anti­ mony present form an iron speiss which is separated from the  crude-lead melt in liquid form in direct conjunction with a  gravitational separation of speiss and crude lead.  any copper  present in the melt can be segregated therefrom as metallic  copper or a copper speiss, by cooling the crude-lead melt.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of manufacturing and refining crude lead from arsenic-containing lead rau-materials. although metallic lead is normally produced from sulphidic lead rau-materials, such as concentrates1 it is also produced from metallic1 oxidic and sulphatic lead rau-materials, such as dust, ashes and slags. the most common furnace for smelting and reducing lead is the shaft furnace, uhich is charged with lead rau-materias which may have been pre-sintered or roasted to oxidize the sulphidic sulphur uith atmospheric oxygen to a content of less than 2% sulphidic sulphur. this smelting and reduction of lead raw-material can also be effected to advantage in a rotary, inclined furnace, such as a furnace of the kaldo-type as described in suedish patent specifications 7317217-3 and 7317219-9, which illustrate processes for producing crude lead from sulphidic and from oxidic and sulphatic lead rau materials. by crude lead is meant here,generally,a lead product which must be subjected to further purifying or refining stages, in order to be retailed as a normal market product. when producing crude lead from different raw materials the lead uill thus practically always contain impurities undesirable in the finished lead. examples of such impurities include copper, arsenic and antimony. the crude lead will normally also contain gold and silver. thus, irrespective of the method by which it is produced, crude lead must always be refined in order to obtain a sufficiently pure lead, commercially known as a so-called refined lead. normally, the lead is refined in various chambers or pots specifically designed for such refining work. the copper, and above all the arsenic, present in the crude lead create a particular problem when refining said lead, since these impurities may reach to 15% or, in certain cases, even higher, which give very large quantities of more or less solid powderous products, normally called dross, on the surface of the metal bath, thereby rendering handling difficult. further, the arsenic represents a direct threat to the environment, since a significant amount thereof is fumed-off from the pots or chambers during the refining process. thus, it is highly desirable to remove arsenic and copper from the crude lead to the greatest extent possible , before the lead passes to the final refining stage,to be formed into a commercial lead product. crude lead from shaft furnaces, which are tapped at about 1000-1100 c,can contain the aforementioned impurities , present in the lead raw-material, in quantities which,in the case of copper, correspond to the solubility limit in lead , which is about 10% at 11000c , and in respect of arsenic correspond to the amount of arsenic present in the lead - raw-material with the exception of that uhich is fumed-off during the smelting process. at the temperatures in question, arsenic is soluble in lead to an unlimited degree. for the purpose of avoiding the aforementioned problem, a method has been proposed in swedish patent specificatioh number 7317218-1 in which crude lead is recovered by smelting and reducing oxidic and/or sulphatic products in a rotatable converter, in which the major
