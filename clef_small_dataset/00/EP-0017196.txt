<ABSTRACT>
radio apparatus and in particular vhf transmitter and  receiver apparatus for aeronautical use comprises a frequen­ cy synthesiser (17) which is able to generate any desired  frequency within the range of the radio and a number of  frequency channel selection devices.  these selection devices  include a channel tuning switch (11, 11′) which is arranged  on the front panel of the apparatus and which can be  adjusted to select any desired channel within the frequency  range of the radio and a number of channel selectors (12, 12′;  13, 13′; 14, 14′) which can be preset to call up certain fixed  channels as desired.  a changeover switch (16a) at the front  panel of the apparatus makes it possible to select any one of  the channel selectors (12, 12′; 13, 13′; 14, 14′) or the channel  tuning switch (11, 11′).  all the channel tuning devices are of  similar construction and are mechanical stepping switches  but the adjacent devices for the fixed channel selectors can  only be actuated by means of tools.  the selected channel is  indicated on a liquid crystal display (18).
