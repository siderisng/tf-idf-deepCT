<ABSTRACT>
a machine for picking up natural seeds from a mass of a  seeds and depositing the seeds individually comprises a row  of suction heads (13) each having a suction duct (28) terminat­ ing in an orifice and a container (18) for holding the mass of  seeds (30).  the row of heads are pivotally mounted (16) and  are provided with a driving mechanism (80, 82, 83) which  swings the heads to and fro along a path (17) between a  pick-up position in which each of the orifices is adjacent the  container and a discharge position in which seeds picked up  by suction through the orifices, are discharged.  in order to  enable each head to discharge at the discharge position only a  single natural seed rather than a pelleted seed, a wiper  member (32) is provided and extends parallel to the row of the  heads in their path between the pick-up position and the  discharge position.  the wiper member (32) has a curved sur­ face (31) and the heads swing close to this surface just before  they reach the discharge position.  the surface is so shaped  that a tapering space is formed between the surface and a flat  circular surface surrounding the orifice of each head and this  tapering space is of sufficient width to hold a single seeds, but  squeezes surplus seeds away from the orifice of each head as  the orifice passes over the curved surface.  preferably means  (45) are provided for applying air pressure to the duct of each  head when the head reaches the discharge position to blow  the seed held by the orifice from the head and discharge it into  a discharge chute (21,22).
