<ABSTRACT>
a control valve device for a pneumatically operated ser足 vomotor with two chambers separated by a movable wall,  said valve device controlling the fluid communication be足 tween said chambers and between one of them and a source  of fluid under pressure so as to establish a pressure differen足 tial across said movable wall in response to an input force; the valve device according to the invention includes a  plunger (70) which moves from a rest position to a working  position under the action of the input force, a resilient disc  (60) with a normally opened passage (62) therethrough which  gets sealed when said disc is compressed by the plunger, and  a resilient membran (88) with normally closed slits (94) there足 in which get open when said membran is stretched by the  plunger as the latter moves;   for use primarily in power brake boosters for automotive  vehicles.
