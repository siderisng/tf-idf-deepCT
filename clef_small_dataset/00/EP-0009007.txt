<ABSTRACT>
A carbon fiber-reinforced plastic pipe (1) is provided at its two ends with connecting fittings (4) for torque introduction by means of single and adhered sleeves (2,3), which are supported by radial bolts (5) in the pipe ends. The carbon reinforcing fibers are oriented for the purpose of achieving a high E module in the longitudinal direction at the same time high torsion and stiffness under a winding angle (α) of ± 10 - ± 20 °, preferably ± 12 - ± 14 ° to the pipe axis (A). To achieve a relatively high content of versicular fibers of 60-70 vol. %, during the manufacture of the tube, as long as the plastic is still flowable, a circumferential winding from the carbon fibers of solid material, in particular polyester or polyamide fibers or fabric, are applied under voltage. This circumferential winding presters excess plastic from the fiber plastic structure, but due to its relative elasticity itself practically nothing to strengthens the tube. The special orientation of the reinforcing fibers in conjunction with the high fiber content makes the pipe particularly suitable for use as a drive shaft for motor vehicles.
