<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for loading a single sheet of x-ray film into a  cassette, from a plastic lighttight envelope containing a stack  of such sheets, all in a daylight environment.  a receiver for  holding the envelope containing the sheets includes a clip at  the top that holds one end of the envelope and a groove at the  bottom into which the lower end of the envelope can be laid.  a  rod lies in the groove over the envelope, so that when the  lower envelope end is cut, no light leaks in.  however, when  the receiver is placed on a dispenser, the rod can be withdrawn  from outside the receiver to open the envelope and  allow the stack of film to fall out into the dispenser which can  feed one sheet at a time into the cassette.  the cassette lies in a  pivotally mounted cassette-holding housing that has a light  seal at the top so that, when the housing pivots under the  dispenser, the apparatus is sealed against light and, when the  housing pivots away from the dispenser, the cassette can pop  up and be withdrawn through the top of the housing.
