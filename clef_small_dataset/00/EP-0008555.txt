<ABSTRACT>
1.  assembly system for making frameworks and light metal constructions, comprising hollow shaped pieces (1) which are provided on each of their faces with a dovetail profile (3), and pincer-shaped assembly elements (11) intended to grip the dovetail profiles (3) for assembly by applying themselves on the two sides of such a dovetail profile (3), these pincers being supported by an assembly piece (4), one stem-shaped end (8) of which can fit into the inner cavity of another element or shaped piece (1) of the framework or of the construction, characterized in that this stem (8) supports a coupling lug (5), on either side of which the pincers (11) effecting the assembly with a shaped piece are gripped by means of a bolt (16) or a similar element, these pincers being adjustable in relation to this coupling lug about the axis of this bolt so as to permit assembly between the shaped pieces in any angular relationship desired.
