<ABSTRACT>
process of producing vinyl polymers by an inversion  polymerization technique in the presence of a coating on  the internal surfaces of the polymerization reactor.  by inversion  polymerization is meant conducting the initial stage  of the polymerization reaction wherein the monomer or  monomers being polymerized constitute the continuous  phase and, in the latter stage of polymerization, water constitutes  the continuous phase.  the coating is comprised of  a water-soluble suspending agent, such as an alkyl or alkyl  hydroxyalkyl cellulose ether.  by means of this process, polymer  buildup on the internal surfaces of the reactor is reduced.
