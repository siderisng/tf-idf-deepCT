<ABSTRACT>
a filter fabric is knitted from crimped synthetic multifilament  yarn (40) having a denier in the range from 70 to 300.   the yarn is knitted into courses having from about 8 to 13  stitches per centimeter.  certain yarns are knitted into stitches  defining a ground (g) and others are knitted into terry loops  (t) extending from the ground to a height of about 0. 5 to 4  millimeters.  the stitches in the ground define open areas in  the range from about 1 to 100 microns.  a method of making  this filter fabric and apparatus utilising filter devices made  from such fabric are also described.
