<ABSTRACT>
According to the filtration method, wastewater or the slurry accumulating in the cleaning of the wastewater is introduced into the open end of a semipermeter material sealed on one-sided tubular material under pressure, the filter being continuously or gradually being filled by its closed end in the direction of its outward end . The filling speed is controlled depending on the desired solids content of the concentrated. As a tubular filter, a gathered hose is used in particular. Further, VORGECH files are made to produce the filter immediately before filling by spirally shaped winding a band. The arrangement for carrying out this method consists of a För device (13) with a filling tube (14) for introducing the wastewater under pressure and a hose-formal fil Ter (16) made of semipermeably material whose one end is closed and the open with its other open End with the filling tube for receiving the wastewater is connected from the Fül l tube. In a preferred embodiment, the filled filter hose is supported by further conveyors (26) and held in the desired cross-sectional shape.
