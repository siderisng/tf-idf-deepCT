<ABSTRACT>
the polycrystalline body of the invention can be pro­ duced in a variety of configurations and a wide range of sizes  of predetermined shape and dimensions.  the shaped polycrystalline body is comprised of a mass of  crystals selected from the group consisting of diamond, cubic  boron nitride and combinations thereof adherently bonded  together by a bonding medium comprised of silicon carbide  and elemental silicon wherein the volume of said silicon car­ bide and said silicon each is at least about 1% by volume of  said polycrystalline body, said crystals ranging in size from  submicron up to about 2000 microns, the volume of said  crystals ranging from about 1 % by volume to about but less  than 80 % by volume of said body, said bonding medium  being present in an amount ranging up to about 99 % by  volume of said body, said bonding medium being distributed  at least substantially uniformly throughout said body, the  portion of said bonding medium in contact with the surface of  said crystals being silicon carbide, said body being at least  substantially pore free.  it is useful as an abrasive a cutting tool, nozzle or other  wear-resistant part.
