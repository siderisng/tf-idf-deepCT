<ABSTRACT>
lubricating compositions and shaped articles composed  thereof for use in bearings and the like are described which  consist essentially of about 50 to about 90% by weight of an oil  of lubricating viscosity and about 50 to about 10% by weight  of polymethylpentene having an average molecular weight in  the range from about 3 to about 5 million; the oil being a  mineral oil, a diester oil or preferably a synthetic hydrocarbon  oil, and having a viscosity in the range from about 15 to about  300 millimetres²/second (mm²/s) at 38°c (100°f); the shaped  articles can be formed in situ in an article such as a bearing or  a mold by heat curing a physical mixture of the oil and  polymethylpentene at a temperature somewhat above the  initial softening point of the latter for about 45 to 75 minutes  and allowing the mixture to cool to form a firm, tough, solid  gel having an oily surface provided by oil exuding from the gel  to thus produce a lubricating mass operable for extended  periods of time at temperature up to about 160°c (320°f).   these shaped lubricating masses may be used as formed or  may be shaped further by conventional physical means.
