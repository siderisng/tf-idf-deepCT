<ABSTRACT>
a method and an apparatus for transporting items such  as chopped nuclear fuel pins from a receiving station to a  discharge station.  the apparatus contains a liquid (25) for  transporting the items in an inlet duct (12, 35, 56, 71) which  extends downwardly from the receiving station to a region  (11, 37, 58, 75) where it is joined to an outlet duct (13, 36, 57,  77) which extends upwardly to the discharge station.  the region (11, 37, 38, 75) is connected to a source (27)  capable of applying a pressure pulse to the liquid (25) so as  to displace the liquid (25) upwardly in at least the outlet duct  (13, 36, 57, 77) and thereby transport the items through the  apparatus.  at least two apparatus may be connected together in  series relationship to provide a plant for the transport of the  items through the plant.
