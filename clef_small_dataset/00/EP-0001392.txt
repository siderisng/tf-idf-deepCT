<ABSTRACT>
during the delivery of low-boiling liquefied gases in pipelines, a two-phase flow of gas and liquid forms, since some gas constantly vaporises through the incidence of heat.  the vaporised gas can be separated in phase separators which essentially consist of an insulated container (1) having a feed line (3) for the low-boiling liquefied gas and discharge lines (10, 12) for the separated gaseous and remaining liquid gas.  the liquid phase occurs here in liquid droplets of the most varied size.  the smaller drops are partly entrained with the gas phase, which is tantamount to a loss of liquid phase.  the insulated containers are therefore designed to be as large as possible in order to achieve low gas velocities.  a large type of construction of the insulated containers is avoided by the feed line for the low-boiling liquefied gas in the container leading into a porous hollow body (4).  liquid comes out of the porous hollow body in the form of uniform, large drops.  <image>
