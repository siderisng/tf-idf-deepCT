<ABSTRACT>
a crack inducing and sealing strip for insertion into  wet slabs of concrete to provide a crack inducer and a seal  for the induced crack in the set concrete, the strip being  extruded from resiliently deformable elastomeric materials  and comprising a hollow member having a pair of spaced  side walls (1 and 3), a top wall (5) and a base (7) which  is preferably enlarged, there being a keying ridge (13)  projecting laterally from each side wall approximately mid­ way between the top and bottom of the walls and the strip  preferably also including laterally projecting flanges (17)  at its upper end.  the keying ridges may be formed of softer  material in which case lines of weakness may also be provid­ ed in the side walls formed by the softer material from which  the keying ridges are formed.
