<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a solid flocculating agent  comprising at least two components, of which one is  aluminium sulphate comprising approximately al₂(so₄)3.   (12-18)h₂o and the other is an inorganic alkaline compound.   the aluminium sulphate and the alkaline compound have  such proportions that the ratio between the sum of moles of  oh and oh equivalents present in the alkaline compound  and the number of moles of aluminium present in the  aluminium sulphate is the highest possible but not substantially  exceeding a value determined by a specified graph,  whereby the flocculating agent when dissolved in water in a  concentration range of 0 02 2 0 moles al 1 gives a clear  solution with a high content of multi-nuclei aluminium-hydroxide  complexes the invention also relates to a method of producing such  an agent, in which an aluminium-sulphate raw material and  inorganic alkaline compound(s) are combined in the presence  of water in an amount so that a ratio, dust-free  composition is provided.  the components may be combined  in different ways, but it is preferred to mechanically compact  an intimate mixture of the components in a finely-divided  form and then disintegrate the compacted mass into particulate  matter.  another preferred method comtemplates the use  of a rotary furnace for producing a granular agent from  aluminium sulphate granules and a finely divided alkaline  compound in the presence of a minor quantity of water so  that the sulphate and the alkali react with each other to form  granules.

<DESCRIPTION>
a solid flocculating agent, a method for its manufacture and its use the present invention relates to a solid flocculating agent in the form of a particulate, dust-free composition comprising at least two components, of which one is aluminium sulphate and the other is an inorganic alkaline compound. the alkaline compound is selected from the group consisting of hydroxides, carbonates and hydrocarbonates of alkali iiietals, preferably potassium and sodium, and oxides, hydroxidcs and cartlollates of alkaline earth metals, preferably#cal- tium and nlagresiunl. the invention also relates to a method of manufacturing said flocculating agent, and also to its use, for example, for purifying water. solid flocculating agents comprising aluminium sulphate and an alkaline compound are known. thus, in us-a 932795 aluminium sulphate and sodium carbonate are used either separately or mixed or in form of solutions. the proportions of the components should then be selected so as to not substantially affect the alkalinity of the liquid to be purified. us-a 2 354 146 refers to use of an agglomerated composition also comprising starch. the composition is added after the liquid has been alkalinized and the proportions between the aluminium sulphate and the alkaline compound in the composition is substantially 1:1. use of solid basic aluminium sulphates as flocculating agents is described in us-a 1 197123 and 1 643 962. earlier tests have shown that aluminium sulphate solutions used for flocculation of water, de-watering vegetable matter, sizing paper etc., can be given an increased efficiency by elevating the ph of the solutions. these findings are described in our earlier european patent publication ep-al 00005419. when adding alkali to an aluminium sulphate solution, its ph is raised and aluminium - hydroxide complex ions are formed. these complex ions comprise partly the single nucleus a1(oh)2+ and al(oh)+2 and partly the multi-nuclei which can be represented by the formula al m (oh)n (3m-n)+: in this formula m and n can take varying values and in general the ratio n/m lies within the range of 2.3 to 2.7. although it is difficult to exactly determine the configuration of the multi nuclei complex, it would appear that, in all events, the 4+ complex a18(oh)20 4+, is present in, significant quantities in the aluminium sulphate solutions in question. the aforementioned patent application describes, in more detail, the conditions in such aluminium sulphate solutions containing multi nuclei complexes. when the alkalisation process is carried out in a suitable manner to a suitable ph value, the highest possible content of multi-nuclei complex is obtained, which is desirable with respect to the efficiency of the aluminium sulphate. ions having a high charge have a much higher coagulating effect than ions having a lower charge within the aforementioned fields of use, and this explains why alkalised aluminium-sulphate solutions are more effective than nonalkalised aluminium sulphate solutions. none of the prior art solid flocculating agents provides forming of multi-nuclei complexes and thus the flocculating efficiency when using the known solid agents are comparably low. the above mentioned aluminium sulphate solution containing multi-nuclei
