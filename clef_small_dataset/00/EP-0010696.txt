<ABSTRACT>
when a machine element (1) having a large mass is  given a reciprocating movement the recurring changes in  speed as well as direction of movement bring about that  very great driving forces must be supplied, which cause  varying stresses on the driving unit.  in case the movement  path of the machine element (1) is more or less vertical the  force of gravity causes extra stresses on the machine ele­ ment.  these difficulties are overcome in accordance with  the invention by the help of a spring system (11) which on  the one hand equalizes the effect of the force of gravity on  the machine element (1), on the other hand compensates  the arising mass forces by absorbing, storing and emitting  energy following the movement of the machine element (1).   hereby the amount of applied driving force is reduced, so  that shocks and vibrations occurring during the driving are  effectively reduced.
