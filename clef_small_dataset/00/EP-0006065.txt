<ABSTRACT>
a corrosion inhibitor composition and a method for its use in potable and industrial water treatment facilities for controlling corrosion encountered in water distribution systems such as turbine pump blades, the main distribution piping, their tributaries, and domestic and industrial piping comprises a weight ratio of po4 identical  to zn# of about 2:1 to 3:1.  when added to the raw water intake or other suitable point in small but effective quantities, it passivates metal surfaces.  the inhibitor is effective within a ph range of about 5-9 but is especially effective in waters having a ph of 6. 5-8.
