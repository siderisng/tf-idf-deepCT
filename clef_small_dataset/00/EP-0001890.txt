<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure relates to the packaging of microwave  integrated circuits (mics) whereby an mic is hermetically  sealed within an enclosure comprising a first plate (10) of  dielectric material which carries the circuit to be enclosed, a  wall (3) of dielectric material sealed to the surface of the first  plate surrounding the circuit, and a second plate (4) of dielectric  material providing a lid sealed over the wall to complete  the enclosure.  the first plate carries planar conductors  (13, 15) which define at least one microwave transmission  line, eg microstrip, extending across the wall into the enclosure  from outside to provide direct microwave coupling to the  enclosed circuit and thereby obviating the usual need for  transistions to and from coaxial cable.  part or all of the enclosed circuit may be contained  within a recess (2) provided by forming an aperture in the  first plate (10) and sealing a third plate (9) of dielectric material  across the aperture from below.
