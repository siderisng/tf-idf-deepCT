<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to high power gear transmissions  such as may be used in marine applications.  the gear transmission  is reversible and utilises an epicyclic construction  involving sun, planet and annulus gears and including a first  coupling (9, 10) which in an engaged condition makes the  annulus gear support member (5) rotationally fast with the  input shaft (1), and a second coupling (13, 14) which in an  engaged condition locks the planet gear carrier (12) against  rotation.  the transmission has two operative conditions, a  first in which the first coupling is engaged and the second  coupling disengaged, and a second in which the second coupling  is engaged and the first coupling disengaged so that for  a single direction of rotation of the input shaft the output shaft  can be rotated in either direction.
