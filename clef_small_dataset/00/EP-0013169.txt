<ABSTRACT>
in an improved combing roller provided with a matallic  wire (8) mounted on a body (5) thereof comprising a main  cylindrical body (5a) and a pair of flanges coaxially formed at  both ends of the main cylindrical body (5b,5c) a base portion  of the metallic wire (8) rigidly pressed into a right hand or a left  hand helical groove formed in the main body and the working  direction of the metallic wire coincide with the rotational  direction of the combing roller, if one of the flanges (5b, 5c) on a  side of the combing roller corresponding to the direction of  progress of an imaginary right hand screw imaginarily  engaged with the above-mentioned right hand helical groove  or an imaginary left hand screw imaginarily engaged with the  above-mentioned left hand helical groove when the imagiÂ­ nary screws are tuned in the direction corresponding to the  rotational direction of the combing roller, is defined as a first  flange, while the other flange is defined as a second flange,  the axial size (l1) of the free cylindrical space formed at the  side of the first flange (5b) is smaller than the axial size (l2) of  the free cylindrical space formed at the side of the second  flange (5c).

<DESCRIPTION>
an improvement of a combing roller utilized for an open-end spinning machine summary of the invention the present invention relates to a combing roller utilized for an open-end spinning machine and, more particularly, relates to an improved combing roller wherein the roller is provided with a metallic wire mounted on the peripheral surface thereof without a free space where fibers can not receive effective combing action. background of the invention in a known embodiment of the open-end spinning machine, a bundle of fibers supplied from an upstream supplying mechanism is opened by means of a combing roller, so as to separate the bundle into individual fibers, and the separated fibers are carried into a twisting mechanism so as to form a twisted yarn. in such an open-end machine, a combing roller provided with a metallic wire helically secured on the peripheral surface of the main body of the combing roller is utilized. it is well known that the above mentioned metallic wire is provided with a cross-section comprising a laterally expanded base portion and a teeth portion projected upward from the base portion. when the metallic wire is mounted on the peripheral surface of the main body of the combing roller, the base portion of the metallic wire is pressed into a helical groove formed on the peripheral portion of the main body of the combing roller by means of a press roller, so that the metallic wire can be rigidly mounted on the main body of the combing roller. to attain an effective action of the combing roller, the helical groove is formed on the peripheral portion of the main body with a pertinent pitch along the axial direction of the combing roller. it is well known that the main body is coaxially provided with a flange at each end thereof. therefore, in such a combing roller, cylindrical spaces are formed on the peripheral portion of the main body between the two flanges and the corresponding spiral portions of the metallic wire, which are the starting and terminal portions of the metallic wire. the axial size of those cylindrical spaces has been allowed to be almost the same as the above-mentioned pitch of the helical groove, that is the axial pitch of the metallic wire. it is the understanding of the inventors of the present invention that the reasons for the above-mentioned axial size of those cylindrial space are as follows. first since the mounting of the metallic wire on the main body of the combing roller is carried out by pressing the shoulder of the base portion of the metallic wire into the helical groove of the main body by means of a pressing disc having a certain thickness, it is necessary to have a space for carrying out the pressing operation when the pressing operation is carried out on the portions of the wire closest to the above -mentioned flanges, and; second, it is not recognized that the cylindrical spaces at the two end portions of the
