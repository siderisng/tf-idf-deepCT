<ABSTRACT>
phosphorus rich transition metal alloys are protected by a  layer of boron oxide during the melting process.  the presence  of the boron oxide layer prevents the evaporation of phos­ phorus values.  melting of phosphorus-containing iron/nic­ kel/cobalt based glass-forming alloys under a refining metal  oxide/boron trioxide flux reduces undesirable metal oxide  impurities, such as titanium dioxide impurities, prevents oxi­ dation of the melt, and reduces loss of phosphorus values  from the melt.

<DESCRIPTION>
description preparation of phosphorus-containing metallic glass-forming alloy melts background of the invention recent advances in the metallurgical arts include development of alloys which, when rapidly quenched from the melt at rates in excess of about 104 to 1060c per second, form glassy (amorphous) solids. such glassforming alloys commonly are based on transition metals, usually iron, nickel and/or cobalt, in conjunction with one or more metalloids of phosphorus, boron and carbon. glass-forming alloys are, for example, described in u.s. pat. 3,856,513 issued december 24, 1974 to chen et al. preparation of phosphide based melts of glassforming alloys under ambient atmosphere leads to oxide inclusions in the glassy metal product. the conventional method of excluding the ambient atmosphere by vacuum melting leads to possible losses of phosphorus values from the melt due to evaporation. iron phosphide is a basic ingredient in many glass-forming metallic alloy compositions, and in the high purity form required for such purpose, it is quite costly. inexpensive forms of iron phosphide available are impure and contain phosphorus in form which can evaporate upon heating, and which tends to form volatile phosphorus pentoxide, and which poses a safety hazard and results in changes of the alloy composition. glassy solid structures are obtained from such alloys by processes such as the melt spin process wherein a fine jet of the molten alloy is impinged upon a rapidly moving chill surface for solidification. orifice diameters in this process are exceedingly small, and orifice pluggage on account of solid impurities contained in the melt can represent serious problems. iron, cobalt or nickel based phosphorus-containing glass-forming alloys which additionally contain boron as a metalloid are particularly prone to contamination with solid particles. in such alloy, these particles were found to be predominantly small particles of tio2 and/or tibo3, both of which have high melt points, and both of which are relatively insoluble in the melt. it was found that titanium is an impurity commonly contained in ferrophosphorus, which is used as a source of phosphorus in making these alloys, although titanium may also be present as contaminant in other raw materials employed in making these alloys. the present invention provides refining flux for reducing oxidation of and loss of phosphorus values from phosphorus-containing alloys, especially phosphorus-containing iron, nickel and/or cobalt-based alloys. summary of the invention phosphorus-containing metallic glass-forming alloy melts are covered with a layer of molten boron trioxide flux. such layer protects the melt from oxidation, dissolves oxide particulates and impurities from the molten metal alloy and prevents the evaporation of phosphorus values. the flux floating on the alloy melt will not interfere with subsequent casting or spinning operations, and the alloy melt can be replenished directly through the flux layer. alloys prepared according to the process of the present invention leave minimum residues in the jetting crucible in subsequent melt spin operations. phosphorus-containing iron, nickel and/or cobaltbased alloys are desirably melted under a boron trioxide flux additionally comprising oxides of iron, nickel and/or cobalt. the flux layer protects the molten alloy
