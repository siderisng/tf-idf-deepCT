<ABSTRACT>
In the process for producing a thin film structure, on a substrate (2), a first and two thin film (4,6), which differ in their etching properties, and a radiation-sensitive paint layer (7) is applied. In the paint layer (7) and in the thin film (6), openings (9, 10) are generated. With the thin film (6) as a mask is etched under conditions in which the thin film (4) is attacked. without the thin film (6) is previously removed, the method steps are repeated at least once from the application of a thin film to its etching with the thin film located above, with regard to the etching chimes the first thin film (14) applied in a repetition The last prior to this repetition brought thin film (6) and the second thin film (16) applied to a redthea lung (16) equal to the second last thin film (4) applied in front of the ser repetition. The method is suitable for producing metalli sizing structures with conductor train patterns in several Lei Tend interconnected, superimposed planes.
