<ABSTRACT>
in a method of making a shaped structure from sheet  material comprising reinforcing elements such as fibres  bonded together by a thermosetting resin, said sheet  material is formed into a shaped structure by pneumatic  pressure applied to it by a flexible substantially air-­ impervious film (1), preferably of cast, extruded or calen­ dered thermoplastic material, while it is enclosed between  that film and a second flexible film (5).  the method is  specially applicable to the moulding of carbon-fibre-­ reinforced sheets (2,3,4) into laminated structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of making a shaped structure this invention relates to a method of making a shaped structure from sheet material comprising reinforcing elements, particularly but not exclusively fibres, bonded together by a thermosetting resin. the moulding of resin-bonded fibre-reinforced material that is essentially two-dimensional into a form having three dimensions is at present usually carried out by what is known as 'hand lay-up'. in this procedure, the sheet - for example, polyester resin/glass fibre reinforced mat or epoxy resin impregnated carbon fibre sheet - has first to be cut into suitably shaped pieces to conform to the configuration of the forming mould. this operation is very difficult to repeat accurately, and accordingly important properties of the moulded product, such as modulus and strength, are difficult to obtain consistently. by the method of the present invention, a much higher degree of reproducibility can be obtained in the properties of products moulded from fibre-reinforced and like sheet material. the method is related to the well known procedure of vacuum forming, whose principles are described in plastics and rubber weekly, 25th february 1972. that method is, however, not ordinarily applicable to the moulding of sheet material which is porous at the operating temperature, as for example carbon-fibre sheet is. according to the invention, there is provided a method of making a shaped structure from sheet material comprising reinforcing elements bonded together by a thermosetting resin, in which said material is formed into a shaped structure by pneumatic pressure applied to it by a flexible substantially air-impervious film while it is enclosed between that film and a second flexible film. of the two flexible films employed in the method of the invention, the first (air-impervious) film is that by which pneumatic pressure is transmitted to the sheet material; the second film lies between the sheet material and the surface of whatever mould the sheet material is to be made to conform to. the two films conveniently form an envelope sealed at its periphery enclosing the sheet material. the second film maybe air-impervious, like the first; or it may be permeable to air, as described later. the flexible substantially air-impervious film is suitably of thermoplastic material, for example a ca3t, extruded or calendered film of thermoplastic material; and the second film may likewise be a cast, extruded or calendered film of thermoplastics material. preberably, at least two sheets of the sheet material laid one upon the other, are formed into a shaped laminar structure by said pneumatic pressure. during shaping of the sheet material, the thermosetting resin component of it may require to be softened by heat. the method is specially valuable in its application to the moulding of sheets of directionally orientated reinforcing fibre, particularly unidirectionally oriented carbon fibre sheet or glass fibre sheet and bi-directionally oriented glass fibre sheet (such as sheet made from woven glass roving). thus, by assembling sheets of unidirectionally oriented fibre one upon the other so that the fibres in one sheet are inclined to those in the other,
