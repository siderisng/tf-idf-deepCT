<ABSTRACT>
gemstones are cut such that the pavillion facets are  curved facets (12, 14, 16) and are arranged in pairs around the  pavillion and so disposed relative to each other and the crown  and table of the gemstone that light entering the stone through  the crown and meeting the first curved facet of a pair is conÂ­ verged and reflected on to a second curved facet of that pair  from which it is reflected to the crown, faceting machine for  producing such facets is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
clotting gemstones this invention concerns gemstones, a method of cutting andyor polishing the same to improve their brilliance and a facet-ing machine for enabling the method to be carried out. gem cutters use standard cuts to achieve brilliance depending upon the shape of the uncut gemstone. hitherto the facets of gemstones have been flat and the standard cuts cause incident light to be brought to a focus either within the stone or a short distance above the crown of the stone and consequently the full possibilities of brilliance are not realised. terms used for parts of the gemstone are standard and are, the crown (the portion of the stone above the girdle), the girdle (the peripheral line of greatest dimension), the table (the flat upper portion of the stone normally viewed through which light enters and leaves the stone), the pavillion (the bulky portion of the stone below the girdle in which is liberally faceted to achieve light reflection), and the culet (the lower most portion of the pavillion). this invention provides a gemstone having a crown portion which tapers from a girdle and pavillion portion tapering from the opposite direction to the crown and terminating in a culet and facets on the pavillion characterised in that each facet of the pavillion is a curved facet which term includes a single surface which is part of a cone or one c1. is curved in a first direction and flat it the direction substantially at 90 to the first direction or is a series of smaller flat surfaces the lateral extremities of which die on the arc of a circle or the surface of the sphere or ellipsoid, and in that the curved facets are arranged in pairs and are so disposed relative to each other and the crown and table that light entering the stone through the crown and meeting the first curved facet of a pair is converged and reflected onto the second curved facet of that pair from which it is reflected to the crown of the gemstone. the pavillion may have ring of circumferential curved facets adjacent the table, a ring of circumferential curved facets at the culet and one or more further rings ol circumferential curved facets between the table ring and the culet ring, each ring defining a plane which is parallel to the table, all the facets of the same ring subtending the same angle with reference to the plane of the table and each successive ring @ the he direction from the table to the culet subtending a successively diminishing acute angle with the plane table whereby light which enters the crown, perpendicularly to the table undergoes a reflection at both curved facets of a pair and is reflected toward the eye of an observer in a direction at substantially perpendicular to the crown. each curved facet of each pair of curved facets is arranged equally about an axis of symmetry of gemstone. alternatively, the pairs of curved facets are disposed in common

    claims         1.    a   gemstone    having a   crown    portion which tapers from a girdle and a   pavillion    portion tapering from the opposite direction to the crown and terminating in a culet, facets on the pavillion characterised in that each facet of the pavillion is a curved facet which term includes a single surface   which    is part of a cone or one which is curved in a first direction and flat in the direction at substantially 900 to the first direction or is a series of smaller flat surfaces the lateral extremities of which lie on the arc of a circle or the surface of a sphere or ellipsoi   @    and in that the curved facets are arranged   in    pairs   arc    are so disposed relative   to     <rti     id=8.11> eacr      other    and the gemstone   crown    and table   tat    light entering the gemstone through the crown and meeting the first curved facet of a pair is converged and reflected onto   the    second curved facet of that pair from which it is reflected to the crown of the gemstone.   2. a   gem3tcrc-'    as claimed in claim   l    having a pavillion defined by a ring of   circle    erential curved facets adjacent the table, a ring of circumferential curved facets at the culet and one or more further   ris    of circumferential curved acets between the table ring and the culet ring each ring   defi a    plane which is parallel to the table, all the facets of the sane ring subtending the same angle with reference to the   plane    of the table and each successive ring in the   direct@      -    from the table to the culet subtending   a-suc-cessive    diminishing acute angle with the plane of the table whereby light   which    enters the crown,  perpendicularly' to the table undergoes a reflection at both curved facets of a pair and is reflected towards the eye of an observer in a direction substantially perpendicular to   i-e,    crown.   3 a gemstone as   claimed    in   claim    1 or 2, wherein   each    curved facet of each pair of   curved    facets is arranged equally about an   axis    of symmetry of the gemstone  4. a genstone   as    claimed in claim 1 or 2,   wherein    the   pairs    of   urved      facets      are    disposed in a common plane at an angle to one another.   5. a gemstone as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the radius of the curved   acts    in the   pavlllion    is of the order of the distance of travel of a light ray   fro    a   first    incidence upon one facet to a second incidence upon a paired facet in a plane parallel to the table.   6. a gemstone as claimed in claim 5, wherein the   radius    is of the order of the maximum distance across the girdle.      7    a gemstone as   c'lained    in claim 5 or   6.    wherein the radius is such as to cause light rays converged by incidence upon   the    first curved facet of a pair to converge but not to focus and diverge within the stone before reaching the second curved facet of the pair.   8. a gemstone as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the crown is also provided   with    pairs of   curved    facets like manner to the pavillion    .      f    method of   cutting,    gemstones as   clalree      iii    claim shaping a series of paires of curved facets so that the light rays entering at or close to 90  to the table and falling on.  the first of a pair of faceted arcs are   eonccntrated    and reflected to the second of the pair of facets which in turn deflects the converged rays failing, upon it from the first facet into parallel rays   which    are reflected back to the crown, where allowing where applicable for refraction, much of the light emerges within   @    range of   vision    of an observer as a series of substantially parallel bright light   beams    in which the rays are substantially parallel.    10. a faceting machine for entting gemstones as claimed in claim 1 complising a movable lapping surface, a   ou2@d      positiv@    close to the lapping surface, a old, projecting   @lem    said quill   having means for supporting   @andt@    are : the plurality of preselected positions and a   copi@r@ sa@pert      pare@@@l, conne    at or near one end of said radius   n.
