<ABSTRACT>
a steering mechanisms for sets of wheeled axles which are fitted near the rear of semitrailers and trailers, and where these axle assemblies are each mounted on a rotary ring which can pivot with respect to the said trailer about a vertical axis, these rotary rings being subjected to a rotation when the vehicle takes a bend.  the mechanism consists mainly of a rotary element (14) capable of pivoting about a vertical axis and forming part of the front part of a semitrailer, of a means (18) for locking this element to the fixed part of the semitrailer coupling of the traction unit, of at least one hydraulic cylinder (16) applied between the frame of the semitrailer and the abovementioned rotary element (14), of at least one hydraulic cylinder (8) applied between at least one of the rotary rings (4) on which is mounted one of the axle assemblies (2-3) and the frame of the semitrailer, and of at least one line (19) connecting the front part of the said hydraulic cylinders (8-16) to each other, and a line (20) connecting the rear part of the abovementioned hydraulic cylinders (8- 16) to each other.  <image>
