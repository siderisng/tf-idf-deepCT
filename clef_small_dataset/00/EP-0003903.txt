<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides an oxygen scavenger composition  consisting essentially of   [i] as essential components,   (a) an alkali metal sulfide, and   (b) at least one oxidation promoter selected from silica,  alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia and inorganic materials  containing one of them as a main ingredient; and   [ii] as optional components,   (c) at least one oxidation promoter aid, and/or   (d) a water-insoluble or sparingly water-soluble, inert filler,  and/or   (e) water held physically or chemically in the composition.  also provided are a heat-generating composition which  is an oxygen scavenger capable of scavenging at least 5 ml  of oxygen per gram of the composition from air at 20°c during  one hour following the commencement of oxidation of  the composition and a heat-generating structure comprising  the heat-generating composition enclosed within a film having  an oxygen permeability of 0. 01 to 50 cc/cm².  min.  . 02  partial pressure (1 atm. ), the surface area of the film being 0. 2  to 10 cm² per gram of said composition.  the oxygen scavenger compositions can be used to  capture oxygen from within a closed vessel, while the heat-generating  compositions can be used to provide a required  amount of heat to an object to be heated.
