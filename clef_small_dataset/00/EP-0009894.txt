<ABSTRACT>
catalysts comprising a crystalline zeolite of constraint  index in the range of 1 to 12 are known to exhibit high  selectivity to para-substituted products and processes such  as xylene isomerisation, particularly when they manifest  certain xylene sorption characteristics.  according to the  invention this selectivity is maintained or enhanced by  regenerating such catalysts, when deactivated by deposi­ tion of coke during use, in a hydrogen - instead of an  oxygen - containing atmosphere under specified condi­ tions.

<DESCRIPTION>
regeneration of zeolite catalyst this invention relates to a method for regeneration of an aged crystalline zeolite catalysts by treatment with hydrogen under particular conditions. during the course of converting organic compounds involving reactions such as alkylation, disproportionation, isomerization, cracking, polymerization, aromatization, etc. employing a catalyst comprising a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12, a constraint index between 1 and 12 and particular xylene sorption characteristics conducive to para selectivity. it has been observed that the catalyst aged during conversion. aging has been attributed to the deposition of coke which forms during the conversion reaction and covers the active sites of the catalyst, thereby reducing its activity which in turn results in lower conversion. the usual method heretofore employed for regeneration of such catalysts to restore high product conversion has been to: (1) purge the system of organic compounds; (2) lower the temperature to about 700 f; (3) cautiously add air/nitrogen mixtures which contain about 1 percent oxygen at a rate to prevent the temperature, usually a hot zone progressing from top to bottom of the catalyst bed, from exceeding about 900 f as the coke is burned to form co and h2o; (4) enrich the oxygen concentration gradually after the bulk of the coke has been burned until it reaches a level of from about -3 to 20 percent oxygen, the latter oxygen content corresponding to air, taking care not to exceed a temperature of about 9000f; (5) purge the system with nitrogen to remove any residual oxygen; and (6) begin reaction by restoring conditions and feeds. this method requires purging the reactor before and after coke burning. it is also necessary very carefully to monitor the temperature throughout the entire catalyst bed to prevent excessive temperatures which could permanently damage and deactivate the catalyst. this method has the further disadvantage of removing all coke from the catalyst, necessitating, where desired, the re-deposition of a controlled amount of coke on the catalyst surface to impart selectivity characteristics thereto as, for example; in the selective production of paraxylene by methylation of toluene described in u.s. 4,001 ,346. a simpler, faster and more effective way to regenerate an aged crystalline zeolite catalyst of the above type has now been discovered. the method of the ivention eliminates the undesirable purging and, where desired, coke re-deposition steps necessary in the catalyst regeneration procedure heretofore employed. according to the present invention a method of regenerating a catalyst bearing a deposit of coke as a consequence of use in an organic compound conversion process, said catalyst comprising a crystalline zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12, a constraint index of 1 to 12; a xylene sorption capacity of at least 1g.l1cog. of zeolite and an o-xylene sorption time for 30 percent of said capacity greater than 10 minutes, said sorption capacity and time being measured at 1200c and a xylene pressure of 4.5 + 0.8 mm. hg, comprises exposing the catalyst to a
