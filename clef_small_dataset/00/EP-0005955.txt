<ABSTRACT>
a single field or picture of a pal colour television signal  is stored in a store and provides a signal at an input (52).  the  stored signal consists of 2fsc samples taken at 45Â° to the  u-axis.  the signal is separated by a filter (56) and subtractor  (58) into a high frequency or chrominance signal and a low  frequency or luminance signal.  the chrominance signal is  delayed by delay means (62) such that the chrominance  components of two lines which are an odd number of lines  apart are made available simultaneously.  these signals are  combined by switches (s1, s2) and/or combining circuits (68)  to provide a signal at 4fsc which is combined with the  luminance signal in a combining circuit (70) to provide a 4fsc  pal output (72).  the manner of the combination of the  chrominance components is changed on an 8-field cycle.  in  an alternative arrangement, if the pal signal is originally  stored in a store which provides outputs from more than one  line simultaneously, two stored lines can be combined, and  the chrominance portion of the thus-combined signal combined  with the luminance portion of a stored signal to  provide the output.
