<ABSTRACT>
the system is especially intended to protect commercial motor vehicles, and provides in each vehicle at least one sensor (1 min ) for instance, sensing, when activated, intrusion in or movement of the vehicle, connected to a memory (1) storing predetermined data relating to the vehicle e. g.  registration number, load being carried and intended destination.  the memory is arranged automatically to feed out the relevant data when the sensor is actuated by the intrusion or movement of the vehicle.  this data is then fed to a radio frequency modulator (2) comprising a mulitiplexer and the modulated carrier is fed to a transmitter (3).  the sensor, memory, modulator and transmitter are all provided in each vehicle.  the transmitter automatically transmits the data to a relay (8), and the relay automatically transmits to a central receiver (10) which via a demodulator demultiplexer (13) operates a v. d. u (visual display unit 14) so that appropriate action can be taken in response to the received data.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "security system" the resent invention relates to a security system for use at a plurality of fixed locations e.g. in enclosures such as buildings, or in a plurality of nobile locations such as in freight containers and on vehicles, such as notor vehicles and aircraft. machine control systems are knosm employing computers storing predetermined data and providing a read-out of such data in response to the detection by a sensor of a specified occurrence. it is also known, in data processing, toprovide for the visual display of received and stored data and to store received data which is displayed or to be displayed. security systems are also known using a plurality of sensors e.g. t.v. cameras, feeding signals to a central control station for the purpose of monitoring some given thing such as the surroundinss of the exterior of a buildings or an industrial process. alarm systems are also known which on the occurrence of a given condition e.g. an intrusion, automatic- ally provide an alarm signal. it is known in particular to provide such systems in motor vehicles and especially in goods vehicles. the present invention is based on the idea of providing at each of a plurality of locations at which security protection or monitoring is to be provided, stored infonation identifying the location, and of arranging for the stored information automatically to be transmi#-#-od to a central station on the occurrence of a specified event or events, the central station indicating reception of all transmitted information to enable appropriate action to be tciten. thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a security system which permits a large number of widely dispersed locations to be surveilledfroma central station by arranging that the surveillance is given only on demand from each location as and when the need therefor arises. this limits the attention the central station need give, to that location or those locations in respect of which some action is currently needed. the present invention provides a security system comprising a memory sited at a location to be monitored, holding predetermined data relating to the location, a sensor associated azith the memory; the memory being arranged automatically to provide a read-out of the data on actuation of the sensor in response to the occurrence of a specified event, and a remote indicator to receive a memory read-out and provide an indication of the nature thereof; wherein a transmission link is provided to transmit data read-out from the memory to the indicator; the link comprising; a data transmitter located at said location, and a receiver for transmitted data located at the site of indicator to feed data thereto. the content of the predetermined data will depend on the particular use of th√® security system. for instance, if it is to be used as an anti-theft system on a commercial vehicle, the message may provide information concerning the registration number of the vehicle, its load, its intended destination and any other fact which it is considered
