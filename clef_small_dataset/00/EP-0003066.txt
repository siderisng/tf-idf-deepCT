<ABSTRACT>
process for the preparation of meta-aryloxybenzaldehydes, especially meta-phenoxybenzaldehyde, which comprises reacting a mixture of meta-aryloxybenzyl and meta-aryloxybenzal halides with hexamethylenetetramine and hydrolysing the resulting product in the presence of a non-acidic solvent.  meta-phenoxy benzaldehyde is an important intermediate in the manufacture of a group of insecticidally-active compounds known as pyrethroids.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the preparation of meta-aryloxybenzaldehydes, and meta-aryloxybenzaldehydes produced by the process the invention relates to a process for the preparation of meta-aryloxybenzaldehydes, which compounds are valuable intermediates, for example, in the preparation of pesticides containing a meta-aryloxybenzyl group. such pesticides include meta-aryloxybenzyl esters of substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acids, which are the so-called pyrethroid insecticides having outstanding insecticidal properties (see british patent specification 1,413,491). a kndrn process for the preparation of meta-aryloxybenz- aldehydes is described in netherlands patent application 7701128, and comprises two steps, the first step consisting in the reaction of mixture of meta-aryloxybenzyl halides and meta aryloxybenzai halides with hexamethylenetetramine, and the second step consisting in hydrolysis of the resulting product in an acidic medium to form meta-aryloxybenzaldehyde. the acid used in the second step may be, for example, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid and, consequently, the vessel in which this known process is to be carried out must be resistant to these acids. it has now been found that the process can be carried out in the abse-.ce of such an acid. accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of meta-aryloxybenzaldehydes, which comprises in a first step reacting a mixture of the corresponding meta & loxybenzyl halides and meta-aryloxybenzal halides with hexamethylenetetramine, and, in a second step, hydrolysing the resulting product in the presence of a non-acidic solvent for the said product. as the process according to the invention does not require acidic media, the vessel in which the process is carried out need not be acid-resistant. moreover, the second step can be carried out in a shorter time to obtain an even slightly higher yield of meta-aryloxybenzaldehyde. excellent yields of aldehyde are usually obtained when the non-acidic solvent in the second step of the process according to the invention is a mixture of water and an alkanol with up to four carbon atoms per molecule, particularly ethanol. examples of other suitable alkanols are methanol, propanol, 2-propanol, butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methylpropanol. the product of the first step of the process according to the invention is a mixture comprising a quaternary meta-aryl oxybenzylammonium salt and substantially unconverted meta-aryloxybenzal halide; both these compounds may be isolated and then subjected to the hydrolysis in the second step of the process according to the invention but this is unnecessary because hydrolysis of the reaction mixture from the first step proceeds smoothly and efficiently when carried out in the presence of a non-acidic solvent for the product formed in the first step; good dissolution of the meta-aryloxybenzal halide and the quaternary anmionium salt can be attained by using an alkanoli water mixture containing ho%v to 80at, and preferably 60%v to 70zv, of an alkanol with up to four carbon atoms per molecule. instead of hexamethylenetetramine, ammonia and formaldehyde may be employed in the first step of the process according to the invention and it will be clear that the results will be similar because of the chemical equilibrium between hexamethylenetetramine and ammonia and formaldehyde. thus, ammonia
