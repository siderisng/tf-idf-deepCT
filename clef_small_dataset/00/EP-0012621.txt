<DESCRIPTION>
analces potentis: this invention is directed to improved methods and compositions for producing analgesia. background of the invention one of the long-existing primary goals of medicine is the relief of pain. relief is sought most generally by the administration of analgesic drugs which produce a state of decreased awareness of the sensation and increase of the pain threshold. almost all potent analgesics evoke reactions other than the relief of pain. some of the reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea, constipation and vomiting. among the more serious of the side reactions and one frequently found in analgesic drugs is respiratory depression. thus, in the use of analgesics in man, considerations other than the primary effect (analgesia), must be made and drugs for pain relief are sought which have maximum analgesic effect accompanied by minimum side reactions. it is difficult to satisfy these requirements with a single chemical entity since generally a potent analgesic has accompanying serious side reactions while a drug with little or no side effects are generally less effective as an analgesic. thus, there is a continuing search for a combination of two or more drugs whereby the total quantity of drug can be reduced and which can be employed in such proportions as to produce maximum analgesic effect with little or no side effects. when one or both of the components of a cozbination is known to possess pain relieving properties, but these pro perties are increased many-fold, the net effect of the combination is commonly referred to as potentia- tion." acetaminophen (p-acetaminophenol) is recognized as an analgesic agent with useful and safe antinociceptive properties. however, in certain instances, high doses must be employed to effectively reduce pain. the following drugs, designated as a through g, respectively, have analgesic properties: a) 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid is known by the generic name of 11diclofenac" for use as an anti-inflammatory agent; it also has some analgesic properties. it is represented by the formula emi2.1 b) (z)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-{[4-(methylsulfinyl)phenyl] methylene)-lh-indene-3-acetic acid is known by the generic name of "sulindac" for use as an anti inflammatory agent; it also has analgesic proper ties. it is represented by the formula emi3.1 c) 3-(4-biphenylylcarbonyl)-propionic acid is known by the generic name of "fenbufen" for use as an anti-inflammatory agent; it also has some analgesic properties. it is represented by the formula emi3.2 d) 6-methoxy-a-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid is known by the generic name of "naproxen" for use as anti-inflammatory, analgesic or anti pyretic agent. it is represented by the formula emi4.1 e) m-benzoylhydratropic acid is known by the generic name of "ketoprofen" for use as an anti-inflammatory agent; it also has some analgesic properties. it is represented by the formula emi4.2 f) 4-(1,3-dihydro-1-oxo-2h-isoindol-2-yl)-&alpha;- methylbenzeneacetic acid is known by the generic name of "indoprofen" for use as an anti inflammatory and as an analgesic agent. it is represented by the formula emi5.1 g) a-methyl-3-phenoxybenzeneacetic acid is known by the generic name of "fenoprofen" for use as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent. it is represented by the formula emi5.2 howewer, the effect of
