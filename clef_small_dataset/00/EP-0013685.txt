<ABSTRACT>
1.  a circuit arrangement for the recording, reproduction and processing of radio remote control signals for controlling land vehicles, aircraft or water craft over a plurality of control channels wherein a respective transmitter potentiometer (10, 10a, 10b etc. ) is associated with each of the individual control channels and the individual signals from the outputs from the transmitter potentiometers (10, 10a, 10b etc. ) can be read into a shift register in parallel and can be removed therefrom in series and can be fed to a pulse generator (12) comprising a timing element, in which the amplitude signals received by the shift register are converted into pulse width modulated (pwm) signals for radio remote control, which can then be fed to the hf output (15) of the remote control radio transmitter (14) through a modulator (13), characterized in that, the pwm signals can be fed simultaneously to a recording apparatus (16), that the output from the recording apparatus (16) is connected to the series input (201) to a series parallel decoder (20), the parallel outputs (202, 202a, 202b etc. ) from which are connected to the parallel inputs (111, 111a, 111b etc. ) to the shift register (11) operating as an encoder, through digital-analogue converters (21, 21a, 21b etc. ) and integrator (22, 22a, 22b, etc) connected thereto and coupling resistors (23, 23a, 23b, etc. ) that a voltage divider (24, 25) is connected in parallel with each (e. g.  10) transmitter potentiometer and a further potentiometer (26) is connected between the tapping of the transmitter potentiometer (10) and the tapping of the voltage divider (24, 25), wherein the tapping of the further potentiometer (26) is connected through a resistor (27) to the associated parallel input (111) to the shift register (11).
