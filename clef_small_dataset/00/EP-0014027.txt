<ABSTRACT>
in a secam-pal transcoder, color-difference signals,  sequentially recovered from received secam signals by a  single fm discriminator (15), are supplied via a first emit­ ter-follower (30) to a first modulating signal input terminal  (m) of a balanced modulator (35), which develops a quasi-­ pal signal output using pal subcarrier frequency oscilla­ tions applied in push-pull at carrier terminals (c, c) there­ of.  a dc potential, supplied to a second modulating signal  input terminal (m′) of the modulator via a second emitter-­ follower (70), matches discriminator output level under no-­ color signal conditions.  third and fourth emitter-followers  (90, 100), responsive to a blanking waveform (bl), effects  cutoff of the first and second emitter-followers (30, 70) dur­ ing blanking periods and delivers an elevated planking ped­ estal to the first terminal (m) and a matching blanking ped­ estal to the second terminal (m′).  during a portion of the  blanking period, a burst gating pulse (bg) supplied via the  third emitter-follower (90) causes departure from the blank­ ing pedestal level at the first terminal (m) without disturb­ ing the blanking pedestal level at the second terminal (m′)  to develop a burst component of controlled magnitude in  the quasi-pal signal output from the modulator (35).
