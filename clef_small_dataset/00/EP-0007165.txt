<ABSTRACT>
an air flow control valve, for example for control of air of a  ventilating flow in a ventilation system comprises an axially  extending valve casing (10) having a venturi-shaped inner  face (33), and an axially movable valve member (16) movable  within said valve casing (10) to vary the air flow through the  valve.  in order that the control movement of the valve  member (16) may vary the volume of air flow through the  valve according to the same predetermined function regard­ less of the pressure drop across the valve, or the system in  which it is incorporated, the valve casing (10) is shaped to  compensate for the variation of the drag coefficient of the  valve resulting from movement of the valve member (16).  the  invention also comprises a method for determining the  required dimensions of a valve casing (10) incorporating such  correction.
