<ABSTRACT>
a support suitable for supporting chromium to produce a catalyst capable of giving high melt flow olefin polymers for such applications as injection molding and the like requiring a narrow molecular weight distribution, is produced by treating the support at an elevated temperature with either (1) co, (2) a bromine component, or (3) an oxygen-containing sulfur component.  thereafter, anhydrous chromium can be added, for instance, by means of a hydrocarbon solution of a soluble chromium compound, and the resulting composition activated in air to produce a catalyst.  the bromine treated silica is also suitable for use as a reinforcing agent in rubber or plastics and as a support for a chromatographic column.
