<ABSTRACT>
separation of multicomponent gas mixtures containing a  primary key component, a secondary key component that is  more strongly sorbed and a minor quantity of one or more  tertiary components which are less strongly sorbed than the  secondary key component but more strongly sorbed than the  primary key component.  the mixtures are subject to selective  adsorption in an adiabatic pressure swing cyclic system for  the separate recovery of high purity primary and secondary  key component.  the system comprises different steps applic­ able to the various adsorption trains, each containing a vessel  a and a vessel b.  the different steps are:   (1) adsorption (vessels a and b).    (2) high pressure rinse (vessel a); two pressure equalization  steps and desorption (vessel b).    (3) desorption (vessel a), low pressure purge and pressur­ ization (vessel b).    (4) desorption (vessel a), adsorption (vessel b).    (5) evacuation (vessel a), two pressure equalization steps  and desorption (vessel b).    (6) pressure equalization (vessel a), low pressure purge  (vessel b).    (7) pressurization (vessels a and b).  an example is the treatment of a shift converter effluent  gas from a hydrocarbon reformer plant, wherein hydrogen  (primary key component) and carbon dioxide (secondary key  component) are separately recovered substantially freed of  minor components such as methane, carbon monoxide and  nitrogen (tertiary components).
