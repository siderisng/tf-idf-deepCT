<ABSTRACT>
an immobilized system comprising glucose isomerase  immobilized on a porous phenolic resin having a total surface  area of about 40 to about 200 square meters per gram in the  range of pores above about 30a° of which at least 30% of the  pores have a radius of about 30 to about 250a° and a water  swelling capacity of at least 10% by volume and wherein said  system has a binding efficiency of at least 90% when an  enzyme load of 500 u/ml carrier is offered or at least 80%  when an enzyme load of 1000 u/ml carrier is offered, and an  enzyme half-life during isomerization of at least 10 days.  glu­ cose is converted into levulose using this system.

<DESCRIPTION>
an iwobilized glucose isomerase system and a process r the isomerization of glucose using said system this invention relates to an immobilized glucose isomerase system and to a method of iso.eriz-ng glucose. glucose isomerase is the general name for the enzyme class which converts glucose (dextrose) into levulose (fructose). since glucose isomerase was dis- covered as a product of microorganisms, the industrial production of levulose-bearing syrup from glucose on an industrial scale has become a major commercial process. while levulose-bearing syrup-can be prepared in a batch system using cells containing glucose isomerase, immobilized enzymes are preferred because they facilitate continuous as opposed to batch processing. thus, methods of immobilizing glucose isomerase on various supports have been proposed and described in the prior art. for example, immobilization of glucose isomerase on certain inorganic carriers is described in d.s. patent nos. 3,556,945 and 3,992,329. the use of cellulose derivatives.and synthetic resins as supports for glucose isomerase has also been described in the literature. thus, u.s. patent no. 3,909,354 describes the conversion of glucose to levulose using glucose isomerase bound to either an anion exchange cellulose or a synthetic anion exchange resin. u.s. patent no. 4,078,970 discloses glucose isomerase adsorbed and bound on an anion exchange resin having a porosity of more than 4.58 measured according to an aqueous dextrose solution method and an ion exchange capacity of more than 0.035 meq/ml resin measured according to a polyanion salt decomposition method. the resins are prepared by suspension polymerization of styrene, divinyl benzene, po7ystyrene and toluene in water using benzoyl peroxide as a catalyst, followed by chloromethylation and introduction of anion exchange groups. japanese specification no. s80160/74 desdribes the immobilization of glucose isomerase on specific polyphenol resins, while japanese patent specification no. s48-56770 describes the use of triazine derivatives to bind enzymes to polystyrene, polyphenol, alkylene, polyamine and aliphatic amine ion exchange resins. in belgian patent no. 862,765, a macroporous enzyme support having no ionic characteristics is described. while many of the previously described supports for glucose isomerase do function two produce levulosebearing syrups, they possess certain disadvantages. for 'example, some carriers result in poor enzyme activity, while other carriers require low throughput. furthermore, many -of these carriers are expensive and some must be regenerated and reused several times, adding to manufacturing costs. notwithstanding the plethora of enzyme supports known in the prior art, it has been discovered that a phenolic resin having a specific porosity profile and water swelling capacity has surprising and unexpected properties when used as a support for a specific glucose isomerase. more in detail, this invention is directed to an immobilized glucose isomerase system that includes a glucose isomerase derived from streptomyces olivochromogenes atcc nos. 21,114; 21,713; 21,714 or 21,715. deposited strains atcc nos. 21,713; 21,714 and 21,715 are mutant strains of streptomyces olivochromogenes atcc no. 21,114. the glucose isomerase can also be derived from mutant strains of the atcc. no. 21,715 microorganism. a commercially available glucose isomerase that is derived from the atcc no. 21,715 microorganism or mutant
