<ABSTRACT>
a method of recovering tungsten values from a high  grade tungsten bearing ore or concentrate such as scheelite  or wolframite includes the steps of roasting, without fusion,  the ore or concentrate in the presence of a reactive composi­ tion selected from the group of an alkali metal chloride, an  alkali metal carbonate and mixtures thereof and extracting  the water-soluble tungsten values from the roasted product,  e. g.  by water leaching.  the reactive composition is prefer­ ably an alkali metal carbonate on its own.

<DESCRIPTION>
this irvention relates to the recovery of tungsten values from tungsten bearing nres or concentrates. tungsten is generally found in nature in scheelite type ores and wolframite type ores. these two ores differ substantially in their chemical composition being a calcium tungstate and an iron-manganese tungstate, respectively. consequently, different processes have generally bee used to recover the tungsten values from, each type of ore. in the case of- scheelite ores, the classical prior art process is to treat the ore with hydrochloric acid to produce insoluble tungstic acid. the tungstic acid is taken up in an ammonia solution to produce ultimately ammonium paratungstate (apt). wolframite on the other hand is usually decomposed by fusing thwe ore with sodium hydroxide/sodium carbonate which extracts the tungsten as sodi;;m tungstate. the cooled fused product is leached--with water¯to extract the soluble sodium tungstate. similarly, this may be treated with hydrochloric acid to precipitate tungstic acid which is taken up in an ammonia solution to produce apt. british patent specification no. 1,089,913 describes 2 process for recovering tungsten values from both scheelite and wolframite type ores or concentrates. this process comprises fusing powdered scheelite and/or wolframite tupe ores or concentrates with a fluxing mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium chloride and sodium nitrate (which mixture also contains, in the case of the starting material containing calcium, at least sufficient siliceous material te form calcium silicate thtiewith), reaching the colcd, fused material with iste#; ;and separating a tungsten-bearing alkaline leach liquor from water-insoluble impurities, acs.dfy1.ng the separated leach liquor and adding thereto sufficient of the fluoride or hydrofluoric acid to form, with any silicon and phosphorus present, compounds which are substantially insoluble in organic media extracting the thus-treated material with an organic solution comprising an crganic amine capable of forming a waterinsoluble organic amine tungsten complex to transfer tungsten from the aqueous to the organic phase, separating the phases, treating the separated organic phase, with aqueous ammonia to form a water-soluble ammonium tungstate, and separating the aqueous phase containing ammonium tungstate from the organic phase. this process involves, as an essential step, the fusion of powdered scheelite and/or wolframite type ores or concentrates with a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride. indeed, it is stated in the specification that a fluid melt should be produced. typical temperatures at which the fusion take place are 698"c to 825 c. fox u.s. patent specification no. 3,800,025 describes a process of extracting tungsten values from low grade tungsten ores which includes the steps of roasting a particulated tungsten-containing ore in a water containing atmosphere in the presence of sodium chloride and at least one of the reagents selected from sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate at a temperature in the range of about 6000c to about 900 c for about 1 to 3 hours, water leaching the resulting calcines to dissolve soluble tungsten values and filtering. this process is restricted in application to low grade tungsten ores and requires a water containing atmosphere for its operation. moreover, rel;itively high roast
