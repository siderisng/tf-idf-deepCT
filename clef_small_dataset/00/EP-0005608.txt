<ABSTRACT>
a connector for terminating flat ribbon cable composed  of flexible electrical insulation and retaining a plurality of  electrically isolated, parallel conductors.  the connector  includes a housing (12) that defines a slot (15) for receiving  an end of a flat ribbon cable (16) to be terminated and  comprises a base (13) that defines a row of contact  receptacles (18) extending transversely to the slot and  aligned with individual conductors in the cable.  also comprising  the housing is a cover (14) adapted for mating  engagement with the base and defining catch wall portions  (52) extending transversely to the cable slot.  retained by  each of the receptacles is a contact (23) having a head  portion (31) having cutting edges (34, 35) shaped and  arranged to receive and penetrate the insulation surrounding  a different conductor in the cable and to make electrical  contact therewith.  the contacts also include latch portions  (32) for engaging and fastening the cover of the housing to  the base.  included in each latching portion is a tab (41)  extending substantially longitudinally of the slot and parallel  to the cable conductors and arranged to engage the catch  wall portion of the cover.  also, the latching and catch wall  portions are shaped and arranged such that the forces  produced in response to engagement therebetween are  oriented so as to have substantially no tendency to cause  relative movement between the cutting edges.
