<DESCRIPTION>
"stair mat" this invention relates to a stair mat adapted to be installed on stairs, especially stairs arranged to the inside of the building. in general, stair nosings are installed on the edge of stops for the purpose of preventing a person frou missing his footing on the stairs and of obviating tile danger of lie missed footing, and carpeting is applied to the stairs for the purpose of giving an ornamentalitys further of giving a sound absorption, a buffer action, 2 thermal insulation and a flexibility, conventionally the carpeting is fixed by stair rods. however, with stair nosings, the sound absorp tion, the thermal insulation and the flexibility are lacking on the steps and the buffer action is insuffici- ent, and with continuous stair carpets, the carpets are worn away at the edge of the steps. such carpets should be changed when dirty, which is uneconomical. there is a tendency to connect the stair nosing and the narrow carpet in one united body, or to combine stair nosing and the narrow carpet separately installed on the steps. however, the former must be uneconomically changed when the stair nosing or the carpet is horn away or damaged and changing work is difficult, the latter is not fixed firmly and its installing work is difficult; furthermore it brings into existence undesirable dispersion, for it may be installed in a manncr that the stair nosing and the carpet are put side by side or one above the other by driving in of nails or screwing. one object of the present invention is to provide a stair mat which can alleviate the problem of missed footing or the stairs d to obviate the danger of missed footing by covering the edge of the stair, and which gives effects of nonskid and cushioning, and further gives sound absorption, thermal insulation, flexibility and ornamentality. another object of the present invention is to provide a stair mat which can be easily installed on each of the steps, and being free of undesirable dispersion. according to the invention there is provided a stair mat comprising: a tread base sheet member adapted to be fixed on a tread having at its front edge an edge covering bead adapted to cover the forward edge of the stairs; and a tread mat adapted to be fixed on the tread base sheet member so as to be adjacent to the edge covering bead. the tread mat can be easily and firmly fixed on each step, is free of undesirable dispersion, and can be easily changed according to the extent to which it is worn out, damaged, dirty, and the detached tread mat can be washed. the stair mat protects the forward edge of the step, and gives effects of non-skid and cushioning, further gives sound absorption, thermal insulation, flexibility and ornamentality. the stair mat can alleviate the problem of missed footing on the stairs and obviate the danger of missed footing. the stair mat is economical and su able for the
