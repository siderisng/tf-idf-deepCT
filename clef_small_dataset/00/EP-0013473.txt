<ABSTRACT>
a tubular explosives cartridge (12) having at least one  end closed by a transverse closure disc (11) of resilient  closed-cell foamed synthetics plastics material, for example,  foamed polyethylene, the disc having an uncompressed  diameter greater than the internal diameter of the tubular  cartridge case.  the closure provides a waterproof seal with­ out preventing communication of detonation between car­ tridges and may be readily pierced for the insertion of a deto­ nator.  when the closure consists of nitrogen blown  polyethylene, it does not increase the risk of firedamp ignition  in coal mines.
