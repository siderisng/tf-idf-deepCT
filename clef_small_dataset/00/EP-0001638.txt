<ABSTRACT>
railway systems (3, 4) having crossing rails (18, 19) for rail- supported pallets (7) must make it possible for the pallets to be able to be transferred to the rails running parallel or at an angle.  for these transfer stations it is required that the swivelling of the pallet can take place on rails arranged at any desired angle, that these require little space and that the pallets can be of any loadability.  in order to make this possible with the simplest means and inexpensively, the pallets have wheels (12) which are arranged in the pallet so as to be pivotable about a perpendicular axis (24).  in the crossing points of the rails (7 to 10), rotatable rail pieces (31) are arranged about a perpendicular axis (33), each of which pieces receive one wheel of the pallet.  the rail pieces with the corresponding wheels of the pallet are rotated into the new conveying direction.  <image>
