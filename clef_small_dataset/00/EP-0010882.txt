<ABSTRACT>
a switching circuit (1) has a solid state power switch  (9) which is either a pnp or npn transistor or a vmos p-足 or n-channel device.  three individual sensing circuits (2,  3, 4) are set to indicate whether a predetermined operating  characteristic of the switch (9) is greater or less than a  given threshold value and thus to indicate if a fault is pre足 sent in the switch (9) or the load (l) it supplies.  digital  logic circuit means comprising three logic circuits (5, 6, 8)  produce two digital signals (d, p) from the output signals  of the sensing circuits respectively indicating if a fault exists  and if it is a serious fault or not.  a circuit (7) comprising  gating means disables the switch (9) in the event of a  serious fault and a delay circuit (33, 34) is provided as足 sociated with the logic circuit means to prevent current  surges due to short circuit faults being confused with nor足 mal operating current surges in switch on.
