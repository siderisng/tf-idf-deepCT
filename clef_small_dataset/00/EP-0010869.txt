<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus are provided for forming a  zero tail length splice between a new roll (26) of web  material and an expiring roll (24) without interrupting  continuous movement of the web (w).  firstly, a splicing  strip is adhesively secured to the leading edge of the new  roll (26) and is releasably secured to the surface of the  new roll so that it can be rotated without unwinding until  it is spliced, and a marker (80) is placed on the new roll  at a predetermined distance ahead of the leading edge.   thereafter, the new roll (26) is swung by the indexing head  (28) into close proximity with the moving web (w) and  the movement of the indexing head is stopped when the  new roll is positioned just above the surface of the moving  web the new roll is then rotated so that its surface speed  matches the speed of the moving web, whereupon the  moving web is forced into engagement with the rotating  new roll at the point of closest proximity therebetween,  after the leading edge on the new roll has passed this point;  as determined by the sensing device (162) detecting the  marker (80) for a first time.  finally, cutting means (102)  is actuated upon the second detection of the marker (80)  and the splicing strip adhesively engages the moving web  (w) adjacent the tail end thereof to form the splice.
