<ABSTRACT>
a catalyst composition comprising a solution of an  organometallic complex of platinum or rhodium in a liquid  allyl ether which has a b. p.  of at least 150° c at 1 bar and  which is free from groups having an adverse effect on the  catalytic affect of the complex; polyorganosiloxane coat­ ing compositions containing a si-h polysiloxane and a  polysiloxane containing si-oh, si-vinyl or si-allyl groups,  an organometaliic complex of platinum or rhodium and an  allyl ether as defined above; and the use of the composi­ tions for preparing release coatings on substrates.  in the coating of substrates, especially paper, with  release coatings based on heat-curable polysiloxane com­ positions, organo-metallic complexes of platinum or rho­ dium can be used as catalysts provided they are dissolved  in the composition.  the low-boiling solvents hitherto used  have disadvantages in causing atmospheric pollution and  requiring solvent-recovery plant.  the ethers defined can  be uses in place of the low-boiling solvents to give satis­ factory coatings without the mentioned disadvantages.
