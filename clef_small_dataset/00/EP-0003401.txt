<ABSTRACT>
a cutter assembly and a cutting machine including such  a cutter assembly for successively removing pieces from a  workpiece (12) in which two cutter members (28, 30) within a  housing (21) are movable relative to each other to perform  a cutting action, and an opening (32) is provided in the  housing (21) through which the workpiece (12) can be  inserted in use to be cut by the cutter members (28, 30).  the machine is arranged to move relative to the  workpiece (12), and means, such as a vacuum system, is  provided to remove swarf from the workpiece (12) so that  contamination of the workpiece (12) can be avoided.  wear of  the cutting edge (29) is evened out by using a circular cutter  (28) which is indexed round before each cut.  preferably the cutting machine and its cutter assembly  are arranged to operate remotely without the need for  manual intervention, and are particularly suitable for cutting  through an elongate lip weld between two sheets of metal.
