<ABSTRACT>
ethanol is produced by reacting methanol with hydrogen  and carbon monoxide at elevated temperature and  pressure in the presence of a catalyst comprising cobalt, an  iodide or a bromide and a compound having the formula  x(a)(b)(c) in which formula x is nitrogen or phosphorus and  a, b and c are individually monovalent organic radicals, or x  is phosphorus and any two of a, b and c together form an  organic divalent cyclic ring system bonded to the x atom, or  x is nitrogen and all of a, b and c form an organic trivalent  cyclic ring system bonded to the x atom, and in the  additional presence of an added inert liquid which is  characterised as a compound capable of forming, under  normal conditions of temperature and pressure, a separate  phase in the presence of methanol containing up to 20% w/w  water, which compound contains in its structure bonds other  than carbon/carbon and carbon/hydrogen.  typical of the  inert liquids which may be employed are chlorobenzene,  decanoic acid, polydimethylsiloxane fluid and methyl phenyl  silicone fluid.  the addition of the inert liquid suppresses  side-reactions and thereby increases the total yield and  selectivity to ethanol.
