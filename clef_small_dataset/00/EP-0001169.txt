<ABSTRACT>
a harness device for attaching a towing line (17) to a  surfboard (20) has an automatic release mechanism which  operates to disconnect the surfboard from the line if the surfboards  should turn over or become inclined to the length of the  line by more than a predetermined threshold angle.  the  automatic release mechanism includes an enlarged head (18),  for example, spherical or cylindrical, which is lodged into a  coupling socket (14) in the underside of the board, the socket  having a narrow mouth or lip (15) behind which the head  lodges if the inclination of the line to the general plane of the  surfboard is sufficiently small, while allowing the head to  disengage from the socket if this inclination increases to an  angle beyond the threshold inclination.  handles joined to the  towing line may also be incorporated into the harness.
