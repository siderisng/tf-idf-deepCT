<ABSTRACT>
an integrated circuit read-only memory (rom) with  improved speed of operation is disclosed as generally rep足 resentative of similarly improved logic arrays.  the rom  includes parallel rows of conductors oriented normal to para足 llel doped regions which form column conductors.  the rom  is implemented with field-effect transistors and comprises  two decoder fields and a data field.  the transistors of the  decoder fields serve to define open circuits between adjacent  column conductors in accordance with binary input signals  applied to the decoder fields.  in the illustrative rom, a first  column conductor 646 is connected to a return terminal of a  power supply and a second column conductor 638 is con足 nected to a "pull-up" circuit 614.  the illustrative circuit pro足 vides for the connection of power supply return connections  to both ends of the one column conductor and provides for  the connection of pull-up circuits to both ends of the second  column conductor.  the row conductors are connected to  gates of transistors in both the data and the decoder fields  and a low impedance path from the pull-up circuits to the  power supply return is established in response to signals on  the row conductors.
