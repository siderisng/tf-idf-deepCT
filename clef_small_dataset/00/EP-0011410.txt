<ABSTRACT>
an electronic starter circuit for a discharge lamp is pro­ vided.  the lamp (8) has preheatable electrodes (10, 12), a pair  of terminals of which electrodes are connectable to a pair of  input terminals (2, 4) of an ac voltage source.  the starter  comprises a thyristor switch (16) connected in series to  another pair of terminals of the lamp electrodes and an igni­ tion circuit connected to the thyristor switch.  the thyristor  switch is controllable by the ignition circuit, which ignition  circuit, upon actuation of the starter, repeatedly, for a pre­ determined number of cycles calculated by the characteris­ tics and values of the ignition circuit elements to ensure a  definite ignition of the lamp (8) under standard conditions,  renders the thyristor switch (16) conductive.  the ignition cir­ cuit cuts off the conduction of the thyristor switch upon the  ignition of the lamp (8) or the termination of the predeter­ mined number of cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
electronic starters for discharge lamps the present invention relates to electronic starters for igniting discharge lamps and in particular the invention relates to starters for providing rapid ignition of discharge lamps having preheatable electrodes, the electrodes having a pair of terminals connectable to a pair of input terminals of an ac voltage source. the main disadvantages of the more advanced known electronic starters include: a) the dependence of the starting operation on the voltage of the mains as well as on the lamps built-in parameters which results in the instability of the starting operation and which dependence prevents the provision of a universal starter suitable for a wide range of lamps; b) the radio interferences caused during the starting operation of the lamp due to the repeated interruption of the igniting circuit whenever the lamp is conducting or whenever the conduction is instable which, in turn, also shortens the lamp's lifetime; and c) whenever the the lamp itself is out of order in these types of starters, a starting current will constantly flow which, of course, brings about the waste of costly energy. in contradistinction to the known electronic starters operating on the principle of the voltage level which is applied across the lamp, the starter of the present invention essentially operates on the principle of ignition time, resulting in a safe, flickerless and a more rapid fluorescent-lamp starting system. essentially, the electronic starter of the present invention includes a controlled switch which is constituted by a thyristor and an ignition circuit. the term thyristor used herein is meant to refer to the electronic solid state components, such as, a silicon controlled rectifier (scr), diac, a triac and their equivalents. the actuation of said controlled switch, i.e., the rendering of said thyristor into its conduction state in order to pass current therethrough for igniting the lamp, is repeatedly effected for a predetermined period of time by means of properly chosen values of the components of the igniting circuit. this predetermined period of time is chosen or adjusted to be of a duration which is always at least equal to, and preferably greater than the longest duration required for a positive sure ignition of a lamp under the commonly acceptable conditions for igniting the kind of lamps for which the proposed starter is intended. with the starter according to the present invention, in case when the lamp did not ignite during said predetermined period of time due to a malfunction, the starter circuit ceases to conduct after said period of time as the thyristor is switched back to its nonconductive state. this independence of the ignition time of the proposed starter from the actual starting process, as opposed to the case in many other known prior art electronic starters, the operation of which is based on the change of the voltage level applied to the lamp during the ignition period, facilitates the provision of a novel universal starter suitable for igniting a wide range of discharge lamps of various operating potentials
