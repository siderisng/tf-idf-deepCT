<ABSTRACT>
1.  a blank for realizing a packing, formed from a sheet material, which has a main direction and is divided in several zones by fold lines extending transversely to said main direction, the opposite end zones of the blank comprising complementary interlocking members which mutually cooperate in engagement for closing the final volume-shaped packing with said end zones coming into overlapping relationship, said interlocking members comprising at least a first tab (3) on a first of said end zones and at least an opening in a second of said end zones, said first tab (3) having an enlarged portion directed towards the direction opposite to said second end zone of said blank in flat configuration and connected to the body of said first end zone by a portion of reduced width (31), the junction between said enlarged portion and said portion of reduced width of said first tab forming at least a shoulder (32, 32') extending substantially perpendicularly to said main direction of said blank, said enlarged portion having its maximum width at the level of said shoulder, said opening (40) having an evolutive width and defining a transversally extending edge (41) on the side of the end edge of said second end zone at a distance therefrom, the width of said transversal edge (41) being lower than the width of the enlarged portion of said tab at the level of said shoulder (32, 32'), characterized in this that said opening (40) has lateral sides or edges (42) diverging from said transversal edge (41) up to a first imaginary line (43) at a first distance from said edge (42) in the direction opposite to said end edge of said second end zone and which then converge towards a second imaginary line (45) at a second distance from said edge greater than said first distance, the width of said opening (40) at the level of the said first imaginary line (43) being greater than the maximum width of said tab (43), in that it comprises on said second end zone a second tab (50) having evolutive lateral edges and a transversally extending end edge (51), said second tab (5) extending over a portion of the surface of said opening (40) and being connected to the body of said second end zone at the level of said second imaginary line (45), and in that said first tab (3) is formed by a single cutting line defining the contour of said first tab (3) in a portion of said first end zone remote from the end edge thereof.
