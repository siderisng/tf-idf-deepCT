<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a novel method of synthesizing certain  3-(2′,5′-dialkoxy-4′-substituted phenyl) phthalides wherein  the 4-substituent has para-directing properties.  these com­ pounds provide a novel and regiospecific synthesis of a  9-acetyl-6, 11-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-7,8,9,10-­ tetrahydronaphthacene-5, 12-quinone (7,9-­ dideoxydaunomycinone) in particular, which is a known  intermediate in the synthesis of daunomycinone.  there is also  provided a method of preparing analogs of 7,9-­ dideoxydaunomycinone.  daunomycinone is a known com­ pound which is an intermediate in the preparation of the  clinically accepted naturally-occurring antitumor antibiotics  daunomycin and its derivative adriamycin.
