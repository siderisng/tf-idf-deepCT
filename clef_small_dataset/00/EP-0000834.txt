<ABSTRACT>
a drying oil, for example isomerized linseed oil or dehydrated  castor oil, which has an iodine value of 140 or more and  a content of conjugated double bonds of less than 50% is  reacted with isopropenylphenol and/or at least one oligomer  thereof in an amount, by weight, generally of 0. 1 - 2 times as  great as that of the drying oil in the presence of a small  amount of an acid preferably at a temperature of 65 - 150Â°c for  0. 5 - 3 hours to modify the oil.  by the modifying reaction,  isopropenylphenol and/or its oligomer(s) is/are introduced  into the drying oil while leaving the double bonds of the oil as  they are.  the thus modified oil is further reacted with a phenol  or phenols under strongly acidic conditions to introduce  therein one or more phenols to further modify the oil.  the  further modified drying oil serving as a phenolic component  or a part thereof is then reacted with formladehyde or a compound  based on formaldehyde to give a modified phenolic  resin.  this modified phenolic resin is useful for making a  phenolic laminate with improved flexibility, punching quality  and waterproofness.
