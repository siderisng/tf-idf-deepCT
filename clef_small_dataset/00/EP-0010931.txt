<ABSTRACT>
a process of forming polyurethane compositions  which emit reduced amounts of toxic smoke on burning is  described.  the process comprises reacting a mixture of an  organic compound having two or more active hydrogen  atoms, an organic polyfunctional isocyanate, a catalyst and  at least one metal salt of an aliphatic or alicyclic monoÂ­ carboxylic acid wherein the metal is cobalt, copper, nickel  or manganese.  the metal salt is added to the mixture in an  amount which is sufficient to reduce the formation of toxic  substances when the polyurethane is ignited.
