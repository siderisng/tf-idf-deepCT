<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and the operating device which makes it possible to synthesize and make directly, epoitaxially, of aluminum nitride (Ain) on an aluminum oxide substrate (Al₂O₃ or sapphire) to a High temperature and possibly incorporating impurities determining a given conductivity type and according to appropriate concentrations, so as to obtain aluminum nitride that can be used for electronic purposes and having properties such that it can be used in semi devices. -Conductors (including ultravioletular radiation emitters). practically a layer (11) of Ain on a substrate (7) in Al₂O₃ in a reaction chamber which comprises a carbon source (3), elements (4) of Al₂O₃ (or Ain), a source Doping material (12), for example mg Al₂O₄, arranged in a cavity of the heating element (1) in tungsten. A training gas (10) (85% N₂ and 15% H₂) is introduced into the chamber whose temperature is close to 2000 ° C. It is important that the gas is subjected to the chamber to a convection movement.
