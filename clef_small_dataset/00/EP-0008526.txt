<ABSTRACT>
to effect an efficient seal between two relatively movable  members of a microwave appliance e. g.  the door and door  frame of a microwave oven, a sealing strip (20) is made in a  finely tapering shape and from an electrically conductive elas­ tomeric material such as a highly loaded silicone-based rub­ ber.  the taper is to point towards the interior of the appliance  being sealed so as to present a surface (38) at a low, angle of  incidence to radiation (50), while the whole of the surface (34)  of the sealing strip which is at a low taper angle to the surface  38 is in thermal contact with the device e. g.  the door frame  (32).  the angle between the surfaces (34 and 38) is of the order  of 8 1 / 2°.  to allow effective sealing of and thermal contact with  the other movable part e. g.  the door (30), the thicker end of the  strip should be compressed by approximately 1/3 of its  relaxed thickness and for this purpose it may be made of  greater compliance than the remainder of the strip by the  presence of a hole (28).
