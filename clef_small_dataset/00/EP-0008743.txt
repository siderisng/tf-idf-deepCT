<ABSTRACT>
method, track structure and sleeper for improving the  vibration absorbtion of a railway track supported on a bed of  ballast, more especially a ballast bed lying in a tunnel, on a  fly-over or another artificial construction, said track consisting  of rails (2,3) supported by sleepers (5) extending in lateral  direction, wherein the track is lifted some centimeters that  around the edge of the supporting surface of the sleepers (5)  the ballast lying above the level of said surface is removed,  that a plate (8) of a vibration energy absorbing material is  shifted between the supporting surface of the ballast bed (1)  and the sleepers (5) and that thereafter the track is lowered  again and as far as is required the ballast around the sleepers  is brought in the original position or there is supplied new  ballast.
