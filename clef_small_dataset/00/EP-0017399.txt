<ABSTRACT>
in a window lining the corner between two adjoining  planer lining members (1 and 2) is tightened by a wedge  effect provided by engagement between a displaceable rail  (12) on the first member (1) and a rail (9) fixed on the second  member (2).  after the mounting of said second member the  first members can be brought into its place adjacent the fixed  rail (9) and can be tightened by hammer blows which may be  transmitted to the end of the displaceable rail (12) via a thin  punch so that the gap between the lining and the wall  surrounding the window opening may be correspondingly  narrow.
