<ABSTRACT>
a plurality of paving stones (2) consisting of concrete or the like are connected in a ready-to-lay arrangement to a paving unit (1) and, after laying, can be separated again into individual stones.  the individual stones are connected closely together by bonding together of the fresh stones as long as their material has not fully set, and/or by sticking together using an adhesive.  according to the method, the stones (2) are connected to a paving unit (1) by being pressed together by the forces acting in the plane of the stones (2) after the compression moulding and demoulding, the connection being produced at the points against which the stones make contact.  <image>
