<ABSTRACT>
a method of depositing ink compositions by ink jet printing on metal, plastic, or paper surfaces to develop a tacky imprint surface and thereafter applying at least one magnetic pigment to give the printed pattern properties of opacity and a magnetic character readability.

<DESCRIPTION>
magnetic jet ink printing this invention relates to jet ink recordings characterized by opaque properties in light. more specifically, this invention relates to ink recordings which are opaque in ordinary light and magnetically readable so as to render them particularly suitable as a means for marking various materials. ink jet printing is a recent development in the art of applying identifying and decorative indicia to a base. in general terms, a fluid ink is forced, under pressure, through a very small orifice in an orifice block which contains a piezoelectric crystal vibrating at high frequency (50 - 100,000 vibrations per second) causing the ink passing through the orifice to be broken into minute droplets equal in number to the crystal vibrations. the minute droplets are passed through a charging area where individual droplets receive an electrical charge in response to a video signal, the magnitude of the charge being dependent on the amplitude of the video signal. the droplets then pass through an electrical field of fixed intensity, causing a varied deflection of the individual droplets depending on the.density of the charge associated therewith, after which the deflected drops are directed to the base medium which is to receive the decorative or informative printed indicia. in order to operate satisfactorily in an ink jet printing system, an ink must display a consistent drop breakup length, drop velocity and drop charge under set operating conditions. it has been determined that inks with viscosities of 25 cps. will perform satisfactorily depending upon the type of nozzle used. however, inks with lower viscosities perform much better. resistivity of ink may range as high as 10,000 ohm-cm. for satisfactory operations. the information recording process of the present invention includes jet printing by producing a fine jet of liquid droplets, directing the jet toward the recording medium and modulating the density of the jet with an electric field in accordance with information to be recorded. the information is recorded on the medium since the liquid or ink contacts the medium in a pattern determined by the modulation and adheres to the medium upon impact. the liquid may be colorless at this point, as it is subsequently contacted by a magnetic pigment to produce a magnetic image and to make the information opaque and visible. the magnetic pigment is applied to the medium before the ink is dried so that it adheres to the ink, and is preferably applied while the ink is in a tacky state. one method of applying the particles is to pass the medium over a magnetic surface, and thus draw the pigment to the medium by magnetic means. another means of applying the pigment may be to pass the medium through a fluidized bed of magnetic pigment, the important consideration being the contacting of the medium by the magnetic figment while the liquid is still sufficiently tacky to adhere the appropriate amount of pigment. this would be determined by such factors as the temperature of the operation, the solvent content in

 what is claimed is:    1. a process for information recording comprising producing a fine jet of liquid, modulating the charge density of the jet by applying an electric field in accordance with the information to be recorded, directing the jet of liquid to a recording medium to record said information, and subsequently applying at least one magnetic pigment to said recorded information on said medium, thereby rendering said recorded information magnetic, opaque and visible.    2. the process of claim 1 wherein comminuted iron oxide is used as the magnetic pigment to render the recording magnetic, opaque and visible.    3. the process of clam 2 wherein the information pattern is allowed to dry to a tacky state before adherence of the magnetic pigment.    4. the process of claim 3 wherein the magnetic pigment is applied to the tacky pattern by means of magnetic attraction.    5. the process of claim 1 wherein the jet ink has a viscosity of from 1.5 to 25 cps at 250c and a resistivity of up to 10,000 ohm-cm.      6.    the process of claim 5 wherein the viscosity is from 1.8 to 7.5 cps and the resistivity is from 1,500 to 4,000 ohm-cm.    7. a process for information recording comprising     producing,    a   fizzle    jet of a liquid   ccntalning    a mixture of a   resit    dissolved in a solvent containing an aliphatic monovalent   alct    of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, modulating the charge density of the jet by applying an electrical field in accordance with information to be recorded, directing the jet of liquid to a recording medium to record the information, subsequently allowing the recorded information to dry to a tacky state, and thereafter applying a magnetic pigment to the recorded information on the medium.     8. the process of claim 7 wherein the jet of liquid is colorless, and is rendered opaque and visible by the application of the magnetic pigment.    9. the process of claim 8 wherein the magnetic   pigment    is applied by contacting the surface of the medium with comminuted magnetic particles.    10. the process of claim 9   wherein    the   comminute &    magnetic particles are comminuted iron oxide.
