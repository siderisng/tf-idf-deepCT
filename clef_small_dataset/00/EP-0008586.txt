<ABSTRACT>
a method and an installation for the manufacture of tubular bodies, in particular sheet-steel scale preventers.  scale preventers are tubes with a thickness of about 1 mm which are placed inside ingot moulds to prevent the formation of scales during the casting of the steel.  conventional scale preventers are manufactured by bending cut sheets and by welding their superposed edges.  the majority of this work is carried out by hand.  in order to simplify, accelerate and automate the manufacture of scale preventers, two sheet strips (1a, 1b) are unwound from coils (2a, 2b), cut off, positioned on either side of a mandrel (m) around which they are bent, the edges of the sheets are superposed and joined by punching.  the installation comprises two unwinders (2a, 2b), two arrangements of driving rollers (3a, 3b) and two shearing tools (4a, 4b), a mandrel (m) perforated at a plurality of locations and on the lateral sides of which are located two movable bending forms (5a, 5b) and two punch-carrying bars (6a, 6b).  the position of the latter corresponds to that of the perforations of the mandrel (m).  the punches (7) perforate and join the coverings of the bent sheets (1a, 1b).  <image>
