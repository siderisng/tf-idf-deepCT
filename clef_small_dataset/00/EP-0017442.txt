<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for collecting fume and/or slag  generated by the operation of an air-carbon arc cutting and  gouging torch.  the apparatus includes a hood (20) which can  hold torch (12) and is provided with a nozzle (24) to convey  fume and/or slag from the hood (20).  air and water is  introduced into the nozzle to cool the fume and/or slag and  inhibit the slag adhereing to the nozzle.  the slag and water  are subsequently separated from the fume which is filtered  and returned to the air.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to an apparatus and a method for collecting fumes and/or slag generated by the operation of an air-cljon arc cutting and gouging torch. in the air-carbon arc cutting and gouging process an electric arc is struck between an electrode and a workpiece to initiate melting of the workpiece under the arc. the molten metal produced by the arc is forcibly removed from the workpiece by a stream of high pressure air. this process generates a large amount of fume because of the thermochemical reactions and produces waste particulate material (herein referred to as "slag"). with the advent of more stringent air pollution control restrictions ways have been sought to inhibit the fume and/or slag being inhaled by the process operative. fume collectors have been known for some time and are widely available for use with conventional welding torches. these devices create a partial vacuum in a sleeve disposed near the nozzle of the torch. the fume generated by the welding is sucked away from the nozzle of the torch through a conduit and is disposed of in a safe manner. insofar as the air-carbon arc cutting and gouging process is concerned our us patent no. 3,524,038 discloses a device for removing slag from the vicinity of the arc. this device has been available for some time as a hand held tool or a machine mounted tool that must be used in close proximity to an air-carbon arc cutting and gouging torch. while this device will remove some process generated fume, it will not prohibit the type of atmosphere movement to comply with current us air pollution requirements. the literature shows that in japan installations employing the air-carbon arc cutting and gouging process have utilized conventional cutting tables with a water bath to collect slag generated by the process. the japanese have further combined the conventional water table with an acoust ically lined hood to contain fume and to control the noise level of the process in the immediate environment of the process operative. this type of apparatus is not readily portable and requires a fixed installation where the workpiece must be transported to the installation to be treated. according to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for collecting fume and/or slag generated by the operation of an air-carbon arc cutting and gouging torch, which apparatus is characterized in that it comprises: (a) a housing which can be positioned in close proximity to a workpiece; (b) means on said housing to hold an air-carbon arc cutting and gouging torch fast with respect to said housing; (c) a nozzle for conveying fume and/or slag from said housing; and (d) means for introducingamixtureofgasandcooling liquid into said nozzle to cool said fume and/or slag and inhibit said slag adhering to said nozzle. preferably, said housing is provided with a seal which, in use, engages said workpiece circumjacent said air-carbon arc cutting and gouging torch. advantageously, said housing and said nozzle are enclosed in a sound absorbent hood and said
