<ABSTRACT>
an installation for casting ceramic sanitaryware articles,  having a plurality of moulds arranged in a horizontal line on  a support structure, in which each mould includes two side  parts (2,3; 40, 45) which when assembled define a casting  cavity for casting a cistern tank for a water closet suite.  in  order to be able to open and close each mould by movement  in a horizontal direction, one of the side parts (2; 40) has a  vertical cavity surface for forming the back wall of the tank  and the other side part (3; 45) is channel shaped in plan for  forming the front and side walls of the tank, and the side  parts are movable longitudinally along the support structure.   one of the side parts has an integral base for forming the  bottom wall of the tank.  the moulds may have cores (4) for  solid casting, or apertures (55) for drain casting.

<DESCRIPTION>
installation for casting ceramic sanitaryware articles this invention relates to an installation for casting from ceramic material in slip form articles of sanitaryware, in which a plurality of mould units are arranged in a generally horizontal line on a support structure. casting in such installations is known as battery or bank casting. it has been proposed to cast certain articles of sanitaryware in a line of moulds which are arranged on a support structure so as to permit movement of the mould parts in a direction longitudinally of the line; for example british patent specification no. 1,140,282 shows such an installation for casting wash hand basins. hitherto it has not been thought possible to cast cistern tanks for water closet suites in an installation of this kind because moulds for casting cistern tanks conventionally involve separation of the mould parts only in a vertical direction. thus, normally, moulds for casting cistern tanks are made of two parts which, relative to the upright position of a cistern tank, comprise a container part which shapes the exterior of the side walls and bottom wall of the cistern tank, and a top part which closes the mould cavity, the two parts being separable at a horizontal parting plane by relative movement in a vertical direction. the cast piece is removed from the container part by movement in a vertical direction unless the mould is turned. the top part may have a core which projects down into the container part, for solid casting of a cistern tank, or the top part may simply be a closure member and the container part may riude temperaturen @@@@@@ @@ casting of a cistern tank. such moulds are unsuitable f use tn a horizozital line of moulds because of the vertical separation of mould parts and the vertical emptying. for the present invention, moulds for casting cistern tanks are adapted for use on a horizontal line by dividing the mould vertically into two side parts. according to the present invention there is provided an installation for casting from ceramic material in sl form articles of sanitaryware, having a plurality of mould units arranged in a generally horizontal line on a support structure, in which each mould unit comprises two side mould parts which can be assembled to define a casting cavity for casting a cistern tank for a water closet suite, one side mould part having a substantially vertical cavity surface for forming the back wall of the cistern tank and the other side part being substantially channel-shaped in plan and having substantially vertical cavity surfaces for forming the side walls and front wall of the cistern tank, one of the side parts having an integral base for forming the bottom wall of the cistern tank, the side mould parts being adapted to be opened and closed by relative movement in a direction longitudinally of the line of mould units, each side mould part being connected in back-to-back relation to the adjacent side mould part of the next

claims   1. an installation for casting from ceramic material in slip form articles of sanitaryware, having a plurality of mould units arranged in a generally horizontal line on a support structure, characterised in that each mould unit comprises two side mould parts (2, 3; 40, 45) which can be assembled to define a casting cavity for casting a cistern tank for a water closet suite, one side mould part (2; 40) having a substantially vertical cavity surface (12, 41) for forming the back wall of the cistern tank and the other side part (3;  45) being substantially channel-shaped in plan and having substantially vertical cavity surfaces for forming the side walls and front wall of the cistern tank, one of the side parts having an integral base for forming the bottom wall of the cistern tank, the side mould parts being adapted to be opened and closed by relative movement in a direction longitudinally of the line of mould units, each side mould part being connected in back-to-back relation to the adjacent side mould part of the next adjacent mould unit in the line.   2. an installation as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that, in each mould unit, the base (13) for forming the bottom wall of the cistern tank is provided on the side mould part (12) having the vertical cavity surface for forming the back wall of the cistern tank.   3. an installation as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that each mould unit is provided with a core part (4) which is adapted to be moved in a vertical direction between a position in which the core (20) is located between the side parts and a position in which the core is spaced above the side parts.   4. an installation as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that each core part (4) includes an integral cover which closes the top of the mould cavity when the core is located between the side mould parts.   5. an installation as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that, in each mould unit, the base (49) for forming the bottom wall of the tank is provided integrally with the  side mould part (45) which is channel-shaped in plane.    6. an installation as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that a separate cover part is provided for each mould unit for closing the top of the mould cavity.   7. an installation as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that, in each mould unit, a cover part (42) for closing the top of the mould cavity is provided integrally on the side mould part (40) having the vertical cavity surface for forming the back wall of the tank.   8. an installation as claimed in any one of claims 5 to 7, characterised in that, in each mould unit, there is provided an aperture (55) in the mould base for draining excess slip from the mould cavity.   9. an installation as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, characterised in that there is provided a lifting device mounted so as to be capable of traversing the entire line of mould units, for lifting the core part of each mould unit in turn.
