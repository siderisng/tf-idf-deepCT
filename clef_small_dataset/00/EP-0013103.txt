<ABSTRACT>
an automotive vehicle electrical system includes a  transmitter device (10) which is sensitive to the status of a set  of control switches (s1 to s8) to produce a sequence of digital  words, each containing an address code, a repetition of the  address code, a command code, and a repetition of the com­ mand code.  a set of receivers (a,b,c) are distributed around  the vehicle and each controls a set of loads (la, lb, lc).  each  receiver includes address code recognition logic and operates  to control the associated loads in accordance with the com­ mand code included in the same word as its address code, and  also verification logic for checking that each code is consistent  with its inverse.
