<ABSTRACT>
an electron beam welding machine incorporating an  indexable work table carrying parts to be welded from a  loading position to a welding position under a stationery  electron beam gun and then to an unloading station.  the  parts to be welded are carried in sealable pockets in the table  through a sealed low volume space at atmospheric pressure  into a first pre-pumping station where air in the pocket is  brought to a pressure intermediate atmospheric pressure  and the pressure required during the welding of the parts.   after pre-pumping, the pockets are indexed to a second  pumping station wherein the pocket is evacuated to the  pressure suitable for welding.  the table is then indexed to  another station at the pre-pumping pressure and then  through another sealed space at atmospheric pressure to the  ejection station.  providing sealed spaces at atmospheric  pressure avoids the intake of a large volume of air at  atmospheric pressure into the pumping system.
