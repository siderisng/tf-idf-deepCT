<ABSTRACT>
Substation is a cable clamping device whose essential elements are movable clamping corpers (18, 19) which include a clamping gap (25) between them and their surface parts of rollers (20, 21) with the rope (26) with a toothing (22) and consist with rotationally symmetrical envelope surface. The distance of the rollers is changeable under force, and the rollers are freely rotatable about axes (15, 16). The rope is printed under rotation of the rollers and enlargement of the roll distance in the clamping gap and easily detachably detected there, but slightly releasably releasably in the opposite direction. In the direction of the cable, a blocking takes place, in the opposite direction, the rope can be easily afterward. A protrusion of the rope is the additional effect. Preferably, the axes are arranged at an acute angle to each other and the rollers on the axes in the longitudinal direction are displaceable. Roll pairs can also be more subject. As a possible additional device, an adjustable reference surface for the edition of the rope is provided. As a field of application, sailboats, motor vehicles come into question, load lifts, ski bindings and backpacks.
