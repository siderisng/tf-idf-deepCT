<ABSTRACT>
the still-warm carcasses are sprinkled with an acid solution having a ph between 1,6 and 2,1 containing between 40 and 50% by weight liquid sugar, the remainder being comprised of a salt solution and/or a solution from one or a plurality of organic acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method for the preserving of meat pieces, solution ustln therefor and meat piece preserved according to said method the invention relates to a method for the preserving of meat pieces, particularly freshly-slaughtered carcasses and parts thereof, according to which a meat piece ce to be slaughtered is sprinkled with an acid solution. with known methods of this kind the meat piece is sprinkled with a water solution of an organic acid such as citric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid or ascorbic acid. it is generally known that due to the lowering of the ph-value on the surface of the meat, the bacteria growth is slowed-down in such a way that said meat can be kept longer and this without having to freeze the meat. the keepability of the meat differs according to the selection of the acid used but it is however always relatively limited. the sprinkling with the solution does not avoid the drying of the meat. t'?use of sugar has also been proposed, without however improving substantially the keepability of the meat because the amounts of sugar were not suitable to enhance the desired film forming which is obtained according to the invention. the invention has now for object to provide a method for preserving meat pieces whereby a very long keepability of the meat is obtained and moreover the drying of the meat is avoided. for this purpose, the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution which contains from 30 to 70% by weight of a liquid sugar. in an useful embodiment of the invention, the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution having a ph lying between 9 and 5. in an advantageous embodiment of the invention the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution of liquid sugar the sugar of which is comprised from 5 to 51% by weight of dextrose syrup. the solution comprises from 30 to 70% by weight and preferably from 40 to 60% by weight of liquid sugar. the sugar proper contains from 5 to 51% by weight of dextrose and at least 42% by weight of fructose. preferably the sugar also contains 5.5% by weight of maltose. the sugar can moreover comprise traces of triose and 1.5% by weight of higher sugars. due to a peculiar method for the manufacturing of the liquid sugar syrup and as the case may be also due to a maturing process with enzymes, it is insured that the ph.value of the sugar is always very low, namely about 4.2. there is already obtained by this measure alone the desired low acidity degree of the complete solution the ph of which should be lower than 5. it is even possible by a maturing process with enzymes to further lower the ph of the sugar proper to a ph of 1.5. it is however easier to obtain the very low ph by adding an organic acid. the ph of the complete solution should lie between .9 and 5 but lies preferably between 1.6 and

claims    1. method for the preserving of pieces or meat, particularly of freshly-slaughtered carcasses and parts thereof, in which a meat piece to be preserved is sprinkled with an acid solution, with the characteristic that the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution which contains from 30 to 70% by weight of a liquid sugar.    2. method according to claim 1, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution having a ph lying between .9 and 5.    3. method according to claim 2, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution having a ph lying between 1.6 and 2.1.    4. method according to either one of claims 2 and 3, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution of liquid sugar the liquid sugar of which has already per itself a ph which is lower than 5.    5. method according to claim 4, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution of liquid sugar the liquid sugar of which has per itself a ph of about 4.2.    6. method according to any one of claims 2 to 5, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution which contains besides the liquid sugar, also an edible organic acid.    7. method according to claim 6, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution of a liquid sugar, which solution comprises ' besides the sugar 5 to 50% by weight of an organic acid.    8. method according to claim 7, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution which contains 0 to 15% by weight as computed on the total amount of the solution, of one or more of the acids from the group : lactic acid, citric acid and ascorbic acid.    9. method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution of liquid sugar the sugar of which is compri  sed for at least 42% by weight as computed relative to the total amount of sugar, of fructose.    10.   method    according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution of liquid sugar the sugar of which is comprised from 5 to 51% by weight of dextrose syrup.    11. method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with an acid solution of liquid sugar the sugar of which contains from 4 to 6% by weight maltose.    12. method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the meat piece is sprinkled with a solution of liquid sugar which has a ph-value which lies between 3 and .9 until the ph-value on the meat surface has been lowered to about 4.5.     13. method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which that the solution for the sprinkling is filtered by a filter which makes the solution sterile.    14. method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which that the solution is sprinkled on the meat directly after the slaughtering as said meat is still warm.    15. method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the sprinkling is made under conditions enhancing the forming of a film.    16. meat piece preserved by a method according to any one of the preceding claims.    17. solution for the preserving of meat pieces, which contains between 5 and 50% liquid sugar and has a ph which lies between 5 and .9.
