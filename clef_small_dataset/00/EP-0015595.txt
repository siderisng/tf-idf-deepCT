<ABSTRACT>
a panel mounting electrical fuseholder for cartridge  fuse elements has an electrical contact (4) comprising a  first annular portion (7) a second portion (8) which ex­ tends, substantially perpendicular to the plane of the annu­ lus, outside the body (1) of the fuseholder and a third por­ tion (9) which extends substantially perpendicular to the  plane of the annulus on the same side of the plane as the  second portion (8).  the second portion (8) has a pro­ jecting tongue (10) which engages behind a shoulder (11)  on the fuseholder body (1) to retain the contact (4) in the  fuseholder.  the third portion (9) resists the tendancy of the con­ tact (4) to tip and become dislodged when the terminal  portion (12) of the contact is bent away from the body (1)  to facilitate soldering of a lead to the terminal portion (12).   a skirt (17) is provided on the body (1) to prevent release  of the latching tongue (10) from the shoulder (11) without  the use of a tool.
