<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for compensating moments created by  inertia forces in an internal combustion engine (2) used  for a ship's propulsion comprises a balancer (8) spaced in  the fore-and-aft direction from the engine and including  one or more rotary unbalanced masses (9).  each unba­ lanced mass is driven by a positive displacement hydrau­ lic motor (12) connected through feed and return con­ duits (14, 15) with a positive displacement hydraulic pump  (13) driven by the engine (2) in such a way that the rpm of  the mass is equal to or twice the rpm of the engine crank­ shaft (3) and that a desired phase relationship between  the rotation of the mass and the movements of the oscillat­ ing masses of the engine is maintained.  the hydraulic  drive provides a simpler and cheaper apparatus as com­ pared to known electrically driven balancers.
