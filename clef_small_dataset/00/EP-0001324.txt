<ABSTRACT>
in an ammonia synthesis process at a pressure under 120  bar abs. , ammonia is recovered from incompletely reacted  synthesis gas by absorption in water.  referring to figure 1, unreacted synthesis gas enters at 12  and is dried preparatory in drier 14 to further reaction by  passing it through a charge of regenerable solid absorbent  until that charge is loaded with water and switching its flow to  a fresh or regenerated charge.  during the operation of the  process using gas flow paths a, drier 14 gradually becomes  charged with water.  when drier 14 has become charged to the  design level, the gas flow is switched to paths b.  the loaded charge is regenerated by passing ammonia-containing  reacted synthesis gas through it.  hot reacted  synthesis gas then flows through drier 14 and moist recycle  gas through drier 16.  the displaced water is separated in the  ammonia absorption step.  alternatively a additionally the water content of the  unreacted synthesis gas is decreased by contacting it with  liquid aqueous ammonia at below 0Â°c.
