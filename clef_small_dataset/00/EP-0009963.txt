<ABSTRACT>
a display arrangement is provided with two opposite  display surfaces (2, 3) so that a display can be seen from both  directions.  the display arrangement consists of an evacuated  envelope (1) and fluorescent screens are provided at both  display surfaces (2, 3) which are irradiated by a common  electron emissive cathode (4).  this enables a display  arrangement to be provided which is very thin, but which is  capable of providing very bright displays in an economical  manner.  segmented mesh electrodes (13, 14) are positioned  adjacent to both fluorescent screens so as to selectively conÂ­ trol the regions of the screen which fluoresce, and this enables  the nature of the display to be readily altered.
