<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for heating a concrete element in the course of setting in a mould, by the joule effect, by causing an alternating electric current to circulate in its mass with a view to accelerating its hardening, the said concrete comprising, in its mass, at least one elongated reinforcement passing through the mould lengthwise, the said process adapted to heat the concrete, consisting : - in electrically insulating at least one reinforcement from every element other than the concrete, - in directly establishing a potential difference between each insulated reinforcement and another metallic conducting element in contact with the concrete in such a manner as to cause an electric current to circulate between said element and said insulated reinforcement, through the moist concrete by means of a voltage generator, - and in maintaining the said potential difference as long as the concrete thus heated has not reached a sufficient strength for demoulding, the said process being characterised in that : - the other metallic element consists of the mould ; - an electrical connection is made at a plurality of regions of the said at least one insulated reinforcement, each of these regions being directly connected to one and the same terminal of the generator ; and - the said connection regions are distributed over the length of this insulated reinforcement in such a manner as to distribute the intensity of the current in each of the branch circuits.
