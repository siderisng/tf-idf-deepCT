<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control device for the control of a feed movement of a tool relative to a workpiece in a toothing machine operating after a continuous cutting method, with a drive (43) for the tool and the workpiece and a hydraulic path valve (19) with slider (35) Which controls the supply of pressure fluid to a feed pin Ben (15), wherein by the feed movement, a protective line to be set at a control cam carrier (11) are covered as well as a processing line provided by the control curve (11a) present. In order to avoid damage to the workpiece, tool and machine when adjusting the deployment section, a switch (41) for switching the drive (43) of the tool and the workpiece and a pressure limiter that is switched off or switched on or off. while you cover the processing or deployment line.
