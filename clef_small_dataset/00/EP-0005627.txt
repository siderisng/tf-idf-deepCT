<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an article supporting assembly  that is useful as a toolbox, for shelving, for article display  purposes, and a wide variety of other purposes.  the basic  assembly includes a center structure, at least two spanners,  each having first and second opposite edges, at least two  cover plates, and article supporting structures formed on the  center structure and the cover plates.  each of the spanners is  hinged to the center plate generally along the first spanner  edges and each cover plate is hinged to a spanner generally  along the second edge of the spanner, so that the cover  plates are pivotal from a first position generally parallel to  the center structure (spaced the width of the spanner) to a  second position generally perpendicular to the center structure.   the cover plates may be hinged together along  adjacent edge.  a casing preferably surrounds the center  structure, with a handle formed on the casing.  two sets of  spanners and cover plates may be provided, one on each  side of the center plate, and the center structure may be  mounted on the casing for rotational movement.
