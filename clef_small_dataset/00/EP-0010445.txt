<ABSTRACT>
a lag or stave assembly for a kirschner beater which  replaces the traditional one-piece wooden lags and is prefer­ ably formed from extruded aluminium.  the lag assembly is  formed in two parts with a first support part (19, 21) which is  preferably channel-shaped and can be secured to the free end  of an arm (5) or spider of the beater, and a second pinned  working part (17) removably secured along its leading (29)  and trailing edges (42) to the upper ends (35, 39) of the arms of  the support part, one edge, preferably the leading edge, of the  working part being secured to the support part removably and  hingedly, e. g.  by a hook-shaped tongue (33) engaging in a  mating groove (35), and the other edge being fixedly secured  to the other arm of the support part, e. g.  by means of screws  (31) and or any type of snap-fit or interlock.  the arrangement  preferably ensures that one of the parts is loaded in tension or  compression when the two parts are secured together to  prevent rattling.
