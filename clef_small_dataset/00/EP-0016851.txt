<ABSTRACT>
olefins of two to four carbon atoms are prepared by an  improved fischer-tropsch process, the improvement compris­ ing the use of a catalyst having a surface area less than about  100 m²/g and consisting essentially of:   (1) at least one material selected from the group consist­ ing of the sulfide, oxide or metal of mo, w, re, ru, ni, pd, rh,  os, ir and pt;   (2) at least one material selected from the group consist­ ing of the hydroxide, oxide or salt of li, na, k, rb, cs, mg, ca,  sr, ba and th; and   (3) optionally, a support.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for producing olefins from carbon monoxide and hydrogen this invention relates to an improved fischer -tropsch process for the production of olefinic c2-c4 hydrocarbons. the prior art contains many examples of metals known to be useful in reacting carbon monoxide with hydrogen to produce a variety of compounds -- both hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. these metals include, among others, mo, w, th, ru, re, pd, ni, co, and fe. it is upon the last three of these metals that most commercial experience is based. in the fischer-tropsch syntheses, carbon monoxide and hydrogen are reacted over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds containing from one to as many as one thousand carbon atoms. the hydrocarbons can be aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic. commercial utilization of this synthesis prior to 1950 was accomplished largely in germany and is summarized in storch, columbic, and anderson: the fischer-tropsch and related synthesis, john wiley and sons, new york 1951. the major disadvantages in the prior art processes and catalysts is that most of them are not capable of selectively producing olefins. a process capable of producing olefins of low molecular weight could be usez as a source of feedstock for a variety of petrochemical plants. the present invention is a process for producing hydrocarbons by contacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen at reactive conditions, characterized by contacking the carbon monoxide and hydrogen with a catalyst having a surface area less than 100 m2/g and consisting of: (a) between 1 percent and 95 percent by weight based upon the weight of the catalyst of at least ore material selected from the group con sisting of the sulfide, oxide or metal of molyb denum, tungsten, rhenium, ruthenium, nickel, palla- dium, rhodium, osmium, iridium and platinum; and (b) between 0.05 percent and 50 percent by weight based upon the weight of the catalyst cf at least one material selected from the gre consist ing of the hydroxide, oxide or salt sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, magnesium, -- cium, strontium, barium and thorium. optionally, the catalyst can contain as a third component a support. this invention markedly increases the production of c2-c4 olefins, particularly c3 and c4 olefins. the carbon monoxide required for the process can be obtained from any carbon source, such as from the degradation of coal or of high molecular weight hydrocarbon residuals. the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide ranges generally from at least about 0.25 and preferably about 0.5 to an upper limit of about 4 and preferably about 1.5. process reaction conditions can vary over a rather broad range. the pressure can vary from at least about 1 psig (0.14 kg/cm2) and preferably about 75 psig (5.3 kg/cm2) to an upper limit of about 1500 psig (106 kg/cm2) and preferably about 500 psig (35.2 kg/cm2). the reaction temperature ranges from at least about 2000c and preferably about 3000c to an upper limit of about 6000c and preferably about 4000c. the catalyst is typically either a two-
