<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for separating or enriching gaseous mixtures, in particular isotope mixtures, into fractions of different gravities, preferably for enriching u 235 as uranium hexafluoride, comprising a high-speed disc which has an annular feed zone for the mixture which extends in the radial direction and which is subdivided by at least one slot of an annular die which extends in the radial direction, and the feed zone has downstream of the nozzle slot, approximately within the plane of the slot, an annular discharge channel for the heavy fraction of the mixture extending in the radial direction and, extending to both sides of the slot in the radial direction, annular discharge channels for the light fraction of the mixture, it being provided according to the invention that a plurality of discs (5, 6, 7, 8) are arranged parallel to one another on a common shaft (1) and the outlet channels (13, 14) for the light and/or heavy fraction of the mixture of a plurality of discs are joined together.  <image>
