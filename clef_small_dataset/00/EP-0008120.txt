<ABSTRACT>
a method of locating an object by wave energy reflec足 tion and an apparatus therefor in which receiving outer  transducers (11r, 11l or 111r, 111l) provide directional  receptivities represented by polar lobes diverging on op足 posite sides of a reference axis (15) and an inner receiving  transducer (13 or simulated from 111r, 111l) provide a  directional receptivity represented by a narrower polar lobe  centered on the reference axis.  the signals received from  the outer transducers (11r, 11l or 111r, 111l) are operat足 ed upon in channels (ii, iii) of the receiver to modulate  them with a frequency swept local signal derived from the  transmitted signal and develop indicator signals of difference  frequency between the transmitted and received frequencies  and which represent the range of the object.  the outer  signals are displayed binaurally, to enable the user to  achieve firstly approximate directional sensing by binaural  effect, and thereafter more accurate directional sensing by  the use of signals developed in a central channel (iv) and  derived from the inner transducer (13) or outer transducers  (111r, 111l) simulating an inner transducer.  gain in chan足 nels (ii and iii) fed from the outer transducers is preferably  adjusted as an inverse function of signal strength in the  channel (iv).  higher frequency components are preferably  accentuated in the inner channel to improve object character  recognition.
