claims   1. - new acylureas with pharmacological activity of the general formula i: emi23.1       where r is a group which contains aromatic or heterocyclic nuclii as for example pyridinic or indolic, which may or may not be joined directly to the group ii emi23.2        or separated therefrom by a methylene (which in turn may or may not be   substituted    by a low alkyl group or equally separated from the said. group   by    an oxymethylenegroup, these said aromatic or heterocyclic: groups being substitutable or not by halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine ), by short chain alkyl groups (as for example methyl, proyl ethyl, isopropyl, butyl , isobutyl, etc) , or by lower alcoxyl group.    (as for example methoxy, ethoxyl, etc)     2. -    process . for the obtention of new acylureas with pharmacological activity of the general formula i, as defined in claim 1.   characterized by the adding slowly of a suitable activated form of acid of structure iii  r-cox   iii    where r is the same as in i, and x can be one of any of the halogens, or equally the - group - -o-co-r (where r is the same as in i) , or equally the group -o-r' (where r' is a lower alkali   group    as for example methyl or ethyl, on to a continuously stirred suspension of urea in a solvent which is organic, non   alcoholic,inert    to reagents, or if the radical x is equal to or', a suspension of monosodium urea or of urea in the presence of an adequate quantity of metallic sodium at a temperature of between ambient and the boiling point of the solvent,  keeping up the stirring and the heating for a period of between 1 and 24   hours,    to isolate a precipitate which is an intermediate acylurea of structure iv:  r   -co-nh-co-nh2    iv where r is the same as in i and iii, which precipitate, once washed with the suitable solvents is caused to react with morpholine and a suitable form of formaldehyde within a solvent whose.polarity is not critical , to obtain the acylurea of the general formula i by amino methylation.   3. - process for the obtention of new acylureas with pharmacol ogical activity, of the general formula i as defined in claim 2. characterized because in the event that the compound of starting   iii    be an acid halyde one may alternatively use an acid catalyst as for example concentrated sulphuric acid in the reaction of the obtention of the acylurea of the general formula iv.     in which r is the same as in i and iii, which acylureas iv, once isolated are used as the acid component for the obtention of the acylureas i, in a reaction of amino- methylation with morpholine and a suitable form of formaldehyde (formaline, trioxymethylene, or paraformaldehyde), carried out in a suitable solvent.    the procedure for obtaining the acylureas of the general formula i is the following:  stage a. - obtention of the acylurea of the general formula iv.    add slowly the activated form iii on to a continuously stirred suspension of urea in a non alcoholic organic solvent; inert to reagents, as for example benzene, tuolene, xylene, pyridine, a chlorohydrocarbon derivative, etc.    when . iii is an acid halide, an acid catalyst can be used alternatively, as for example concentrated sulphuric acid, or basis, as for example pyridine or tri ethylamine, in which case it is appropriate to use a quantity of at least the stoichiometric with respect to iii, which acts as the acceptor of the hydrogen halide given off in the reaction.    the selection of the reaction temperature is not critical as the process can take place between ambient and the solvent boiling point, the latter being preferable so as to accelerate the rate of reaction.      the stirring and the heating is kept up for a period varying  from 1 to 24 hours after which the solution is allowed to cool at rest.    a crystaline precipitate is obtained which is   washëd    with the  same solvent used in the reaction, followed with a solution of sodium  bicarbonate then finally with water, thus obtaining the intermediate  acylurea of the general formula iv.    stage b. - obtention of the acylurea of the general   formula    i.    the acylarea thus   obtained    is made to react with morpholine  and formaldehyde in a solvent of which the polarity is not critical,  such that one can use water, acetic acid, dioxane, an alcohol such  as ethanol or isoamylic alcohol or mixtures in varying proportions  of these solvents; the medium can be slightly acid, neutral or basic  and being preferably solvents with lower boiling points.    formaldehyde may be used, either in the form of an aqueous  solution, preferably in a concentration between 35 and 40   so(formaline)    or in the form of trioxymethylene ( in which case the medium must be slightly acid and the reaction times extended) or in the form of paraformaldehyde (polyoxymethylene) in any of its forms.     the mixture of acylurea iv, morpholine, formaldehyde and the solvent is taken to the boil and is so kept during a period varying between 1 and 24 hours.   the product is isolated either by crystalization and filtration of the cold crude from the reaction or by precipitation followed by filtration of the crude poured onto an excess of water.    the product so obtained, of a richness approximating to   900    is purified by obtaining the corresponding   hydrochlori de;    for this one  disolves in an organic solvent such as alcohol, dioxane, or a hydrochloride derivative and causes to bubble,a   stream    of hydrogen chloride across the organic solution until total   precipitation1 or    one adds a   stoechiznwetric    quantity of concentrated hydric chloride acid to the said solution.
