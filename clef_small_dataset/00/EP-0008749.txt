<ABSTRACT>
For a recipient for with a shaft (20) versable fastener (19), such as nails, screws, pins or the like., is between the magazine (18) in which both loosely and strips connected fasteners can be guided and theA discharge channel (14) arranged a divider member (23) which controls the feeding of the fastener (19) to the ejection channel (14) as a function of the movement of the driving conveyor (15).Advantageously, the departmental member (23) is operated by a compartment piston (24) which is impaired from the return stroke air for the return stroke of the firing conveyor (15).By a locking device (31, 32) on the departure member (23), it is determined so that in addition to loose fastening to strips connected fasteners are processable.Thus, the retractor according to the invention can be used universally for all types of fasteners with a simple control assembly for the departmental body (23).
