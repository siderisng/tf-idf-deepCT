<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a system for reducing steam  throttling losses which occur across turbine governor valves,  by adjusting boiler throttle pressure so as to obtain  optimum govenor valve setting thereby providing for maximum  power production efficiency.  in a typical valve grouping  sequential positioning pattern, the flow rate  is assumed to be f3 where valves 1, 2 and 3 are fully open  causing substantially no throttling losses; however, valves 4  and 5 are partially open causing some losses.  an optimum  valve position program (56) is operative to determine optimum  flow demands corresponding to optimum valve positions  (72 and 71) which are greater and less than the present  flow demand.  then, the closest optimum flow demand, e. g.   (72) is selected.  based on this optimum flow demand, a  throttle pressure control program (34) adjusts throttle  pressure setpoint so that the governor valve (4, 5) positions  change to (72).  a major advantage of this invention  is fuel savings due to maximum time spent in the optimum  valve position conditions.
