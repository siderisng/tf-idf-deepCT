<ABSTRACT>
a device compensating the movement of a cinemato­ graphic film through cameras or projectors, the film  being moved continuously; a plurality of inverting  reflectors, typically amici prisms (70), move-determined  by a straight line segment (74) of a track (72) -in and  parallel to the same direction of the film at half the speed.   film (20) is illuminated over a width of at least one and a  half frames using a condenser lens (18).  a number of  partial images are reconstituted forming the projected  image; the composite frame generally consists of two or  three adjoining partial images.  the invention includes drums with 90° mirror  finish helical grooves, prisms arrays mounted on cater­ pillar tracks, discs having corner cube indents, optical  roofs in a plane surface thereof and circularly arranged  around or having slots therein, with prisms slideably within,  the slots extending tangentially causing the prisms to  move in a straight line.
