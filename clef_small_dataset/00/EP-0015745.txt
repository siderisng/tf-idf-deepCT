<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula  r₁ and r₂ are independently hydrogen, chlorine or vari­ ous organic groups;   r₃ and r₄ are independently c₁-c₃ alkyl; and n is zero, 1 or 2,  exhibit arthropodicidal and nematicidal activities.  the compounds can be formulated for use in convention­ al manner.  they can be made by reacting a carbamyl fluoride    with an appropriate dioxime, or by reacting an oxime roh  with an appropriate bis (carbamyl fluoride).
