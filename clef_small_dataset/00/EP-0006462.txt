<ABSTRACT>
an electronic directional control circuit (34) includes  apparatus (36) for producing first and second command signals,  apparatus (38) for producing first and second outputs in  response to the first and second command signals, and  apparatus (40) for delaying production of a preselected one of  the first and second outputs a preselected time sufficient for the  selected output to decrease to a preselected magnitude prior to  the production of the other of the first and second outputs.  the  electronic directional control circuit (34) is useable with vehicles  (10) which initiate the command signals with a foot operated  pedal while leaving the hands free for simultaneously operating  other controls.
