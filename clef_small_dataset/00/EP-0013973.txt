<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for holographically processing  optical signals in a fiber-optic sensor system.  in the present  invention, holographic processors are utilized in various  combinations with light sources, fiber-optic transmission  means, sensors and detectors to provide low cost, com­ pact, sensitive and accurate sensor systems.  by means of the holographic processors of the present  invention, the aforementioned sensor systems are used to  monitor such physical parameters as temperature, pres­ sure, flow-rate, and the like, and to provide output signal  indications thereof that are compatible with digital  receiving stations and immune to electro-magnetic inter­ ference, hazardous atmosphere, and the inimical effects of  inadvertent intensity variation due to equipment vibration  and the like.  in one typical embodiment, a pair of holographic pro­ cessors are employed in a color multiplex-demultiplex sen­ sor system in which a first holographic processor is em­ ployed to color multiplex a sensor signal and a second  holographic processor is employed to decode the color-­ multiplexed signal into a binary pattern that is then trans­ mitted onto a set of photo-detectors.  in each of the embodiments of the invention disclosed,  a unique geometrical orientation of a hologram is utilized  to minimize spurious signal interference that would other­ wise hamper or totally preclude the holographic proces­ sing.
