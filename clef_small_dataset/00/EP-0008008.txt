<ABSTRACT>
1.  a thyristor having at least three superimposed semiconductor layers (1-4) of different conductivity types, in which the semiconductor layers which are arranged at the ends of the series, are provided with end face electrodes (5, 6) connected in an electric circuit, in which the semiconductor layer (4), which is arranged at one end of the series, does not cover a section of the surface of the adjoining, penultimate layer (3), in which an area (7) of the non-covered section of the surface of the penultimate layer (3) is covered with a thin, electrically insulating layer (8a) on which a gate (9) connected to a control terminal (g) is arranged, and in which at the distance of the channel length of a field effect transistor adjacent to the edge of the layer (4) which does not completely cover the penultimate layer, there is arranged a zone (2a) having the same conductivity type as said layer (4), characterized in that the zone (2a) penetrates the penultimate layer (3) up to the interface with the following layer (2) which has the same conductivity type as the zone (2a), so that an ignition current running by way of the zone (2a) can be produced between the end electrodes merely by means of control value supplied to the gate (9).
