<ABSTRACT>
a laminated multilayer material composed of (a) a layer  of a graft-modified ethylene resin grafted with an unsatur­ ated carboxylic acid or a functional derivative thereof and  (b) an oxygen- or nitrogen-containing polar resin layer or a  metal layer in contact with the layer (a); wherein the layer  (a) consists of   (i) 1 to 100% by weight of graft-modified ethylene resin  containing up to 15 mole% of at least one alpha-olefin and  has an mi₂/[η]-8. 77 ratio of not less than 15 and a density of  0. 88 to 0. 98 g/cm³, and   (ii) 99 to 0% by weight of an unmodified ethylene  polymer containing 0 to 50 mole% of at least one alpha-­ olefin and having an mi₂/[η]-8. 77 ratio is absolute value of  not less than 15 and a density of 0. 86 to 0. 96 g/cm³, such  that the layer (a) has (a) an ethylene content of not less than  80 mole%, (b) a content of the carboxylic acid or derivative  of 0. 01 to 10% by weight, (c) a density of 0. 88 to 0. 98 g/cm³,  and (d) an mi₁₀/mi₂ ratio of from 5 to 18, wherein mi₂ and  mi₁₀ are melt indices at 190 °c under loads of 2. 16 kg and 10  kg, respectively and [η] in the intrinsic viscosity (dl/g) at  125 °c in decalin solution.  the laminated material is particu­ lar suited for use as packaging or building material.
