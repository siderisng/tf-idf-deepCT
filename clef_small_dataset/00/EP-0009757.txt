<ABSTRACT>
melt compounded polyamide resins blends of a nylon  resin and a small amount of an adduct which contains a  requisite amount of anhydride functionality.  the adduct  polymer is found to provide nucleating effects to the resul­ tant blend.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
polyamide resins and process for preparing the same nucleating agents are usually employed as processing aids primarily to accelerate crystallization from a melt. acceleration of crystallization results in faster molding cycles, which of course means greater productivity in molding operations. generally, nucleatina agents are believed to provide sites for crystallization of molten polyamide. however, nucleating agents are also identified bv their ability to increase tensile strength and stiffness of the polyamide, dear2 se elongation, and decrease mold shrinkage the term "nucleating agent" as employed herein, is meant to denote those additives which increase tensile strength and decrease tensile elongation and mold shrinkage. a deficiency of many nucleating agents is' that they also significantly lower the izod impact strength of the resin compared with that of the polyamide without nucleating agent. in contrast, the nucleating agents employed herein provide nucleating properties to polyamides but do not result in a significant lowering of izod impact strength. summary of the invention the product of this inventicn is a melt compounded blend consisting essentially of a) a polyamide resin having a molecular weight of at least 5000, and b) an adduct of maleic or fumaric anhydride and a copolymer of ethylene, at least one c3 to c6 a-olefin, and at least one nonconjugated diene, said adduct having an anhydride functionality of between about 0.1 and 4.0 milliequivalents of carboxyl groups per 1 gram of adduct, said adduct being present in the blend in an amount such that the anhydride functionality comprises between about 0.9 and 10 equivalents per 106 g of polyamide present; provided that the maximum amount of adduct present is less than 1 percent based on weight of polyamide and adduct. the process of this invention is a process for preparing the melt compounded blend described above by mixing the polyamide resin and the adduct and melt extruding the mixture. description of the invention the polyamide resins used in the blends of this invention are well known in the art and embrace those resins having a molecular weight of at least 5000 and commonly referred to as nylons. suitable polyamides include those described in u.s. patents 2,071,250; 2,071,251; 2,130,523; 2,130,948; 2,241,322; 2,312,966; 2,512,606; and 3,393,210. preferably, the polyamides are those made by the condensation of linear diamines represented by the fornla h2n-(ch2)x-n32, where x is a integer between 6 and 1x, with linear diarboxlic acids represented by the formula i02c-(ch2)y¯co2ht where y is an integer between 2 and 8. equally well, these polyamides may be m.aze from amine-formlng derivatives of said amines and acids such as esters, acid chlorides, amine salts, etc. representative dicarboxylic acids used to make the polyamides include adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, and dodecanedioic acid, while representative diamines include hexamethylene diamine and octamethylene diamine. examples of polyamides include polyhexamethylene adipamide (66 nylon), polyhexamethylene azelamide (59 nylon), polyhexamethylene sebacamide (610 nylon), and polyhexamethylene dodecanoamide (612 nylon), polycaprolactam, (nylon 6), polylauryl lactam, poly-ll-amino-undecanoamide, bis-(paraaminocyclohexyl) methane dodecanoamide. it is also possible to use polyamides prepared by the copolymerization
