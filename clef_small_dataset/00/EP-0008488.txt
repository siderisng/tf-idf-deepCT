nitrogen oxides are removed from gaseous mixtures by  treatment with an aqueous solution of nitric acid having a  concentration by weight from about 35% to about 58% and  containing by weight at least 0. 001% but less than 25% of  hydrogen peroxide whereby the nitrogen oxides are conÂ­ verted to nitric acid.
