<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to coprecipitated cobalt-silica hyd­ rogenation catalysts which are prepared by preparing an  aqueous reaction mixture containing cobalt cations, silicate  anions and solid porous carrier particles under agitation to  form a coprecipitate of the cobalt and silicate ions onto said  solid porous support particles; heating the aqueous reaction  mixture; and adding an alkaline precipitating agent to precipi­ tate further the cobalt and silicate ions onto said solid porous  carrier particles.  the aqueous reaction mixture may addition­ ally include copper cations.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to coprecipitated cobalt silica catalysts and their use in hydrogenating organic com pounds. this invention also relates to the prep aration of supported coprecipitated cobalt-silica catalysts furthermore, this invention relates to the use of the catalysts, in reduced form, to hydrogenate organic compounds. the catalytic reduction of organic compounds in tc-. presence of nickel and cobalt catalysts is known. nickel catalysts, especially supported nickel catalysts, have many commercial uses. for example, u.s. patent 3,535,271 teaches the use of a nickel catalyst promoted by copper for dehydro genation, cracking, reforming, polymerisation, isomerisation, alkylation, as well as other treating processes. other exam- ples of nickel catalysts and their use in reforming and other processes include u.s. patent nos 2,750,261; 3,205,182; 3,351,566; 3,417,029; 3,697,445; 3,859,370; 3,868,332; 4,088,603; and belgian patent no. 841, 812 (which generally corresponds to u.s. application serial no. 577,328). in all of these patents, the catalysts are prepared by copre cipitation or impregnation processes wherein the catalytic metal precursors are either precipitated from solution in the presence of a support material or solution containing said precursor or impregnated into the pores of a porous support material. in the british patent no. 1,220,105, for example, aqueous solutions are employed in conjunction with a homogen eous precipitation procedure to give highly dispersed nickel catalyst. d.j.c. yates, w.f. taylor and j.h. sinfelt (j. am. chem. soc., 96,2996 [19641) described a chemisorption tech nique and its utility in correlating nickel particle size (and/or nickel surface area) with catalytic activity. in i- ure 3 of their publication, there is shown that a direct rcla tion exists between reduced nickel surface area (m2/g of catalyst) and initial reaction rate for ethane catalytically converted into methane (as mmoles c2h6 converted per hour gram of catalyst). it follows, then, that methods which in crease the nickel surface area of a nickel catalyst (other factors such as nickel content remaining constant) is a desir able feature, loading to a catalyst of: improved catalytic activity. patentees of u.s patent mos. 3,697,445; 3,859,370 and 3,868,332 also appreciated tat by achieving a higher degree of dispersion of nickel in the catalyst results in a more active catalyst and indeed they obtain a fairly high degree of dispersions by their coprecipitation techniques wherein nickel cations were gradually precipitated from an aqueous solution in the presence of silicate anion and solid porous particles to obtain dispersion greater than 70 m"jg of reduced nickel metal per gram of catalyst. belgian patent no. 841,812 teaches that the addition of copper ions during the precipitation step provides a catalyst that can be reduced at temperatures of approximately 2000c. u.s. patent o. 4,088,603 discloses an improved method of activating t coprecipitated nickel-copper-silica catalysts. a number of patents have disclosed cobalt cobalt ' nickel and cobalt-nickel-copper catalysts, e.g., u.s. patent nos. 3,166,491; 3,385,670; 3,432,443; ,547,830; 3,650,713; 3,661,798; 3,945,944; 4,014,933 and 4,026,823; and british patent nos. 1,000,826; 1,000,829; 1,095,996; 1,095,997 and 1,182,829. none of these patents, however, disclose copre cipitation of cobalt salts and silicate ions in
