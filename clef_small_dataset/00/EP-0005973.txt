<ABSTRACT>
a package strapping tool in which both tensioning  means and means for joining overlapping ends of a loop of  metal strapping are operated by pneumatic or hydraulic  fluid-pressure, has a time-delay device which initiates the  jointing operation, the timing cycle of which is started by the  application of fluid-pressure to the tensioning means.  fluid-pressure  applied to the tensioning means is also applied to a  valve chamber (119) and through an adjustable restrictor  (113) to a chamber (112).  the gradually rising pressure in the  chamber (112) is applied to the top of a piston (116) the shank  (117) of which abuts a pilot valve disc (118) biassed to the  closed position by fluid-pressure in the valve chamber (119).   when the pressure in the chamber (112) reaches a predetermined  value after a time-delay determined by the setting of  the restrictor (113), the piston (116) opens the pilot valve disc  (118) and admits fluid-pressure through a port (126) to a  sealing valve controlling the jointing means.  in a modification, a piston of the time-delay device is  subject to supply pressure on one side and the flow of fluid  out of the cylinder on the other side of the piston is restricted.   the piston moves slowly along the cylinder and at the end of  its stroke engages and opens a pilot valve of a servo system  controlling the jointing means.
