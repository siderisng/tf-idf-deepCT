<DESCRIPTION>
title tri-iodoalkenyl esters of n-substituted carbamic esters their preparation and their use as biocides this invention relates to biocides and more particularly to biocidal trijodoalkenyl esters of n (substituted)hydrocarbylcarbamic acids, their preparation and their use. us patent specification no. 3923870 discloses compounds having the formula: [ ic=c-(ch2) n0] m r wherein r is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl1 aryl or alkylaryl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and having from 1 to 3 linkages corresponding to m, and m and n are whole number integers from l and 3 and may be the same or different. these compounds have fungicidal activity, and are particularly useful as paint film fungicides. according to the present invention there are provided compounds having the formula: [i2c=ci(ch2)nocohe]m r wherein r is alkyl1 cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkylaryl having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and up to m linkages each r being unsubstituted or substituted by a group selected from hydroxy, lower alkoxy and halo and in and n are independent integers from 1 to 3. examples of the groups represented by r are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isoropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-octyl, n-dodecyl, n-hexadecyl,- n-octadecyl, 2-chloroethyl, 1-bromoethyl, 2-methoxyethyl, 2-ethoxyethyl, 2-n-butoxyethyl, cyclohexyl, allyl, phenyl, 2-, 3- and 4- methylphenyl, 2-, 3- and 4-ethylphenyl, 2-, 3- and 4-chloro (or bromo)phenyl, 3,4-dichlorophenyl, 2-, 3- and 4-methoxy (or ethoxy) phenyl, benzyl, 2-phenylethyl, ethylene, tetramethylene, hexamethylene, isophoran-di-yl, phenylene, chlorophenylene, tolylene, methylene bis(4-phenylyl) and toluene-2,4,6-tri-yl. preferred groups represented by r are optionally substituted lower alkyl, c2-c6alkylene, monocyclic aryl and monocyclicarylene. according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds having the formula: [i2c=ci(ch2) n0jm r wherein r, m and n have the meanings stated above, which comprises reacting a triiodoalkenol having the formula: i c=ci(ch ) oh 2 2n with an isocyanate of the formula r(nco)m the triiodoalkenols having the above formula in which nis 1, 2 or 3 are known compounds. triiodoallyl alcohol and 1,1,2-triiodobut-l-ene-4-ol are mentioned in volume 1 of beilsteins handbuch der organischen chemie at pages 440 and 442 respectively. l,l,2-triiodopent-l-ene-5-ol is disclosed in chemical abstracts, volume 26, page 2166 (1932). this process can be carried out by methods which are well known in the urethane art. thus, the isocyanate may be added to the triiodoalkenol at a rate such that the reaction temperature is readily controllable, if desired with the aid of external cooling. the reaction may be carried out in the absence of a solvent, or a solvent which is inert to isocyanate groups may be used. examples of suitable solvents are esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone and 4-methoxy-4- methylpentan-2-on e, hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene, methylene dichloride, l,l,l-trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene, and polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl formamide and dimethylacetamide. there may also be used a catalyst of the kind which accelerates reaction between an isocyanate group and a hydroxyl group.
