<ABSTRACT>
drum brake having a hydraulic actuator (18) cooperating  with a pair of brake shoes (14, 16) to urge the latter to a  position in engagement with a rotatable drum during braking,  an adjustment mechanism of the type including an extendible  member (10) engaging the pair of brake shoes (14, 16) to  define a non-braking position for the brake shoes, a resilient  member (18) cooperating with said brake shoes to urge them  toward their non-braking position, a pawl (22) pivotally  mounted relative said extendible member (20) and  engageable therewith to provide extension of said member in  the event of excessive movement of said brake shoes  between their non-braking and engagement positions.  said  pawl including one arm (30) engaging said extendible  member (20) and another arm (32), said other arm (32)  defining an arcuate abutment (34) and a pocket (40), said  abutment (34) in part defining said pocket, said actuator (18)  having an arcuate recess pivotally receiving said abutment  (34), one of said brake shoes (16) terminating in an end (38) of  arcuate shape, said arcuate brake shoe end being pivotally  received in said pocket (40) whereby said pawl (22) is pivoted  relative said one brake shoe (16) and said actuator (18) upon  brake actuation to provide for extension of said extendible  member (20).
