<ABSTRACT>
a method of separating acrylic acid from an aqueous  solution containing acrylic acid, comprising adding a salt  that eliminates the eutectic point between acrylic acid and  water, for example an alkali metal salt, in particular sodium  chloride, to the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to  saturate the aqueous solution, and fractionally crystallising  the aqueous solution to obtain acrylic acid.  the fractional crystallisation is preferably carried out in  from three to six stages, and leads to a product which  contains more than 99% of acrylic acid and less than 0. 02%  by weight of added salt, for example sodium chloride.
