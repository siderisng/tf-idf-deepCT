<ABSTRACT>
a partial opening patch top closure member 6 of a composite container, including a body portion mounted on one end of the container and a pull tab portion 4 connected with one edge of the body portion, is characterized by the provision of a tear-initiating cut 8 in at least one of the junctures between the pull tab and body portions, whereby the tab portion may be pulled to tear a removable portion from the body portion, thereby defining a dispensing opening in the residual body portion.  in the preferred embodiment, a single tear-initiating cut is provided in one juncture between the body portion and an asymmetrically or symmetrically arranged pull tab portion that is pulled laterally to tear the removable body portion for the residual body portion.  in a second embodiment, the patch top closure member includes a symmetrically arranged pull tab portion which defines a pair of junctures each having a tear-initiating cut, whereby upon pulling the tab upwardly, the pull tab and removable portions are torn away from the body member along converging lines of tear.  one or more score lines may be provided in the body portion of the closure member to more accurately define the lines of tear.  a plastics overcap may be provided.  <image>
