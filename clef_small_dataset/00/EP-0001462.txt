<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method for building a marine  structure by building the upper structure thereof on land  or in shallow water, by loading this onto a semisubmersible  catamaran-shaped vessel, which may be ballasted and deballasted  to have a wide range of height positions while in  the water, by bringing this vessel to the lower structure of  the marine structure in deep water, so that this vessel  straddles said lower structure, and by then lowering the  vessel to discharge the upper structure onto the lower  structure.  the invention also relates to means to take over  the upper structure at the building site by a pontoon, from  which it is in another area taken over by the catamaran-shaped  vessel, and to a method for building up the upper  structure from modules and for completing this structure.   moreover, the invention relates to such catamaran-shaped  vessel itself and to the structure thus built and handled.
