<ABSTRACT>
a cooling means (10) for a furnace, particularly a blast  furnace, is mounted to the furnace by means of a bellows (26),  the rear end of which is attached to a collar (24) surrounding  one or more of the conduits (20) for cooling water and the  front end (28) of which is adapted for attachment to the fur­ nace shell (32) or a member (30) rigid therewith.  in this way  the cooling element (10) is firmly and sealingly mounted in the  furnace shell (32), the bellows (26) allowing movement of the  element with respect to the shell caused by settling of refrac­ tory material (34) in which the cooling element is located.
