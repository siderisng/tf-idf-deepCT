<ABSTRACT>
a method of forming a permanent curve in a length of  convoluted wire-reinforced flexible plastics tubing (1) com­ prises the steps of first flexing the chosen region of the tube  (1) into a curve whose radius is tighter than that eventually  desired, forcibly holding said region in said tighter-than-­ desired curve, applying to the tube an internal pressure which  is insufficient to burst the tube but which is high enough to  strain the wire-reinforcement (2), the tube material, (1) or  both, in the bend region beyond its or their elastic limit;  maintaining said internal pressure for a finite period of time;  releasing the pressure; and finally releasing the tube (1) from  its preheld curve.
