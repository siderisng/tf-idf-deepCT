<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for producing spark ignition of an internal  combustion engine, comprising an ignition coil having  primary and secondary windings (1a, 1b), a capacitor (c) connected  to the primary winding (1a), voltage generating means  (4) for receiving a supply voltage (5:12v) and arranged to  charge the capacitor to a voltage greater than the supply  voltage, switching means (scr) arranged to cause the  capacitor (c) to discharge through the primary winding (1a)  and thereby produce in the secondary winding (1b) a voltage  pulse for producing spark ignition of the engine, and control  means (8) arranged to apply to the output of the secondary  coil a direct current capable of sustaining a spark established  by said voltage pulse.
