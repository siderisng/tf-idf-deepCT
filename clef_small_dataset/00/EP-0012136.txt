<ABSTRACT>
an electro-mechanical transducer suitable for use in  a cot bed to detect body movements comprising a resilÂ­ iently compressible assembly which emits noise while  being compressed or expanded and a microphone (12) for  detecting the noise thus produced thereby to permit of  the control of alarm or signal means.   the device is particularly designed to give warning of  cessation of breathing movements of infants while asleep  with the objective of reducing the incidence of so called  "cot deaths".

<DESCRIPTION>
detecting body movements. this invention relates to apparatus for detecting body movements and to alarm or signal means controlled thereby and, while not restricted thereto, has been devised primarily with the objective of reducing the incidence of so-called "cot deaths" which now are a major component of the statistics of infant mortality during the first few months of life. while the cause of cot deaths has not yet been clearly established, there are remedial measures which could be taken to prevent or reduce them if the parent or other person in charge of the infant, could quickly become aware that breathing had ceased. however, such deaths usually occur at night, unaccompanied by warning sounds, so that in many cases, some hours elapse before it is discovered that the infant has died. for similar reasons apparatus, primarily intended for monitoring the breathing of a premature infant in a hospital incubator, and which is adapted to sound an alarm if breathing should cease, has already been devised, but such known apparatus is relatively complex and expensive and these disadvantages militate against its use in the home where most cot deaths occur. it is therefore the general object of this invention to provide simple, convenient and relatively inexpensive means for detecting body movements, and to provide alarm or signal means for use in conjunction therewith. accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides an electro-mechanical transducer suitable for use in a cot or bed to detect body movements, especially movements of the chest wall, comprising a resiliently compressible assembly which emits no ice while being compressed or expanded, and a microphone for detecting the noise thus produced thereby to permit of the control of alarm or signal means. in use the microphone is connected in circuit with "hold-off" means which prevent activation of one or more associated alarm or signal devices ile the transducer is producing substantially continuous noise. in the event however that such noise should cease for a predetermined short period, e.g., a period of several seconds, the said alarm device or devices, e.g., a lamp and/br a loud-speaker or bell, is or are automatically energized to alert the person in charge. thus an alarm circuit controlled by said holdoff means, may include a red signal lamp, and a loudspeaker while also means may be provided whereby other signal means, e.g., a green signal lamp, is automatically energized when the transducer is in use and is functioning normally. in order however that the invention may be more fully understood, one preferred form thereof is hereinafter described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- fig. 1 is a perspective view of a transducer responsive to breathing movements. fig. 2 is a sectional view in plan of the transducer and is drawn to an enlarged scale. fig. 3 is a perspective view of a jacket suitable for attaching the transducer to an infant; and fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of one form of alarm apparatus for use in conjunction with the transducer.
