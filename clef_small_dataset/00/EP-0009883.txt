<ABSTRACT>
a self-crimping continuous-filament yarn comprises  latent-crimp filaments having a periodic variation in denier  greater than ± 15% about a mean value combined with fila­ ments having a lower shrinkage than the latent-crimp fila­ ments.  each of the latent-crimp filaments is made by con­ verging two individual molten streams travelling at  different velocities and quenching the resulting combined  streams to form a combined filament.  the lower-shrinkage  filaments are spun simultaneously and both kinds of fila­ ments are withdrawn at a common spinning speed in excess  of 2200 meters per minute.  on developing the crimp there is  produced a novel yarn having high bulk and a wool-like hand  comprising developed crimp filaments having a periodic var­ iation in denier greater than ± 15% about a mean value  combined with longer filaments protruding from the yarn in  loops.

<DESCRIPTION>
self crimping yarn, - process for producing a self insing yarn, and textured yarn having a wool-like hand the invention relates to the art of melt-spun syr,thetic yarns and processes for their production, and more particularly to such yarns which combine high bulk with a wool-like hand. it is.known to produce somewhat bulky yarns by combining filaments with different shrinkages into a.yarn, then shrinking so that the resulting longer filaments protrude in loops from the yarn. this may be done by spinning the filaments from different polymers, as in reese u.s. patent 3,444,681, or by spinning from different filament crosssections from a common polymer, as typified by several patents. such known yarns ordinarily do not have high bulk, nor do fabrics made therefrom ordinarily provide a hand similar to that of-wool, combining an initial crispness on light touch with softness on more firm compression. these and other difficulties of the prior art are avoided by the present invention, whichprovides novel and useful processes and improved yarn products. according to a first major aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for producing a self-crimping yarn comprising first and second types of filaments, the process comprising spinning the first type of filaments by generating first and second individual streams of molten polymer of fiber-forming molecular weight, the individual streams travelling at different velocities; converging the individual streams side-by-side to form a combined stream; and quenching the combined stream to form a combined filament; spinning the second type of filaments by extruding a third stream of molten polymer of fiber-forming molecular weight from an orifice selected to give a filament with lower shrinkage than said combined filament, at a given common spinning speed; and quenching the third stream into a filament; withdrawing the filaments from the streams at the given common spinning speed in excess of 220q meters per minute; and combining the filaments into a yarn. according to another aspect, each of the streams is of polyester polymer. according to another aspect, the spinning speed is selected such that the yarn has a shrinkage below 20%. according to another aspect, the spinning speed is selected such that the yarn has a shrinkage below 8%. according to another major aspect of the invention, there is provided a multifilament yarn comprising first and second classes of filaments, each of the first class of filaments having a periodic variation in denier of greater than + 157 about mean value and possessing latent crimp; each of the second class of filaments having lower shrinkage than the shrinkage of the filaments of the first class. according to another aspect, each of the second class of filaments has a denier larger than the average denier of the first class of filaments. according to another major aspect of the invention, there is provided.a muitifilament yarn comprising first and second classes of filaments; each of the filaments of the first class having a periodic variation in denier of greater than + 15% about a mean value and possessing
