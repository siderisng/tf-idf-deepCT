<ABSTRACT>
a high-frequency converter of push-pull form comprises  a centre tapped d. c.  input supply (16, 17, 18,) two solid state  switching devices (20,21) connected in series across the d. c.   input terminals, a load circuit including a supersonic fre­ quency transformer (30) and an output rectifier (35), and an  oscillatory circuit including at least one capacitor (40) and a  parallel inductor (34) connected in parallel with the primary  winding (37) of the transformer between the centre tapping  (19) of the supply and the junction (25) of the switching  devices.  the switching devices are synchronised to the oscil­ lation of the oscillatory circuit to allow the circuit to oscillate  freely for part of a cycle to transfer energy from the inductor  (34) to the capacitor (40) to charge the latter to a certain  condition in which the voltage across the parallel inductor is  substantial and that across the switching device is negligible  and only then connect the parallel inductor across the d. c.   input terminals whereupon the parallel inductor receives and  stores energy from the said supply.  means such as a saturable  reactor (33) are connected in series in the load circuit to  restrict load current to a low value during a part of the cycle in  which the capacitor receives energy from the parallel inductor  and until the capacitor is charged to the said condition and the  switching means has connected the load circuit across the  supply.
