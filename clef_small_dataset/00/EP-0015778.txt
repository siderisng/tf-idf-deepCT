<ABSTRACT>
a flat circular parachute canopy, or a conical or he­ mispherical canopy, which may have an extended skirt and  with the canopy of gore construction has external gores  (3) of porous material covering selected canopy gores and  arranged to ensure circular balance of the canopy.  each  external gore covering is mounted on radial seams of the  canopy gore which it covers, beginning at a point above  the canopy skirt and extending along the radial seams and  across the apex hem, to define a compartment for accept­ ing external air flow turbulence existing on the elongated  «just deployed» canopy prior to normal inflation.  the ex­ ternal gore is closed at its top and incorporates an anti-­ oscillation vent.

<DESCRIPTION>
description parachute with inflation assistance device the object of this invention is the provision of a parachute having a non-mechanical, non-pyrotechnic device to ensure the full, rapid and uniform inflation of a parachute canopy deployed at altitudes above ground level which are in the 60 to 90 metre range. accordingly the invention provides a parachute having a circular canopy of gore construction wherein adjacent canopy gores are joined by radial seams extending from the skirt of the canopy to the apex, characterized by further comprising external additional gores of porous material covering selected canopy gores with that end of each said external additional gore which is nearer to the skirt terminating at a location spaced from the skirt of said circular canopy; and means joining the radial edges of each said external additional gore to said circular canopy along the adjacent radial seams at the sides of the respective canopy gore which it covers, the width of said external additional gore being greater than that of said respective canopy gore to define therebetween a compartment extending generally radially of the canopy with the end of said compartment nearer the apex of the canopy closed and the other end of said compartment open. the parachute inflation assistance device, when applied to flat, circular canopies, or conical or hemispherical canopies of gore construction, should rapidly open the canopy, initially at the skirtthereby compelling the canopy to fill from the skirt upwards to the apex in a rapid filling sequence. the partially entrapped column of air, in the compartment defined between an external gore and the canopy gore which it covers. increases the buoyancy of the canopy since the upper end of this compartment is closed and the lower end is open. an anti-oscillation vent or slot may be provided in the device to effectively eliminate oscillation common to conventional circular canopy designs. for example, excellent canopy balance may be achieved by the construction of external gore coverings on every fourth gore on a 28 gore canopy, and every sixth gore on a 30 gore canopy a beginning with either gore number 1 or the highest numbered gore. in order that the present invention may more readily be understood the following description is given a merely by way of example a with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: figure 1 shows a "just deployed" conventional canopy; figure 2 shows a canopy in accordance with the present invention in the same "just deployed" state; figure 3 shows schematically the folded skirt of a conventional parachute in the packed state; figure 4 shows the action of two inflation assisting devices on gores 14 and 28; figure 5 shows the action of a further two inflation assistance devices on gores 7 and 21; figure 6 shows a side elevational view of a conventional gore; figure 7 is a side elevational view of the parachute inflation assistance device used to cover the gore of figure 6; ; figure 8 shows an elevational view of the inflation

 claims    1. a parachute having a circular canopy of gore construction wherein adjacent canopy gores are joined by radial seams extending from the skirt of the canopy to the apex± characterised by further comprising external additional gores (3) of porous material covering selected canopy gores (7) with that end of each said external additional gore (3) which is nearer to the skirt terminating at a location spaced from the skirt (8) of said circular canopy;  and means joining the radial edges of each said external additional gore (3) to said circular canopy along the adjacent radial seams at the sides of the respective canopy gore (7) which it covers, the width of said external additional gore (3) being greater than that of said respective canopy gore (7) to define therebetween a compartment extending generally radially of the canopy with the end (13) of said compartment nearer   the    apex of the canopy closed and the other end of said compartment open.    2. a parachute according to claim   1±    characterised in that said end of each said external additional gore- (3) nearer the canopy skirt (8) terminates at a location of substantially   40    cm above the skirt (8) of said circular canopy.    3. a parachute according to claim 1 or   2,    characterised by further including an anti-oscillation vent slot (11) provided in each said external additional gore (3) substantially 96 cm below the apex of said circular canopy.        4.    a parachute according to claim   3,    characterised in that each said vent slot (11) extends approximately 12 cm along the longitudinal centre line of said external additional gore (3) and is approximately 6.5 mm in width.    5. a parachute according to any one of the preceding   claims a    characterised in that at the apex hem the width of each said external additional gore (3) is calculated at a ratio of 2:1 to the width of said respective canopy gore (7) and said external additional gore flares downwardly along the radial seams of the said respective canopy gore (7) so that adjacent the lower end of said external additional gore the said ratio is 1.22:1 to the width of the said respective canopy gore.    6. a parachute according to any one of the preceding   claims a    characterised by including retention lines (10) attached to the portion of each said external additional gore which is nearer to said canopy skirt at spaced apart locations on opposite sides of the longitudinal centre line of said external additional gore and extending to and being attached to the adjacent suspension lines (9) for the said respective canopy gore (7).     7. a parachute according to claim   6,    characterised in that the canopy is a conical or a flat circular canopy and said retention lines (10) are substantially 76 cm in length.    8. a parachute according to claim   6,    in which the canopy is hemispherical and characterised in that said retention lines (10) are substantially 112 cm in length.    9. a parachute according to claim   6,    7 or   8,    characterised in that said retention lines (10) are attached to the lower portion of each said external additional gore (3) at locations spaced approximately  10 cm to either side of the longitudinal centre of said external additional gore.
