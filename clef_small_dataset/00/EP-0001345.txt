<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the selective removal of salts  from aqueous solution by the use of polyethers.  polyethers  complex with cations so that some normally water soluble  salts may be rendered soluble in organic solvents.  where the  anion is hydrophilic this is not possible.  this applies to common  inorganic anions.  accordingly the polyether is adsorbed  on carbon and the salts form a complex with the polyether.   the polyether may be eluted from the caron with an organic  solvent.  the salt may then be eluted from the carbon using  water.  different salts are adsorbed to different degrees and  can be selectively separated.  preferred polyethers are cyclic  oligomers of ethylene oxide.  the invention is particularly useful  for the removal of chlorides and nitrates from aqueous  solutions.
