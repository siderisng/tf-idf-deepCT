<ABSTRACT>
method for splicing exposed stereo cine-films (8) wherein two separate tabs (2, 3) are releasably applied to a transfer (4) and then, by wrapping the transfer around one film edge, are applied from opposite sides to the film ends to be joined together, whereupon the transfer is peeled off to leave the tabs on the film ends.  the transfers (4) and tabs (2, 3) are held together releasably on the carrier tape (1), from which they can be peeled off together and wrapped around the film ends.
