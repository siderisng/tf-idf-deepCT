<ABSTRACT>
the substituted theophyllines of the formula:    (wherein r¹, r² and r³, which may be the same or differ­ ent, each represent alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of  3 to 7 carbon atoms, phenyl or phenylalkyl of 7 to 10 carbon  atoms, each of which may be unsubstituted or substituted by  one or more hydroxy groups, alkoxy or alkylthio groups of 1  to 4 carbon atoms, halogen atoms, cyano groups, nitro  groups, carboxy groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups of 2 to 5  carbon atoms, amino groups, alkylamino groups of 1 to 4  carbon atoms or dialkylamino groups of 2 to 8 carbon atoms,  or when the group is pehnyl or phenylalkyl, by one or more  alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms;   or r² and r³ together represent a hydrocarbon chain of 3  to 6 carbon atoms optionally interrupted by a heteroatom;   and n represents an integer from 1 to 6)   and the acid additional salts thereof, are novel com­ pounds which are useful in the treatment of cardiac disor­ ders.  processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical  compositions containing them are also described.
