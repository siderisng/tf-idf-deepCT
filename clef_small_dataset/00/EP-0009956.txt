<ABSTRACT>
a releasable lock mechanism is provided in combination  with a stationary first member (11) and a second member (14),  the latter being adapted to assume various selected positions  of rotary adjustment with respect to the first member (11).  the  lock mechanism includes a first lock component (15) carried  by one of the members and a complemental pivotally adjust­ able second lock component (17) carried by the other  member.  the second member (14) is disposed at a selected  position of rotary adjustment with respect to the first member  (11), and retains the second member (14) in the selected posi­ tion.  the second lock component (17) is adapted to be manu­ ally shiftable relative to its pivotal axis and away from the  peripheral pocket of the first lock component (15) to effect  unlocking of the lock components (15,17).  the locking  mechanism is particularly suitable for locking the rear end of a  truck or similar vehicle to a loading dock during loading and  unloading.
