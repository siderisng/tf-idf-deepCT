<ABSTRACT>
a chain, particularly for a track-laying vehicle, has a pair  of link chains which are maintained in spaced parallel rela­ tionship by shoes secured to the respective links of the link  chains.  the shoes have central lugs (18) for engagement by a  drive sprocket.  each link chain is formed from a series of links  (16).  each link (16) has at one end, a socket (23) and, at the  other end, a pin (24) which is received in the socket of an  adjacent link.  the pin defines a reservoir (27) for containing  lubricant for lubricating the pivot joint defined by the pin and  socket.  a crescent seal (36) defines a moving seal for coopera­ tion with a fixed seal (30, 31) between an end cap (29) and the  socket end (21) of the link for preventing leakage of the lubric­ ant.
