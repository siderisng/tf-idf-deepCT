<ABSTRACT>
The semiconductor device for resistive trucks in highly integrated circuits provides in a silicum semiconductor body against each other insulated areas, within which a first type of conductor adjacent to the semiconductor surface is arranged from the first conductivity type, among which a highly doped buried relative to the first initially doped sampled second semiconductor region (38) of the opposite , second conductive type extending, wherein for the electrical connection of the buried area with the semiconductor surface at least one third semiconductor amount (40) is carried out of the second conductor type. As a resistance with a high layer resistance value, the near-surface first semiconductor region and in a preferred embodiment may be used in addition to the semiconductor material present below the second semiconductor region. The manufacturing rate of this semiconductor device allows up to a late process stage, the optional utilization of such a semiconductor device as an additional transistor structure as part of a so-called masterlice concept.
