<ABSTRACT>
a polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit  an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature which enables it  readily to undergo melt processing to form quality fibers,  molded articles, etc.  the polyester of the present invention is  different in character from earlier polyesters and includes as  essential ingredients moieties    derived from para-hydroxy benzoic acid, 1,2-bis(para­ carboxyphenoxy) ethane, terephtalic acid, and unsubstituted  hydroquinone in certain specified proportions.  the polyester  of the present invention can be produced on a relatively  economical basis and has been found capable of yielding an  anisotropic melt of relatively low viscosity at a desirable  temperature for melt processing.  in a preferred embodiment  the polyester is capable of undergoing melt processing at a  temperature below approximately 300°c. , and in a particular­ ly preferred embodiment at a temperature below approxi­ mately 290°c.  (e. g.  with standard equipment commonly used  for the melt processing of polyethylene terephtalate).  fibers  conveniently can be melt spun from the polyester of the  present invention which exhibit tenacity values which are  enhanced to a surprisingly great extent upon thermal  treatment.
