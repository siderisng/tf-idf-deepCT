<ABSTRACT>
fully cured reinforced moulded resins such as poly足 esters, polyurea urethanes, polyureas, polyurethanes, poly足 isocyanurates polyepoxies and polycarbonate resins can  be in-mould coated to cover surface defects such as sink  marks and microcracks with an improved coating composi足 tion comprising reactive liquid polymers, a vinyl monomer  and certain cross-linkable unsaturated ester resins as co足 polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
in-mould coating com ositions containing functional group terminated liquid polymers the present invention relates to moulded thermosetting plastic articles and especially fibre reinforced plastic articles and more particularly to coating compositions and methods for applying them to cover surface defects such as sink marks, porous areas, microcracks and open knit lines. the invention is more particularly directed to stable liquid coating compositions having extended shelf life which can be used as a single system for coating cured compositions, are particularly useful when applied to moulded substrates that have improved adherence, and can be substituted for a sanding and primer coating operation normally required for such uncoated articles prior to painting. in-mould coating, compositions and methods of application are well-known and in particular are described in british patent 1,457,935. such processes require injecting a resin compound mixed with reinforcing fibres, usually glass fibres, in the form of either a sheet moulding compound or a bulk moulding compound into a shaped mould, compressing the mould to form the desired part applying heat to cure the resin, opening the mould slightly, injecting a coating composition to fill the space between the substrate and the open mould face, closing the mould slightly to squeeze the coating uniformly over the surface to a thickness of less than 0.5mm usually from 0.01 to 0.13mm and curing the coating. in the present state of the art, the coating compositions are derived from a two component system which when mixed begins to polymerise and normally gels within a few hours or days at which point it becomes useless as an in-mould coating composition. furthermore, such two components require exact metering and measuring at the point of their use in order to derive a satisfactory coating having uniform properties and curing times. the coating compositions presented hereinafter provide the sheet moulder with a single mix composition which has stability for six or more months when stored under normal conditions and requires no accurate mixing of ingredients prior to use as an in-mould coating. the invention provides therefore a method of forming a compression or injection moulded, fully cured, reinforced thermoset article with a compression or injection moulded coating having a smooth surface, superior adherence and adequate hardness. the invention also provides a compression or injection moulded completely cured reinforced thermoset article having a compression or injection moulded coating. the invention also provides a moulding composition useful in providing a superior compression or injection moulded coating having superior adherence smoothness and durability when applied to a compression or injection moulded completely cured reinforced thermoset article. the coating composition according to the invention comprise a liquid mixture of an unsaturated polyester or polyurethane resin, a copolymerisable monomer and a functional-group-terminated liquid polymer having the general formula: emi2.1 wherein y is -oh, an aliphatic hydroxyl group-containing radical of 2-10 carbon atoms, a vinyl group-containing radical of 2-10 carbon atoms or a univalent radical obtained by removing hydrogen from an amine group of an aliphatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic amine containing at least
