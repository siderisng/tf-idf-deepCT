<ABSTRACT>
particulate fabric washing detergent compositions are  made with mixed phosphate detergency builders which comÂ­ prise at least 5% of discrete particles of a water-soluble alkali  metal polymer phosphate and at least 2% of an alkali metal  orthophosphate in the ratio of 10:1 to 1:5 parts by weight, the  total amount of these phosphates being from 10% to 40% of  the composition and not more than 10% of other phosphate  builders being present.  the compositions are conveniently  made by spray-drying a base powder and then admixing the  polymer phosphate in discrete particle form with the base  powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
detergent coilpositions the present invention relates to powdered detergent compositions which are adapted for fabric washing, and which contain synthetic detergent active compounds together with mixed phosphate detergency builders. the invention concern in particular the production of detergent compositions which contain levels of the mixed phosphate detergency builders which can be lower than conventional phosphate builder levels but which still retain good detergency properties. according to the present invention, a particulate detergent composition based on mixed phosphate detergency builders comprises a synthetic anionic, nonionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compound or mixture thereof. w alkali metal orthophosphate, and discrete particles of alk- metal or ammonium polymer phosphate. the invention includes a process for the preparation of the detergent composition, which comprises forming a deterrent base powder containing some or all of the detergent active compound or compounds and optionally some of the alkali metal cr rtiophosphate, and admixing an alkali metal or ammonium polymer phosphate in discrete particulate form with the base powder. preferably the base powder is prepared by spray drying in the normal way using conventional equipment and process conditions. however, other conventional techniques may be used for preparing the base powder containing some or all of the detergent active compound or compounds and of the alkali metal orthophosphate. other heat-sensitive ingre.2ients may be admixed with the base powder together with or separately from the alkali metal or ammonium polymer phosphate, for example oxygen bleach compounds such as sodium perborate. in ue patent no.-1,530,799 we described powdered fabric washing detergent compositions which essentially contain mixed alkali metal tripolyphosphate and alkali metal orthophosphate detergency builders in the ratio of from 1o:i to 1:5 parts by weight. these compositions were found to have surprisingly good detergency properties though containing lower levels of the phosphate detergency builders than in conventional sodium tripolyphosphate-based detergent compositions. this development enabled either a reduction in manufacturing cost because the difference in phosphate content could be made up with a cheaper filler, or an improvement in overall detergency by adding extra bleach or other additive instead. additionally, this development facilitated the achievement of decreased phosphorus levels in detergent products to meet present or expected legislation. products of the type described in our aforementioned patent have already met with appreciable commercial success, especially as economy brands. however, one potential problem which has been found with the detergent compositions based on mixed alkali metal tripolyphosphate and orthophosphate builders, is the level of inorganic deposits which aresometimes fount onwashed fabrics and to a lesser extent surfaces in washing machines, especially heater elements. the present invention is directed to decreasing the level of such deposits whilst retaining benefits of good detergency building properties whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the partial or complete replacement of the sodium tripolyphosphate in the detergent compositions of our aforementioned patent by the alkali metal or ammonium polymer phosphate gives less inorganic deposition on the washed fabrics, because the polymer phosphate has a decreased tendency to degrade to alkali metal pyrophosphate
