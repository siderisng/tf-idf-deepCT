<ABSTRACT>
an electron multiplier has many channels  (5), defined by plates 6, common to all the channels, which  are spaced apart along the channels and extend across the  channels.  the plates have portions 11 bent out of them to  define dynode surfaces, leaving apertures 12 for the passage  of electrons through the plates.  each portion serves  as a dynode for one channel only so dimensional errors in  that portion affect only one channel.  in each plate the same  surface of the plate serves as a dynode surface for all the  channels, so there is no variation in emissivity between the  channels at that plate.
