<ABSTRACT>
a metal raceway section providing an electrical wiring  distribution system in fill-on-slab or fill-on-grade constructions.   the metal raceway section comprises a corrugated  element presenting alternating lengthwise troughs and  lengthwise flutes connected by common webs.  capping  means (12, 13) are provided which enclose a lengthwise  trough (18) and a lenthwise flute (17a) whereby the raceway  section provides first and second wiring passageways.   the raceway section also provides at least one passageforming  lengthwise flute (17b) adapted to cooperate with  a surface presented by a substructure (21) - slab (22) or  grade (23) - which supports the raceway section thereby  to form an additional wiring passageway.
