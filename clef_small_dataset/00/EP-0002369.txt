<ABSTRACT>
an aerator for the treatment of liquid by immersion in  the liquid to form in the liquid a liquid stream and introduced  gas bubbles.  the stream is to be produced with efficient use  of power to have sufficient bubbles small enough to avoid  waste by bubbles reaching the surface too quickly.  the  areator has a pressure chamber (49), with a liquid inlet and  gas inlets (422) positioned between the liquid inlet and a  restricted outlet throat (47) associated with a chamber wall  surface (44) arranged to direct an outlet stream deflected  from the liquid inlet direction.  the aerator can be formed  without immersed moving parts by two tubes, a smaller  inner one (41) expanding towards an outer larger one (42) to  define the throat and pressure chamber and wall surface.   the gas supply is applied through holes large enough to  resist algal obstruction at a position where the gas and water  enter a part of the pressure chamber of reducing cross-section  for subsequent deflection out of the throat.
