<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic bearing system provided with a stator part  (2), rotor part (1) and servo system (16 - 20) arranged to  regulate the electromagnetic action whereby the stator part  (2) and rotor part (1) are held at certain distance from each  other.  in said servo system use is made of electro magnetic  sensors (11 - 15) by means of which variation in distances  results into electric control signals on the basis of which the  distances between rotor (1) and stator part (2) being controlled.   the principle of the present invention is to derive such  control signal by electro-optical means i. e.  by fiber optical  means (11 - 15) for conveying light rays along separate paths  to and from an interval between the stator and rotor part of  the bearing system.
