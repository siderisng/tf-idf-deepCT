<ABSTRACT>
a process and a device for gluing materials with curable  aminoplastic adhesives with separate application to the joint  of a resin component of the adhesive and a hardener  component containing an acid or an acid-forming substance.   the application is simplified and the separate application on  one and the same joint surface of both components is made  possible by first applying the hardener component in the  form of an aqueous solution to the joint surface by means of  a roll which is porous and capable of absorbing hardener  composition and that the resin component is subsequently  applied to the same joint surface.  preferably this is also  applied by means of a roll.  a suitable device for carrying out  the process comprises a roll having a porous and absorbing  material on its surface and a dosage roll which is in contact  with this and between which rolls the hardener component is  supplied.

<DESCRIPTION>
j uésv ad de5sjice for gluing with aminoplastic- ±-sl) give systems technical field the rr-sert invention relates to a process and a device iol gluing with curable aminoplastic adhesives çjnereby a resin component and a hardener component, containing an acid or an acid-forming substance, are sepa ately applied to the joint. background of the invention it is well known that in the work with curable ad- adhesive systems problems of pre-curing often arise ciuring the application of the adhesive and during the assemblying of treated parts before the pressing. the problems are particularly pronounced when fast adhesive systems must be used, e.g. when short run-through times in the press are required or when hot-pressing cannot be used. if a ready-mix of resin and curing agent is used, it is necessary to clean the mixing and application equipment often, and sometimes as often as every twentieth minute, in order to avoid pre-curing problems. this pre-curing which occurs after mixing but before application of the adhesive mixture also shortens the available assembly-time before the pressing operation, which means that it is cessary to compromise about the press time which cannot be made as short as would be possible otherwise. it is known that these problems to a great extent can be avoided by separate application of the resin component and the nardener component respectively to the joint, whereby at least some of the cleaning problems are avoided. the best utilization of the curing time of the adhesive system is obtained if the adhesive components are kept separate until the assembling, e.g. by spreading the resin component on one of the surfaces of the joint and the hardener component on the other. in many cases it is, however, not possible to apply the components in such a manner that they are kept separate up to the assemblying of the joint surfaces but the resin and the hardener component must be spread and mixed on the same joint surface, even if they are applied to this independent of each other. at e.g. veneering, or other types of lamination with thin layers, the thin materials often cannot stand a transport-through and treatment in an application equipment and direct application of an adhesive or adhesive components on thin materials can furthermore cause visible penetration of glue on to the other side of the materials. nor is it, from a practical and economical point of view, always possible to treat both joint surfaces. in order to utilize other advantages of the separate-application technique in those cases, it is previously known to first apply the resin component on one of the joint surfaces in the form of a layer and then to strew a powdered hardener on this resin layer. the use of a curing agent in powder form in this manner is, however, not.free from problems. it is difficult to obtain a uniform layered distribution of the powder and the strength will then easily become uneven and visible shades on thin materials will often appear. the tendency
