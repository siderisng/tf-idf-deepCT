<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiation-sensitive coating composition and their use for the preparation of a negative resist image, which remains as a protective coating on integrated circuit slabs. The radiation-sensitive coating composition comprises reaction products from an epoxidized non-linear novolak with at least 6 terminal epoxide groups and monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid from the group of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid and mixtures thereof; a polyethylenic unsaturated compound; A photoinitiator, if necessary, another hardener and a diluent for adjusting the desired viscosity. The coating compositions according to the invention have excellent image forming and film-forming properties. The problem of scattering that is due to excessive shrinking of the coating during developing does not occur with you, and also the compositions result in the minimum layer thickness loss during development and hard.
