<DESCRIPTION>
deschiption this invention relates to coating compositions. more particularly, the invention relates to polymeric, high solids coasting1 compositions adapted to provide an automotive topcoats. because of increasingly strict solvent emissions regulations in recent years, low solvent emission paints have become very desirable. a number of high solids paint compositions have been proposed to meet these low solvent emission requirements; however, many of these compositions are deficient because of difficulty of application, slow curing rates, lack of flexibility, poor durability and low solvent and water resistance. many of the proposed compositions have been particularly deficient as automotive topcoats. the present invention provides a coating composition which comprises: (a) a hydroxy bearing oligoester (i) having a number average molecular weight (mn)-of between about 150 and about 3000, (ii) bearing at least about 2 hydroxyl groups per molecutle, .and.(iii) being formed by an esterification reaction between a carboxylic acid and an epoxide; and ( a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent having an average of at.least two reactive isocyanate groups per molecule, and being included in said coating composition in an amount sufficient to provide between about .5 and about 1,6 reactive iso-anate groups per hydroxyl group present in'said composition. in addition, the coating composition of the invention may include additives, catalysts, antioxidants, u.v. absorbers, flow control or wetting agents, antistatic agents, pigments, plasticizers, solvents, etc. preferably the thermosetting coating compositions of this invention preferably contain greater than about 50% by weight, and most preferably greater than 70% by weight of nonvolatile solids. the preferred compositions of the invention are particularly suitable for those applications requiring high gloss, hardness, durability, and high solvent and water resistance as well as a fast cure rate at relatively low temperatures, e.g., between about 200c. and about 1300c., preferably between about 750cm and about 100 c, each of the components of the high solids ting compositions of the invention, the amounts of each of the components required to achieve the desired results of the invention and methods for applying the composition are described hereinafter in greaterdetail. hydroxy functional oligoester one of the two principal components in the high solids coating compositions of this invention is a hydroxy functional oligoester (i) having a number average molecular weight (mn) of between about 150 and about 3,000, preferably between about 230 and about 1000, (ii) bearing at least about 2 hydroxyl groups per molecule, and (iii) being formed by an esterification reaction between a carboxylic acid and an epoxide. exemplary of the hydroxy functional oligoesters useful in compositions of the invention are; (i) the esterification reaction product of a polycarboxylic acid, i.e. a carboxylic acid bearing 2 or more carboxyl groups, and a monoepoxide; (ii) the esterification reaction product of a polyepxoide, i.e., a compound having 2 or more epoxide groups and a monocarboxylic acid and (iii) the esterification reaction product of a hydroxy functional carboxylic acid and a mono- or polyepoxide. the first type of hydroxy functional oligoester noted abode is rcfzrably prepared li by :eacliny aqproxi- mately 1 to 1 equivalent
