<ABSTRACT>
a method of recovering non-ferrous metals from their  ores comprises introducing the ore into a molten sulphide  carrier that is forcibly circulated through an extraction circuit  (11), including an ore disposer (10) and an oxidiser (15) conÂ­ tacting the molten carrier containing the dissolved or melted  ore with oxygen in the oxidiser (15) to oxidise at least part of  the ore or carrier, recovering heat thereby generated by the  molten carrier, and transmitting the heat by means of the  carrier to endothermic sites in the circuit.
