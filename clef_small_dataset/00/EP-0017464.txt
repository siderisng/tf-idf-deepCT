<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for endoscopic photography (1) includes a  camera (3) and a light source unit (4) which may be coupled  to an endoscope (2) to permit a picture to be taken of the  interior of a coeliac cavity.  an operating signal is converted  into a high frequency signal by means of a conversion circuit  which is disposed in one of the camera (3) and the light  source unit (4), a recovery circuit for recovering the operating  signal from the high frequency signal being disposed in the  other of the camera and the light source unit.  in this manner,  a communication of the operating signal between the  camera (3) and the light source unit (4) is enabled through  d. c.  feed lines (12a, 12b) disposed within the endoscope  which are utilized to feed a film winding d. c.  motor.
