<ABSTRACT>
cation exchange processes can be carried out by  treating liquids containing ionic impurities with particles,  optionally in emulsion in aqueous media, of cation exchange  resin which comprise approximately spherical beads of  crosslinked copolymer having diameters of 0. 01 to 1. 5  micrometers and bearing 0. 7 to 1. 5 cation exchange func­ tional groups per monomer unit.  the particles  may be removed from the treated liquid by flocculation.  the  particles or emulsions thereof may be made by emulsion  polymerization followed by functionalization, in some cases  after, in some cases at the same time as, and in some cases  without, coagulation of the emulsion polymer to form coag­ ulum particles of the copolymer beads which may, if nec­ essary, be subsequently redispersed in liquids.  emulsions  of the strong acid resins and particles of the weak acid  resins in the free base form, both as such and in emulsions  are also claimed.
