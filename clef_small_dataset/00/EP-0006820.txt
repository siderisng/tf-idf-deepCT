<ABSTRACT>
METHOD AND DEVICE FOR MANUFACTURING THE CULTS OF AGEGE OF AGGLOMERED WOOD COMPRISING A BODY AND AT LEAST ONE WALE OR WING RELATING TO THE BACKGROUND WITH AN IMPORTANT ANGLE. A tablecloth of particles are prepared by robeblying a small amount of binder, a pretty compression of the portion or parts are carried out to form said wall or wing so as to obtain a precompited sheet whose bottom (14) has a thickness. significantly greater than the thickness of the parts to form said walls or wings (26), the sheet is introduced into a mold into at least two parts whose imprint, when the mold is in the compression state, has at least one Pre-first part (24) extending substantially perpendicularly to the branch of the two mold parts, and a second portion (27) extending according to said important angle compared to the first part, in a much closer direction of the management of the rapprochement, and the final compression is then carried out, then the polymerization.
