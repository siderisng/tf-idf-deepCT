<ABSTRACT>
A textile sheet (13) has a non-woven fiber layer (7), which contains from each other delimited ball yarn (8) of spherically intricate fibers (9), which by means of needles by means of retaining fibers (10) on a carrier layer (12), for example, nonwoven fabric are attached. The ball yarns (8) have in front of the needle round shape and are therefore free, for example, whereby they can be stored in metered form on the carrier layer (12). As a result of the spherically intricate, in sufficiently loose forming fibers (9), the ball yarn (8) are actively needle-capable. Through their shape, the ball yarn (8) give the textile sheet (13) an inconsistent surface (20), so that depending on the size, fiber type and arrangement as well as color of the ball yarn (8), for example, a structured and / or color-patterned surface (20) For textile materials, for playing floor or wall covering, sleeping blankets, trimming, decorative or furniture or for insulation purposes in front of the plane.
