<ABSTRACT>
conventionally volatile esters such as ethyl acetate are  produced by continuously feeding an alcohol and an acid  to an esterification reaction still containing an esterification  catalyst, removing the ester and water so produced over­ head by distillation and returning a proportion of the ester  product as reflux to the distillation section in order to  maintain the reaction mixture essentially anhydrous.  in the  process of the invention, instead of operating the esterifi­ cation still at atmospheric pressure as in prior art proces­ ses, superatmospheric pressure, typically in the range 1. 38  to 13. 8 bar absolute, is employed.  this results in higher  ester production rates.  although the process is applicable  to the production of esters from either ethanol, n-propanol  or iso-propanol and acetic, propionic and butyric acids,  ethanol and acetic acid comprise the preferred feedstock  typically the reaction temperature is in the range 110 to  160°c.  esterification catalysts include sulphuric acid and  toluene-para-sulphonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the production of esters employing superatmospheric pressure the present invention relates to a process for the production of an ester and in particular to a process for the production of ethyl acetate. a conventional process for the production of volatile esters of a primary alcohol and a carboxylic acid consists of continuously feeding the alcohol and the acid in substantially equimolar quantities to a reaction still operated at atmospheric pressure. the reaction still invariably contains an esterification catalyst in the form of a strong mineral acid such as sulphuric acid. the ester produced thereby is recovered by distilling overhead an ester/water azeotrope. an essentially anhydrous composition is maintained in the reaction still by returning ester product phase, separated by decantation from the aqueous product, to the top of the column to give a reflux ratio of about 3:1. such a process is described in the complete specification of our british patent no 1173089. virtually complete conversion of alcohol to ester is thereby achieved and the ester product typically contains 42% w/w alcohol which simplifies its downstream purification on the other hand the use of such a high rate of reflux return is undesirable because the production capacity of the reaction still is approximately inversely proportional to the reflux ratio used. it is therefore a desirable objective to reduce the reflux ratio whilst maintaining high conversion and low alcohol content in the ester product and, as a result, correspondingly increase the production capacity of the still. vapour/liquid equilibrium data reported by merriman et al in jcs, p 1797 and p 1814, (1913) indicates that the water content of the ethyl acetate:ethanol:water azeotropes is increased from ca 9 to 10% w/w by increasing the pressure from 14.7 to 28 psia. it would therefore be expected that increasing the pressure would correspondingly increase the water content of the overhead ester product which would permit a corresponding reduction in the minimum reflux ratio required to remove water overhead whilst maintaining the reaction mixture essentially anhydrous and would correspondingly increase the production capacity of the still. the effect of increasing pressure on the kinetics of the reaction is not reported but the same vapour/liquid equilibrium data indicate that the ethanol content of the ternary azeotrope is also increased from 8.4 to 12.1% w/w by increasing the pressure from 1 to 1.93 bars. it may therefore also be expected that increasing the pressure would correspondingly and disadvantageously increase the alcohol content of the overhead ester product thus increasing the difficulty in downstream purification of the ester. we have now found that superatmospheric pressure operation of the esterification reaction still surprisingly leads to no substantial increase in the alcohol content of the ester product removed overhead. furthermore the vapour velocity in the column is correspondingly decreased, thereby potentially allowing a further significant increase in ester production rate. moreover the increase in production rate at the higher still pressures observed in the production of ethyl acetate can be extended to the production of other esters which
