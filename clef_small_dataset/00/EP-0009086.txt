<ABSTRACT>
1.  a device for th semi-automatic insertion of a paper into a typewriter (10) of the kind having a platen (12), a keyboard (20) for generating coded signals and a paper holder (12, 72) defining a paper feed path and cooperating with a printing device to establish a print line, an operator manipulable paper hold-down device (13) urging the paper against the platen (12) in the character printing area, which can be placed in a first position at the paper path and in a second position away from the paper path, a line feed device (50) for incrementally advancing the paper along said paper feed path in response to line feed control signals applied thereto, and a store (44, 44') for storing an operator-entered distance code signal representing the distance to be covered by the paper along said paper path to reach a desired first print line, said device being characterized in that it comprises : a detector (32) for detecting the presence of said paper hold-down device (13) in said second position and for generating a corresponding detection signal, said signal having a first level when the paper hold-down device (13) is in its second position and a second level at the time the paper hold-down device (13) is moved away from its second position while remaining away from the paper path, a logic circuit (36, 30) for controlling the store (44, 44') in such a way that, in response to either said first level of said detection signal or to the second level reached by the signal when the paper hold-down device (13) is moved away from its second position while remaining away from the paper path, the store (44, 44') issues the stored distance code signal and supplies a corresponding set of line feed control signals to the line feed device (50) to cause the latter to insert the paper until the desired first print line is reached.
