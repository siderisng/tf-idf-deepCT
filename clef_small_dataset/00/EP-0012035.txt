<ABSTRACT>
sensors for the analysis of analytes in liquids are known.   conventionally many such sensors require an external reference  cell.  the invention provides an electrochemical sensor  with a built-in reference.  in particular, a sensor of the invention  includes a pair of electrodes (95a, 95b) the first electrode  being electrically connected to a permeable layer (91a) containing  a given concentration of the species to be measured,  and the second electrode being electrically connected to a  permeable layer (91b) which is either free from species, or  contains an amount thereof different from that in the first  layer, the second layer being accessible (in use of the sensor)  to the liquid sample under assay.  the invention also provides  an array of sensors for simultaneous analysis of a multiplicity  of analytes in a liquid sample, at least one sensor in the array  being as defined above.
