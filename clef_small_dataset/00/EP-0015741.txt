<ABSTRACT>
a folding framework for a wheelchair has side frames (19,  20) interconnected by front and rear toggle braces (22, 22a)  each preferably formed from a pair of u-shaped arms of spring  wire and a linkage (27) extends between the hinges of the tog­ gle braces.  a latching arm (28) is latchable with the linkage (27)  to hold the structure in an erected condition, the arrangement  being such that the side frames are maintained parallel to one  another.  direct drive motors (23, 24) may be mounted on  wheels (25, 26) and to facilitate folding the hinges of the toggle  brace may be offset relative to the fore and aft line of the vehi­ cle so that when folded the side frames are offset relative to  one another and the motors overlap.  preferably a diagonal  brace (34) extends below the folding framework to maintain  parallel alignment of the side frames and the latching arm co­ operates with the linkage between the toggle braces so that on  lifting the latching arm, the linkage and the toggle braces are  displaced in the closing direction.
