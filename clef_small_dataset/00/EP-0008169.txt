<ABSTRACT>
pyrolysis of a hydrocarbon feedstock, for example  naphtha, is carried out by subjecting the feedstock to ele­ vated temperature during passage through a reaction cham­ ber, which is for example one or more tubes arranged hori­ zontally or vertically such as a cracking coil.  the reaction  chamber is disposed within a fluidised bed of hot inert  particles which are heated by firing a solid, liquid or gaseous  fuel.  a heavy fuel oil, for example pyrolysis fuel oil, is the  preferred fuel.
