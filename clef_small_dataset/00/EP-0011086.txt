<ABSTRACT>
a still photographic film unit (1) including a disc (3) of  photosensitive material rotatable about a central axis for  receiving a plurality of image frames (4) in an annular region  concentric with the axis.  a core (2) of opaque material is  secured in a central aperture in the disc (3).  the core (2) has  associated with it magnetic recording material which may be  particulate material dispersed throughout the entire, or a reg­ ion of, the core (2) or it may be included in a laminar element  such as an adhesive tape or annular element applied to the  core (2).  the magnetic recording material serves to carry  information applied at various stages throughout the life of  the film unit (1).  the information can be retrieved for assist­ ing in photographic processes such as exposure, processing,  printing and handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
still photographic film unit the invention relates to disc-shaped still photographic film units. in u.s. patent specification no. 2,531,652 there is described and illustrated a film unit which consists of a disc of photosensitive film rotatable about a central axis for receiving a plurality of images in an annular region concentric with said axis. that film unit has to be loaded into a camera in darkness because no cartridge, magazine or other form of housing is provided. the need exists to record information in fixed relation to photographic film at various times throughout the life of the film in such a manner that it can be recovered at a later time in the film's life. for example, it may be desired to record information such as the film speed, whether the film is black and white or color, the designation of the appropriate process for developing the film, and the emulsion number, before the film is marketed. it may be useful for some of that information (for example film speed) to be retrieved in the camera in order to set the exposure controls of the camera. when a photograph is taken it may be desirable to record information about the image, for example whether or not flash was used, and what was the nature of the ambient lighting, e.g. was it natural or incandescent or fluorescent. when a film is given to a dealer for processing, the dealer may wish to record information in relation to his business, so that the processor returns the film to the right dealer, and in relation to the customer, and in relation to the nature and number of the prints required of each latent image. the processor might also want to record information, for example in relation to the dealer and the nature and number of the prints desired, and perhaps also in relation to the exposure used for each print. the processor wants to use much of the above mentioned information, for example process designation, when processing, and flash/no flash and lighting information and nature and number of prints required, when printing. when assembling the prints and film for return to the dealer he will want the dealer and customer information. par of this information recording and retrieving cycle may be repeated later if a reorder of prints from existing negatives is made. the film unit disclosed in u.s. patent specification no. 2,531,652 does not provide in addition to the photosensitive recording medium, a recording medium to which information may be added and from which information may be retrieved throughout the life of the film. the present invention overcomes the above mentioned disadvantage of the prior art by associating magnetic recording material with a core of opaque material secured in a central aperture in the disc. the magnetic recording material associated with the core provides a recording medium to which information may be added and from which information may be retrieved throughout the life of the film unit. because the magnetic recording material
