<ABSTRACT>
a dual beam spectrophotometer includes a radiation  chopper (5) and a monochromator (3) which includes a  diffraction grating driven by a stepper motor.  the chopper  (5) includes a gate pulse generator (24) which produces  gate pulses gs and gr which correspond to periods during  which radiation from the source (2) passes through a  sample cell (19) and a reference cell (14) respectively.  a stepper motor drive circuit (134) produces pulses  to step the stepper motor which are synchronised with the  chopping cycle by means of the gr and gs pulses.  the  stepper motor is arranged to step an equal number of times  in each half of a chopping cycle.  a further condition which is preferably satisfied is that  the first pulse of a sequence should start in the opposite  half of the chopping cycle from that in which the first pulse  started in a previous chopping cycle.  at low stepping rates  the motor will step twice in one chopping cycle and then  pause for several cycles before again stepping twice.
