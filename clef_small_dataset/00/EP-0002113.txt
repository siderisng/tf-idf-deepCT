<ABSTRACT>
first and second housing parts (11 and 12) are fixed  together in spaced relation with a disc-like contact member  (14) having wire gripping slots (54) rotatably mounted  between them.  the slots have mouths (53) aligned with  wire receiving passageways (23, 33) in the first and second  housing parts.  tabs (51) on the contact member (14) are  locked in recesses (44) in a third housing part (13) rotatably  mounted on the first housing part (11) by cooperating  ribs (42) and groove (16) and defining a cavity enclosing  the second housing part (12) and contact member in a  reservoir of sealant.  the connector is adapted for operation  by a hand tool which rotates the third housing part (13)  relative to the first housing part (11) to drive wires inserted  in the passageways (23, 33) into the slots.
