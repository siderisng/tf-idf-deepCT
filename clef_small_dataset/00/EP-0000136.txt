<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring the toner concentration of a developer mixture.A component (5; 21) carries at least one board-shaped coil (6) and a number of board-shaped coils (6.6 ', 6 ",.,) Whose all the conductor tracks (22) are in a plane.The coil or the coils of the component form the inductance of a measuring oscillator (34) and are arranged in the developing mixture current, which rims from the photoconductive surface of a drum (2) on which a latent charge image is developed with the developer mixture in a powder image.The conductors of the coils are rectangular or spirally arranged and can be cast with an electrically insulating, transparent material (27).The coils are further connected in a matrix (41) electrically and arranged on both sides of a strip (39) attached to the component (21).
