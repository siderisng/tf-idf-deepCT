<ABSTRACT>
In a method for connecting a first integrated circuit device with a number of connection punkers with a second integrated circuit device, a plurality of copper pins on a chip carrier (11) is formed by plating, in a pattern which use with the buffers serving as electrical connection points (25) a chip (23) matches.On the buffer (25) a small amount of solder is applied.The chip carrier (11) and the chip (23) are aligned against each other so that the copper pins (19) are aligned with the associated buffers (25).Finally, a pressure and a temperature is exerted on the chip carrier (11) and the chip (23) that each of the copper pins (19) with the.assigned buffer (25) one connection is received.
