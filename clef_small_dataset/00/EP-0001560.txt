<ABSTRACT>
novel polysubstituted 1,5-diazacycloalkanes and  polysubstituted 2-keto-1,5- diazcycloalkanes are powerful  stabilizers for materials subject to ultraviolet (uv) light degradation,  particularly for polyolefins.  the cyclic compounds of  this invention have (a) a fixed three-carbon bridge between  the n¹ and n⁵ atoms of the diaza ring, the remaining portion of  the ring having a variable length bridge of two or more carbon  atoms, (b) an n-adjacent carbon atom of the diaza ring is  polysubstituted, that is, has two substituents which may be  cyclizable.  compositions containing (a) the polysubstituted 1,5-diazacycloalkanes  and polysubstituted 2-keto-1,5- diazacycloalkanes  of this invention, and (b) prior art polysubstituted  1,5-diazacycloalkanes and polysubstituted 2-keto-1,5-diazacycloalkanes,  exhibit excellent stability to uv light.  a novel synthesis for preparing polysubstituted 2-keto-1,5- diazacycloalkanes is disclosed.
