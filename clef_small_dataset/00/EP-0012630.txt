<ABSTRACT>
a process is provided for producing a cellulose acetate-­ type permselective membrane which comprises casting a  dope comprising (a) 1 part by weight of cellulose acetate,  and (b) 2 to 20 parts by weight of a mixed solvent composed  of (i) dimethylsulfoxide and (ii) at least one water-soluble or­ ganic compound selected from monohydric alcohols having 2  to 5 carbon atoms, dihydric alcohols of the formula ho-­ (-ro-)h wherein r is an alkylene group having 2 or 3 car­ bon atoms and n is an integer of 1 to 16, and carboxylic acids  having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, the weight ratio of said water-sol­ uble organic compound to dimethylsulfoxide being not more  than 1:1; and solidifying the resulting raw membrane with a  coagulating agent.  the resulting permselective membrane  has very high water-permeability and protein retention and is  particularly suitable for use as a hemofilter in artificial kid­ neys.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "process for producing a cellulose acetate-type permselective membrane, permselective membrane thus produced, and use of such membrane in artificial kidney" this invention relates to the production of cellulose acetate-type permselective membranes, and more specifically to a process for producing a permselective membrane comprising a base of cellulose acetate and having very high water-permeability and proteinretention which is particularly suitable as hemofilters for artificial kidneys. some permselective membranes comprising a base of cellulose acetate have been suggested in the past. the mest typical example is a cellulose acetate permselective membrane called to loeb-type membrane disclosed in u. s. patents 3,133,132 and 3,133,137. the loeb-type permselective membrane was developed in order to separate water from saline solutions. it is produced by dissolving a film-forming cellulose acetate and an aqueous solution of perchloric acid in an organic solvent, casting the solution to form a membrane having a substantially uniform thickness, evaporating a part of the solvent for a certain period of time, and then chipping the cast membrane in water to remove the perchlorate salt. as an improvement of the loeb-type membrane, manjikian et al. added a water-soluble additive compound such as urea, glyoxal, h2o2, dimethylformamide (dnf), dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and acetic acid to a cellulose acetate casting solution, and examined the effect of the additive compounds on the properties of the resulting membrane. (proc. first international symp. on water desalination washington d. c. (pub. u. s. dept. interior, 0. 5. w.) 2, 159 (1965)). the loeb-type and manjikian-type membranes are reverse osmosis membranes for the separation of water from saline solutions. they have a salt rejection of about 90%, but their water ultrafiltration rate (to be sometimes abbreviated "ufr") is at most 2 ml/m2 hr mmeg. accordingly, these types of membranes cannot be applied to hemofilters for artificial kidneys which are the main use contemplated by the present invention. various permselective membranes of varying water ufr and/or varying retentions of solutes have been suggested recently by modifying the composition of a cellulose ester-containing film-forming dope. for example, 3. kunst et al. disclosed in journal of applied polymer science, 18, 8423 (1974) membranes having a water ufr of 10 to 60 ml/m2.hr.mmt3g and a sodium chloride retention of 0 to 5i. u. s. patent no. 3,494,780 discloses a process for producing a permselective membrane which comprises incorporating a polyhydric alcohol which is a non-plasticizer for a cellulose ester in a plasticized cellulose ester, melting the mixture and forming it into a film, and leaching the resulting film with a solvent which is a nonsolvent for the ester and is capable of dissolving the plasticizer and the polyhydric alcohol, thereby to remove the plasticizer and the polyhydric alcohol. it is shown in the patent that the water-permeability of the resulting film is 5 to 8 times as high as that of a commercially available regenerated cellulose dialysis tube (water ufr=l.5 - 2 mlxm2 hr mmhg). u. s. patent 4,147,622 discloses a process for producing an asymmetric permselective cellulose acetate membrane having a skin layer
