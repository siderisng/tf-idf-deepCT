<ABSTRACT>
1.  a device for fixing a cladding at a spacing from a wall, the cladding comprising a plurality of panels (5) which are each fixed to the wall (p) at a plurality of points, the panels (5) for that purpose being provided on their face which is intended to be disposed facing the wall, with fixing lugs (37) arranged to co-operate with at least one horizontally extending shaped member (50), the shaped member (50) itself being supported by brackets (10) anchored in the wall (p), by means of a slide member (16) mounted displaceably on each bracket (10) for adjusting the position of the shaped member (50) with respect to the wall (p), the device being characterized in that the shaped member (50) is tubular and that, on the outside, on respective sides of an axis (x-x) of symmetry, it comprises two upper grooves (53, 54) and two lower grooves (55, 56) the upper grooves (53, 54) being intended to receive a first stirrup-like member (30) associated with each fixing lug (37) which is fixed with respect to the panels, while the lower grooves (55, 56) are intended to co-operate with a second stirrup-like member (21, 22) formed on the slide member (16).
