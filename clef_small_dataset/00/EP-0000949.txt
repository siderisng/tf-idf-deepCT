<ABSTRACT>
cardiac and vascular prostheses and methods of making  the same.  the prostheses are suitable for implantation  in a bloody environment.  the prosthesis includes a surface  material adapted for exhibiting a regular and periodic surface  charge characteristic in the bloody environment (see  fig.  1a: scanning electron micrographs of an albumin  dacron hybrid graft).  a prothesis means supports the surface  material and is adapted to perform a prosthetic function  in the bloody environment.  in cases where cross-linking  is desired and the surface material cannot cross-link  with the substrate material, an adaptive material is  provided which cross-links both to the surface material  and to the material of the prothesis.
