<ABSTRACT>
a foam extrusion apparatus and method employs an  extruder (37,38) on an upper level extruding foamable extru­ date into the upper end of a large elongated barometric leg  (32) which extends at a relatively shallow angle into a pool of  water (29) at a lower level.  a conveyor (43) in the barometric  leg extends through a large radius in the pool (29) to guide the  extrudate from the pool (29) for further processing.  the leg  (32) is in the form of an elongated pipeline fabricated from  sections and supported on an inclined ramp (22).  some of the  sections are securely anchored to the ramp (22) to resist axial  forces when the leg is evacuated.  the sections may be rein­ forced concrete or fabricated reinforced steel of a variety of  sectional shapes.  each section is sealed end-to-end so that a  vacuum within the leg (32) will draw water from the pool (29)  into the leg (32) leaving a vacuum chamber at the upper end of  the leg in which the extrudate expands.  the leg may be pro­ vided with a number of windows for visual access and the two  levels may be the floors (20,21) of two horizontally and verti­ cally separated plants.  the lower end of the leg may be pro­ vided with a baffle where it enters the pool (29).
