<ABSTRACT>
agrochemical formulations, especially herbicidal for­ mulations, comprising water-in-oil emulsions of mean parti­ cle size below 10 microns wherein the oil phase is from 50  to 99% by weight, the aqueous phase being from 1 to 50% by  weight and containing 1 to 25% by weight of a water-soluble  agrochemical, especially a herbicide, the oil phase having  a resistivity at 20°c in the range 10⁶ to 10¹⁰ ohm cm, and  a viscosity at 20°c in the range 1 to 50 centistokes

<DESCRIPTION>
agrochemical formulations this invention relates to agrochemical formulations, and more particularly to herbicidal formulations containing water-soluble herbicides, including, for example the bipyridylium herbicides paraquat and diquat and the herbicide glyphosate. by the term "agrochemical" is intended a chemical useful in agriculture, for example a pesticidal substance such as a herbicide, insecticide, fungicide, bactericide or the like; or a plant growth regulating chemical; or a nutrient substance, or the like. the invention is particularly useful for certain herbicidal formulations. increasing use is being made in agriculture of the known ulv (ultra-low volume) spraying technique. this method uses relatively concentrated liquid formulations, containing e.g. 1 to 50% by weight of active ingredient, and a correspondingly low rate of application of the formulation per hectare, e.g. 1 to 25 litres per hectare, in contrast with more usual high volume spray rates of 200-500 litres per hectare, or more. with such relatively concentrated solutions, it is important to ensure that as much as possible of the formulation goes and stays where it is needed, i.e. on the plants being sprayed, and as little as possible is misdirected on to the ground or carried away by the wind. for this purpose, it is useful to apply electrostatically charged sprays. these are attracted to the foliage of plants; electrostatic forces carry them to the underside of leaves as well as to the top surfaces, and even coating is promoted. hitherto electrostatic spraying of pesticides has not been widely adopted, for lack of convenient, reliable and cheap spraying apparatus. a suitable apparatus is however now available, and is described in u.k. patent application 29539/76 (u.s. serial no. 812440). however, this apparatus tends to give inferior results when used to spray aqueous solutions. the present invention provides a class of compositions comprising water-soluble agrochemicals, especially herbicides, particularly suited to low volume electrostatic spraying, in particular by the apparatus described in u.k. patent application 29539/76 (u.s. serial 812440). according to the present invention we provide an electrostatically sprayable ready-for-use formulation comprising a water-in-oil emulsion comprising finely divided droplets of mean diameter below 10 microns of an aqueous phase suspended in an oil phase, the oil phase comprising from 50 to 99%, preferably 80 to 99%, by weight of the composition and the aqueous phase comprising from 1 to 50%, preferably 1 to 20%, by weight of the composition and having dissolved in it a watersoluble agrochemical comprising from 1 to 25%, preferably 1 to 10%, by weight of the composition, the formulation having a resistivity at 200c in the range 1 x 106 to 1 x 1010 ohm centimetre and a viscosity at 20 0c of 1 to 50 centistokes and being stabilised by from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the composition of an emulsifier. we find that emulsions according to the invention are readily sprayed at satisfactory rates using the apparatus of u.k. patent application no 29539/76 (u.s. serial 812440) and will give a range of mean spray droplet sizes of from about 30 to about 200

1. an electrostatically sprayable ready-for-use formu    lation comprising a water-in-oil emulsion comprising  finely divided droplets of mean diameter below  10 microns of an aqueous phase suspended in an oil  phase, the oil phase comprising from 50 to 99% by  weight of the composition and the aqueous phase  comprising from 1 to 50% by weight of the composition,  and having dissolved in it a water-soluble agro  chemical comprising from 1 to 25% by weight of the  composition, the formulation having a resistivity at  200c in the range 1 x 106 to 1 x 1010 ohm centi  metres and a viscosity at   20 0c    of 1 to 50 centi  stokes, and being stabilised by from 0.1 to 10% by  weight of the composition of an emulsifier.   2. a formulation as claimed in claim 1 in which the  agrochemical is a herbicide.   3. a formulation as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2  in which the oil phase comprises from 80 to 99% by  weight of the composition, the aqueous phase comprises  from 1 to 20% by weight of the composition and the  agrochemical comprises from 1 to 10% by weight of  the composition.    4. a formulation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 in  which the resistivity of the formulation is in the  range 107 to   109    ohm centimetres.      5.    a formulation as claimed in any of the preceding  claims in which the viscosity at   20 0c    of the  formulation is in the range 5-30 centistokes.   6. a formulation as claimed in any of the preceding    claims in which the agrochemical is a bipyridylium  herbicide, e.g. paraquat.   7. a formulation according to claim 1 substantially as  herein described with reference to any of the examples.
