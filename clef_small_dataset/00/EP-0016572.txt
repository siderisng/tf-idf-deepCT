<ABSTRACT>
a system of bypass passages (58, 60, 62) adjacent bearing  means (20, 22, 24) in the drive system of an ultracentrifuge  which operates in a vacuum environment.  the bypass pas­ sages (58, 60, 62) or channels are designed to prevent the  establishment of a pressure differential across the bearings  (20, 22, 24) in the drive system when a vacuum is being pulled  or exists around the drive system when it is operating.  the  unique bypass system prevents the loss of lubricating mater­ ial within the drive system during air evacuation of the drive  system and the rotor chamber when a vacuum environment is  being established within the rotor chamber.  also, the bypass  system promotes a more uniform and constant flow of lub­ ricating medium in the bearings.
