<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and a method for generating doped semiconductor layers on a substrate (10) by applying ions of the semiconductor material and the dopant. The device includes ion sources (12, 13, 14), means (16) for accelerating the ions, means for separating unwanted ions and to direct ion beams originating from two sources (12, 13 and 14) at the same time to the same area of ​​the substrate surface and means (23, 24 and 25) for braking the ions. Either a mass separator for each ion beam or a single mass separator (18), which brings the ion beams from two sources to a coaxial web profile, is used as a means separating for each ion beam or a single mass separator (18). The layers grown by this device become single crystalline only by a heat treatment at temperatures between 550 and 900 ° C. With the method, thin epitaxial seals can be produced with precisely fixed, vertical dopant distribution. Combined with the photoresist "lift-off" method, epitaxial scales can be selectively grown on a substrate (10) with the method of epitaxial screens.
