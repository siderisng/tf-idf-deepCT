<ABSTRACT>
A cylindrical foil sliding bearing, in particular for rotary pumps, as used in the chemical industry (stuffed tube pumps, PUM penydium-lubricated gap tube pumps), has between a cylindrical rotatable bearing pin or a shaft (1) and a uniaxial cylindrical or slightly conical bearing housing (2) at its outer circumference, a plurality of sliding foil portions (4) made of plastic, in particular silicone plastic or polytetrafluoroethylene, which each in the direction of rotation on the front end (11) formed axial slots (5) which are not ranging to the edges of the bearing sleeve (3), which are not formed in the bearing sleeve. Behalten are. Between the rear end (12) and the relevant end (11) adjacent film portions (4) there is a deh tion gap. The rear end (12) of each slide section (4) is free on the lateral surface of the bearing bush (3). Between the resting film portions (4) and Oer bearing surface of the bearing housing (2), a radial progress gamole (14) is provided from about 0.3 to 1 mm. To achieve the centrifugal force of the rear ends (12) of the filmab cuts, these can be complained there by an axis parallel rod (16).
