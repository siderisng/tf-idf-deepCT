<ABSTRACT>
blast furnaces for reducing iron ores show pronounced subsidence of coke and ore layers in an annular zone above the tuyère hollows, while the subsidence in the central and edge zones is minimal.  in contrast, the gases rise preferentially through the central and edge zones.  their specific quantity is much increased in these zones, but much lower within the annular zone.  this retards the reduction in the annular zone, which consequently takes place to any extent only near the tuyère level, necessitating an increased coke and air consumption.  by charging the central and edge zones with coke and ore of smaller particle size compared with the annular zone and with a coke input of from 100 to 200 kg per t of crude iron the flow of the gases and the reduction are substantially balanced out in the 3 zones.  the result is a coke saving of 5-10% and a corresponding saving in air, amounting to increased productivity.
