<ABSTRACT>
Particularly for washing machine doors, a locking device is provided with a plunger (12) and an electromagnet displaceable between two end positions, whose armature (7) via a bistable switching device (8, 9, 11a, 11b) is positively connected to the plunger (12). The bistable switching device has a displaceable in the direction of movement of the armature (7) slidable slide (8) and a connected to the plunger (12) perpendicular to the slide movable extension (14). Here, either on the extension (14) is formed for the slide (8) toward the stop surface (15a, 15b, 16a, 16b) and between the slide (8) and the extension (14) a the plunger (12) in the respective End position securing compression spring (9), or between the slide (8 ') and the extension (14'), a pivotable switching part (22) is arranged, which partially surrounds a pins (11b ') protruding from the extension (14') and which carries the stop surface (15a ', 15b', 16a ', 16b') aligned with the slide (8 '), and between the switching part (22) and the slider (8') is a switching part (22) and thus the Plunger (12) in one of the end positions support spring (9 ') arranged. Furthermore, the slider (8 ') carries a flexible flag (13) from compressed plastic, which extends to the vicinity of either on the extension or on the switching part stop surface.
