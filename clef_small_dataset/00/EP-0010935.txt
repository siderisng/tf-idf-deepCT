<ABSTRACT>
control apparatus for a drive transmission of a low  speed vehicle such as the hydraulic drive transmission of a  fork lift truck is provided in which an electrical signal is  developed having a frequency representative of the rate of  rotation of the drive shaft of the transmission.  in order to  provide control at very low speeds, instead of utilizing  streams of pulses to control changes of gear, the times  between successive pulses are sensed.  a first switching  circuit (scr1, d5, d6, rl1) remains in one state during  each cycle of the said signal which is less than a prede­ termined duration, and can be set in another state thereof  by actuation of a manually operable direction switch (65),  serving as a forward-reverse drive selector, when the du­ ration is greater than the said predetermined duration.  the  direction switch (65) is settable to select an electrical ac­ tuator (fwd) for forward drive and settable to select an  electrical actuator (rev) for reverse drive.  the first switch­ ing circuit (scr1, d5, d6, rl2) is such that the said other  state thereof enables setting of the direction switch (65) to  effect energization of the electrical actuator (fwd or rev)  selected by the setting of the direction switch (65).  a se­ cond switching circuit (rl2) is set one state thereof when­ ever the duration of a cycle of the said signal falls below a  second predetermined duration, and sets in another state  thereof when the duration increases to exceed a third pre­ determined duration.  the second switching circuit (rl2) ef­ fects energisation of a low gear ratio electrical actuator  (lo) or a high gear ratio electrical actuator (hi) respec­ tively depending upon which one of the said two states of  the second switching means (rl2) prevails.  the said second and third durations differ from one  another so that each change from energization of the low  gear actuator to energization of the high gear actuator ta­ kes place when the said signal represents a higher rate of  rotation than it does when each change for energization of  the high gear actuator to energization of the low gear  actuator takes place.
