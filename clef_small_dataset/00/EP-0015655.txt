<ABSTRACT>
a coating process in which an article to be coated is  immersed as an anode in a dispersion of a filmforming  material stabilised by non-ionic stabilisation and an elec­ tric current is passed between the anode and another elec­ trode immersed in the dispersion.  the dispersion is desta­ bilised in the region of and is deposited on the anode  by interaction between a moiety providing the non-ionic  stabilisation (e. g.  of polyethylene glycol) and a further  interactive moiety (e. g. carboxyl groups present in poly­ methacrylic acid) present in the dispersion.  suitable coat­ ing compositions and coated articles are defined.
