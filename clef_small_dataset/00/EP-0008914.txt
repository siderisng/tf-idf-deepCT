<ABSTRACT>
a method for effecting saccharification of raw cellulosic  material taken from any available source.  the cellulosic mat足 erial is hydrolyzed by immersing it in a bath of anhydrous  liquid hydrogen chloride to yield usuable glucose and other  products.  the cellulosic material may be processed through  one or more pre-treatment steps.  each acting to enhance the  yield of glucose and other products when the pre-treated  material is subjected to hydrolyzation by anhydrous liquid  hydrogen chloride.  the raw material may first be immersed  in a catistic solution which swells the cellular structure to  render it more reactive and acts to solubilize the lignins and  other compounds contained therein, these being washed  away to provide a prepared cellulosic material.  in another or  second preparatory step, the material may be further pre足 pared by subjecting it to a viscose process to produce a visc足 ous solution of sodium cellulose xanthate in sodium hydrox足 ide, from which solution the aqueous phase is separated,  leaving a viscose intermediate.  in the final step, the viscose  intermediate is hydrolyzed by immersing it in a bath of  anhydrous liquid hydrogen chloride.
