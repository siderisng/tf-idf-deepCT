<ABSTRACT>
n-hydrazides of 2-benzothiazolinone have been found to  be effective in regulating the growth of leguminous plants.   these n-hydrazides are characterised by the formula    wherein r₁ is hydroxy lower alkyl or 2-benzothiazolyl; r₂ is  hydrogen; or r₁ and r₂ when taken together with the  adjacent nitrogen form a heterocyclic having up to six carbon  atoms, inclusive, and n is an integer from one to four.  this invention relates to these n-hydrazides and their  use in a method of regulating the growth of leguminous  plants as well as to plant growth regulant compositions  comprising these n-hydrazides.
