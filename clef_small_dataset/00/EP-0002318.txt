<ABSTRACT>
exogenic porcine interferon for administration in human  beings.  the porcine interferon shows antiviral protecting  activity on cultured human cells and is substantially free of  any immunoelectrophoresis bands which are not identical or  partially identical with bands in human leucocyte interferon  or human agammaserum.  a process for preparing the  porcine interferon by harvesting, isolating and, if desired,  priming porcine leucocytes, treating them with an interferon  inductor and incubating them and obtaining the interferon  formed, the process being characterized in using, as added  protein source in any of the said stages, a source which is  substantially free of immunoelectrophoresis band which are  not identical or partially identical with bands in human  agammaserum.
