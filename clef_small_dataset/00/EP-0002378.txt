<ABSTRACT>
a control unit for establishing a four-wire connection  between two terminals via a pair of telephone lines 21, 22,  comprises switching means 24 which are operable to  provide a connection to a pair of telephone lines 21, 22,  signalling means 10 connectible to said lines via said  switching means 24 to enable another control unit to be  signalled via a line, and line send and receive circuitry 28, 29  connected to the switching means.  the line send and receive  circuitry 28, 29 has an input for connection to the send  channel of a terminal and an output for connection to the  receive channel of the terminal.  a central control 82 controls  operation of the switching means 24 and line send and  receive circuitry 28, 29 to automatically establish a four-wire  connection and adjust parameters of the line send and  receive circuitry to compensate for loss on the telephone  line.
