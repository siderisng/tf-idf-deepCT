<ABSTRACT>
a positioning system for moving a member (10) between  positions in time optimal fashion employs concurrent  feedforward and feedback control.  the feedforward control  system (20) provides coarse control and the feedback control  system (21, 23, 24) provides fine control to correct for deviations  between the actual and a nominal system.  the feedback  loop may thus be of low bandwidth permitting desensitization  to high frequency disturbances or the employement  of inherently low bandwidth controlled variables the feedforward control function includes successive  portions of opposite polarity corresponding to acceleration  and decleration of the member and also includes a subtractive  velocity related component.  this function represents the  approximate input to an electromagnetic coil actuator (12) of  a nominal system required to move such a member between  positions in time optimal fashion.
