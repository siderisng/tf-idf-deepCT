<ABSTRACT>
remote control apparatus comprises a beam projector  (10) which is controlled to alternately transmit rectangular  cross-sectional beams (y, p) of electromagnetic radiation  substantially parallel to a projection axis.  the beams (y, p)  are respectively pulse modulated over a correspondingly  distinct pulse rate frequency range to supply yaw and pitch  information and are respectively scanned in a direction  correspondingly orthogonal to its cross-sectional length.  the  size format of the beam cross-sections and the angle of the  scan are controlled according to a predetermined time  variable function.  in a first time period, the largest cross-sectional  beams are alternately transmitted and the scan  angle is decreased as a function of time, so that a fixed area  of detectable information is available for detection with  respect to an imaginary orthogonal reference plane moving  along the projection axis at a rate corresponding to the  predetermined time variable function.  in subsequent time  periods proportionately smaller cross-sectional beams are  transmitted and the scan angle is continually controlled.  a first embodiment uses a single set of proportionately  different size formatted cross-sectional laser devices as a  source of radiation (2), a scanning mechanism (6, 7) and a  fixed focus optical system including a beam chopper (12),  mirrors (16, 20) and lenses (18, 22) to effect alternately  transmitted beams orthogonally oriented and scanned with  respect to each other.  the cross-section of the beams can be  altered by selectively energising one or other of the laser  devices.  a second embodiment employs two corresponding sets  of proportionately different size formatted cross-sectional  laser sources (a, b, c and a′, b′, c′), a scanning mechanism  (106, 107) and a non-chopping fixed focus optical system  including mirrors 116, 120 and lenses 118, 122 to effect  alternately transmitted beams of selectable cross-section,  orthogonally oriented and scanned with respect to each  other.
