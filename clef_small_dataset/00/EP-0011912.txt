<ABSTRACT>
an acoustic apparatus for ascertaining wind speed and  direction at various altitudes which uses back scattered  acoustic waves which are formed from acoustic pulses of  predetermined frequencies, are transmitted on at least two  planes and the frequency spectrum and power of back scatÂ­ tered signals are measured, the received signal is divided into  a number of discrete frequency channels and these divided  signals are used to provide a velocity indication at various  altitudes at sequential time intervals.
