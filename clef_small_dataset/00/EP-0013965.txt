<ABSTRACT>
1.  method of manufacturing round or profiled solid wooden profiles from natural wood boles, or from natural wood logs derived from branches, preferably having a diameter appropriate for small-sized timber, for poles and for wall structures, ceiling structures and supporting structures built in the log-cabin style, or un palisade style, this method comprising the following processing steps : the natural wood boles are cut to a starting longlength and are sorted according to diameter-groups, the further processing being carried out, in each case, solely in the same diameter-group ; a plurality of logs are joined together, at their respective end regions, by wedge-type finger-joining and glueing ; thereafter, the log is further processed and, in particular, profiling is carried out, to produce a final cross-sectional shape over the entire length of the logs which have been glued together, this profiling operation being carried out by shaping, characterized in that, after the cutting-to-length and sorting operations, at least one plane longitudinal cut (3) is made in each log (11), this cut being located outside the final profile, or forming part of the final profile, parallel to the central longitudinal axis (4) of the logs and at distance (5) from this axis, corresponding, at the maximum, to the distance between the central longitudinal axis (4) and a tangent drawn to that diameter (6) of the tree top-end (7) of the log which defines a solid cross-section, and in that the operation of glueing together the end-surfaces of the logs (11) is carried out with the longitudinal cuts (3) aligned in the same plane and positioned one beside another.
