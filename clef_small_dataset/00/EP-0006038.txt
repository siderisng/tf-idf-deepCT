<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for horizontally transporting a boat to a firm floor. This installation comprises on the one hand trolleys (41, 43, 31, 33, 51, 53) each with a hydraulic cylinder (42, 44, 32, 34, 52, 54) and rolling elements (311 , 312, 313, 314) and on the other hand of the parallel beams (3, 4, 5) supporting the boat 11 which is arranged so that its longitudinal axis (13) is perpendicular to these beams which each relax each on the cylinders of two trolleys on two parallel lanes, the cylinders (42, 44, 32, 34, 52, 54) forming at least three groups of cylinders connected hydraulically so that the resultants of these groups are localized to the vertices of A triangle, and it is characterized by the fact that it comprises at least three parallel lanes on which the trolleys supporting the support beams which are arranged to form at least two filled beam lines perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the boat.
