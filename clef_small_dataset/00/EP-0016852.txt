<ABSTRACT>
hydrocarbons of two to four carbon atoms are prepared  by an improved fischer-tropsch process, the improvement  comprising the use of a catalyst comprising:   (a) at least one material selected from the group consist­ ing of the sulfide, oxide or metal of mo, w, re, ru and pt;   (b) at least one material selected from the group consist­ ing of the hydroxide, oxide or salt of li, na, k, rb, cs, mg, ca,  sr, ba and th; and   (c) a support.  the catalyst demonstrates good c₂-c₄ selectivity, is re­ sistant to sulfur poisoning and is regenerable.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for producing c2 -c4 hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen this invention relates to an improved process for the production of hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. in one aspect, this invention relates to a catalyst for use in the process to produce hydrocarbons containing two to four carbon atoms. the art contains many examples of metals known to be useful in reacting carbon monoxide with hydrogen to produce a variety of compounds -- both hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. these metals include, among others, mo, w, th, ru, re, pt, ni, co, and fe. it is upon the last three of these metals that most commercial experience is based. in the fischer-tropsch synthesis, carbon monoxide and hydrogen are reacted over an iron, nickel or cobalt catalyst to produce saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds containing from about one to as many as one thousand carbon atoms. the hydrocarbons can be aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic. commercial utilization of this synthesis prior to 1950 was accomplished largely in germany and is summarized in storch, columbic, and anderson: the fischer-tropsch and related synthesis, john wiley and sons, new york 1951. the following references are illustrative of the prior art and are helpful to an understanding of applicant? 5 invention: schultz, john floyd, "nobel metals, molybdenum and tungsten in hydrocarbon synthesis", by j. f. schultz, f. s. carn, and r. b. anderson. (washington) west german patent no. 2,343,032 "process for controlling fischer-tropsch synthesis", inventor: dr. mark eberhard dry, priority date: september 5, 1972. u.s. patent 2,490,488 "hydrocarbon synthesis catalyst", december 6, 1949. as mentioned above, the most extensive commercialization of the fischer-tropsch synthesis has been with the use of either an iron, nickel or cobalt catalyst. such catalysts produce a mixture of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as oxygenated compounds, which for the most part contain more than four carbon atoms. the cracking of these compounds to produce ethylene and/or propylene is not very efficient. for this purpose the desired compounds are ethane, propane, and the various isomers of butane and butene t addition sulfur impurities such as hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, or any other sulfur compound deactivate iron and cobalt catalysts in concentrations as low as 0.1 ppm. schultz (cited above) has shown molybdenum to have some sulfur resistance. his work was directed toward the development of an efficient catalyst to produce methane from carbon monoxide and hydrogen and he was reasonably successful. however, methane is not the preferred feedstock for the production of ethylene and/or propylene. for the present purposes, the catalysts of iron and cobalt produce molecules containing too many carbon atoms, and the catalysts tested by schultz produce molecules containing too few carbon atoms. the present invention relates to a process which produces molecules containing a more desirable number of carbon atoms for use as ethylene cracker feed stocks. typical catalysts in use today for this reaction require lowering of the concentration of sulfur impurities to approximately 0.1 ppm. since it is expensive to
