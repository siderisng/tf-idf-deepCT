<ABSTRACT>
cable seals (40) of the type employed in sealed electrical  connectors are maintained in a predetermined orientation  throughout manufacture and handling of same whereby the  cable seals (40) may be presented in a usable form to automa足 tic assembly equipment for manufacture in cable lead termi足 nations employed in such connectors.  according to the  method of the invention, the cable seals (40) are integrally  molded in a belt (54) which provides a handleable product  with the seals being maintained by the belt in a predetermined  orientation.  the cable seals then are punched from the belt  (54) and simultaneously inserted into a carrier (62) for subse足 quent handling while still maintaining the cable seals orien足 tated for use such as in automatic assembly equipment.
