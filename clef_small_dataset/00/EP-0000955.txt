<ABSTRACT>
a method for effectively browning foods in a microwave  oven by controlling the humidity of the cooking environment.   humidity and temperature sensors are provided  to measure the relative humidity of the environment surrounding  a foodstuff to be browned as the food is cooked  by microwave energy.  the actual sensed conditions are  compared with a predetermined optimum relative humidity.   adjustments to the relative humidity are then made by  either increasing or decreasing the air exchange rate, or by  increasing or decreasing the amount of heat added to the  air exchanged, or both.
