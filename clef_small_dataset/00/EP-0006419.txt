<ABSTRACT>
signature verification and authentication systems are  disclosed which include documents each of which bears a  cryptographic representation of at least one property of a  signature of an authorized user thereof modified in accor­ dance with at least one of a set of indicia identifying the  document with its authorized user.  apparatus are disclosed  whereby said cryptographic representations can be decryp­ ted and authenticated, using said indicia as a key.  appara­ tus are disclosed for producing such cryptographic repre­ sentations on documents, which apparatus include crypto­ graphic means for producing cryptographic representations  of signatures and means for modifying the operation of  these cryptographic means in accordance with one or mo­ re of said indicia.  methods of signature verification and au­ thentication using documents bearing such cryptographic  representations are disclosed.  both passive systems (48)  in which the decrypting of said cryptographic re­ presentations is performed by eye with the help of passive  optical elements (50), and active systems (210)  in which electronic means are used for the de­ crypting of said cryptographic representations are disclo­ sed.
