<ABSTRACT>
groups (11-13) of one or more magnetic domain chips (5)  are mounted in an array on the circuitized surface (2) of a  common substrate (1).  a rectangular pattern of slots (14) is  provided in the substrate (1) around each group (11-13).  each  group is encompassed through the slots (14) by the turns of the  inner and outer orthogonal solenoids (15-20) of its own exclu­ sive rotational magnetic field drive system and by a permanent  magnet bias field closed structure (22-32).  each chip (5) has a  pattern of i/o pads (6) located on its under-surface (8).  these  pads (6) are bonded to a corresponding pattern of terminal pads  (7) which are part of the circuitized surface (2) of the substrate  (1).  the interconnecting signal lines (9) to the terminal pads (7)  of the substrate (1) pass through one or more of the four  intersection corners formed between the slots (14) of the rectan­ gular pattern.  preferably, the substrate (1) also accommodates  integrated circuit modules and/or other components (34-41)  mounted thereon which are associated with the drive, sense,  and other support circuitry for the magnetic domain chips (5).
