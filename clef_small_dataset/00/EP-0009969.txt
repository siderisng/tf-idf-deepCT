<ABSTRACT>
a drive system for the fan (16) of a refrigeration sys­ tem, which fan (16) moves air through or over the  evaporator (15) of the refrigeration system, said drive sys­ tem comprising a fluid driven motor (22) supplied with  fluid under pressure from fluid pressurizing means (28)  driven by an internal combustion engine (17) for driving  the compressor (14) of the refrigeration system, said fluid  driven motor (22) having an output shaft connected by  means (24) to the shaft of an electric motor (26) being  de-energized when the fluid driven motor (22) is operative  and energized when the fluid driven motor (22) is inopera­ tive.

<DESCRIPTION>
drive system for the fan of a refrigeration system this invention relates to a drive system for the fan of a refrigeration system used for refrigerating the interior of a vehicle body or container for transporting goods which have to be kept at a low temperature, a refrigeration system having a fan driven by a drive system according to the present invention, and a vehicle body or container provided with such a refrigeration system. a refrigeration system is known in which the compressor of the system can be driven by an internal combustion engine or by an electric motor which is energized when the internal combustion engine is inoperative. in the known system there is provided a fan for moving air through or across the evaporator of the system so that cold air is circulated through the vehicle body or container. in the known system the fan is drivingly connected to the shaft of the electric motor, which shaft is driven by the drive to the compressor when the compressor is driven by the internal combustion engine and by the electric motor when energized. the drive to the compressor is disengaged when the desired temperature is reached in the vehicle body or container, either by disengaging a clutch when the drive is from the internal combustion engine or by de-energizing the electric motor when the drive is from the electric motor. therefore the fan stops rotating whenever the drive to the compressor is cut-out. this is disadvantageous as the cold air is not then circulated in the vehicle body or container and the temperature therewithin will increase rapidly. when de-frosting the evaporator of the system the compressor is driven and therefore the fan is driven and shutters or the like have to be provided which are closed to prevent the fan discharging air through or over the evaporator. when such a system is used for refrigerating a vehicle body the internal combustion engine is used to drive the compressor during the period that the vehicle is operative. when the vehicle is inoperative, such as at night, the internal combustion engine is stopped and the electric motor is connected to a suitable source of electrical energy and used to drive the compressor. when the system is provided on a container, the internal combustion engine is used to drive the compressor during transportation of the container by rail or road and the electric motor is used to drive the compressor when the container is located near to a suitable source of electrical energy, such as when the container is being conveyed by ship. the present invention provides a drive system for the fan of a refrigeration system which will enable the fan to be stopped whilst the compressor is driven by the internal combustion engine or the electric motor thereby avoiding the need for shutters or the like and which is continued to be driven when the drive to the compressor is discontinued. according to the present invention there is provided a
