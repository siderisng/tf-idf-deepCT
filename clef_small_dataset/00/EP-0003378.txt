<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of partially esterized compounds of divalent metals Subversely reaction products of natural resin acids by reacting natural resin acids with unsaturated dicarboxylic acid units and further reaction with compounds of divalent metals and polyhydric alcohols under salt formation and partial esterification, characterized by the following process stages: a) reaction of natural resin acids at 120 to 250 째 C with 3 to 10 wt. % Units of an olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, b) Part neutralization of the product from a) within the same temperature range as under A) with 0.1 to 2.5 wt. -% of a calcium compound, c) partial esterification of the product from b) at 120 to 200 째 C with 10 to 16 wt. -% of a polyvalent alcohol, d) reacting the product from C) at 140 to 200 째 C with 5 to 15 wt. -% A phenol-alkylphenol mixed resols or with a phenolresol alkylphenolresol mixture, e) further implementation of the product of d) at 240 to 280 째 C with simultaneous completion of partial salt formation and partial esterification to acid number of 20 to 50, wherein The percentages in a) to d) are each related to natural resin acid, use of the products as binders for printing inks.
