<ABSTRACT>
a novel polysaccharide s-60 is disclosed composed of  principally carbohydrate, 10-15% protein, and 3-4. 5% acetyl  groups as the o-glycosidically linked ester.  the carbohydrate  portion contains âˆ¼12% uronic acid (based on wt.  gum) and  the neutral sugars rhamnose and glucose, the latter having  an approximate molar ratio of 1. 5 to 1.  this polysaccharide  is produced by an unnamed pseudomonas species, atcc  31461, in a suitable fermentation medium.  deacetylated poiysaccharide s-60 is also disclosed.  it  has valuable properties in both the clarified and non-clarified  form and is useful as an agar substitute or as a shapeable  room deodorant.

<DESCRIPTION>
polysaccharide s-60, bacterial ientation process for its preparation and method of preparating it this invention relates to polysaccharides, their production and compositions containing them. it is known that heteropolysaclarides can be produced by certain microorganisms. some of such heteropolys2ccllarides function as hydrophilic colloids and because of their viscosity and rheological properties have been used as thickening agents for aqueous systems. as with other fields of technology, research has continued with the objective of discovering new heteropolysaccharides having useful properties as thickening suspending andjor stabilizing agents. the novel heteropolysaccharide of the present invention is produced by the action of a specified bacterium on a selected carbon souce arid ferinentation medium ingredients under controlled conditions. the heteropo lysaccharide of this s invention is a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide containing primarily carbohydrate residues and a minor amount of protein. it is sometimes referred to as a "gum" but it is believed that the heteropolysaccharide terminology is more accurate and precise. in the following description of our invention, it will sometimes be referred to as heteropolysaccharide 60, or s-60. in accordance with the invention, the novel compound is prepared by fermentation of a suitable nutrient medium with a hitherto undescribed organism, based on extensive taxonomic studies, which is an unnamed pseudomonas species. an unrestricted permanent deposit of this organism was made with the american type culture collection on november 21, 1978 under accession no. atcc 31461. various classification keys for the genus pseudomonas and the culture description of pscudomonas species are found in the 7th editicn of berey's manual (breed et al., (1957) and the 8th edition of lergey's wjanual (doudoroff et al., (1974), as well as by other schools in various publications; faugh and gilardi, 1974, pseudomonas, manual of clinical microbiolorw, 2nd ed., lennette et al., eds., pp. 250-269. american society for microbiology, washington, d.c.; weaver et al., 1972, identification of unusual pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, e.o. king, center for disease control, atlanta; iizuka et al., 1963, attempt at grouping the genus pseudomonas, j. gen. appl. microbiology 9:73-82; and hendric et al., 1966, identification of certain pseudomonas species, identification methods for microbiologists, part a, gibbs et al., eds., pp. 1-7, academic press, new york. these keys and descriptions were searched for a pseudomonas species having morphological and cultural characteristics similar to those of atcc 31461. the following considerations make the assignment of a new pseudomonas species justified and necessary. description of the strain 1. characteristics of cell slorphology single cells, straight or often curved, generally 0.6-0.8 by 2.0-3.0 wm, often with tapered end. the older cultures become larger and longer (0.8-1.0 by 7 3am), misshaped cells and pleomorphism appear, especially on media with limited amount of carbohydrates. on the contrary, cells keep rather consistent rod shapes when grown on media with carbohydrates, but again, most cells become large and pleomorphism develops during prolonged incubation. gram-negative, non-capsulated, poly-b-hydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate granules are seen especially in cultures of nitrogen-deficient media. blotile by polar multitrichous flagellation; one to four flagella are inserted at the polar end and occasionally subpolar
