<ABSTRACT>
pneumatic tire sidewall compositions are disclosed com足 prising blends of a halobutyl rubber, a high unsaturation rub足 ber and an oil extended terpolymer of ethylene, propylene,  and a diene wherein the oil extended terpolymer contains  from between 25 to 150 phr of a paraffinic or naphthenic oil.   these triblends provide sidewalls of unexpectedly improved  flex resistance, even as compared to similar triblend composi足 tions in which similar amounts of oil are included, but in which  an oil extended terpolymer is not employed.  furthermore,  methods of preparing such compositions are also disclosed  comprising preparing an oil extended terpolymer, and then  blending that terpolymer with the halobutyl and high unsat足 uration rubbers.
