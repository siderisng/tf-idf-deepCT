<ABSTRACT>
a slurry reclamation system for use with a concrete  ready-mix plant which enables 100% reclamation of the  constituents of concrete mix returned to the plant site by  vehicles.  returned concrete mix is dumped into a slurry vessel  (27) of predetermined capacity to accommodate a propor­ tion, suitably a fifth to a half, of the total average volume of  water used to produce fresh concrete during predeter­ mined production period.  the specific gravity of the slurry in  the vessel is determined during the next succeeding produc­ tion period and slurry is withdrawn from the vessel for  admixture with fresh concrete mix at a rate selected in  accordance with the measured specific gravity so that  substantially all of the slurry is consumed within the next  succeeding production period.
