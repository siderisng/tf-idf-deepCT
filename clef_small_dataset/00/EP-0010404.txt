<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a sheet material dispensing apparatus  wherein the sheet (14) passes through a nip preferably formed  by a drive roller (18) and a pressure roller (16).  a gear segment  (36) is mounted for rotation about a first point (49), and a lever  (24) is mounted for rotation about a second point (34).  when  the lever (24) is rotated, a point (40) or surface on the lever (24)  slidingly contacts a point (42) or surface on the gear segment  (36) causing the gear segment (36) to rotate through a greater  angle than the lever (24).  the teeth of the gear segment are  operably engaged with gear means (56, 60) which causes  rotation of the drive roller (18).  in another aspect of the inven­ tion, the gear means for rotating the drive roller includes a  floating gear (56), mounted in a slot (58) that is aligned gener­ ally parallel to the teeth of the gear segment (36) and which  causes rotation of the drive roller (18) during one direction of  travel of the gear segment (36) and is disengaged from the  drive roller (18) during the other direction of travel of the lever  (24).  the invention also employs an overload mechanism (32)  which prevents excessive force from being applied to the  gears (36,56,60) in the event the dispenser becomes jammed.   the invention is especially useful for dispensing paper towels  from a cabinet.
