<ABSTRACT>
a sealless strap connection is provided between a first  and second overlapped length of strap (222,220) and com­ prisesan array of longitudinally spaced joints (30,32,34,36,38)  with each joint comprising lengthwise opposed protuber­ ances displaced from their respective planes of the overlap­ ped lengths of strap and interlocked with each other.  the  protuberances on the first length of strap (222) are longitudi­ nally spaced in a first and second group with the protuber­ ances of the first group (240,244,248,252) equally spaced from  each other and with the spacing of the adjacent protuberances  of the second group (256,260) progressively increased in the  direction away from the first group.  the protuberances on the  second length of strap (220) are longitudinally spaced in first  and second groups with the protuberances of the first group  (292,296,300,304) equally spaced from each other and with  the spacing of the adjacent protuberances of the second  group (284,288) progressively increasing in the direction  away from the first group.  the first (240,244,248,252) and  second group (256,260) of protuberances on the first length of  strap (222) are interlocked with the second (284,288) and first  (292,296,300,304) groups of protuberances, respectively, on  the second length (220) of strap whereby, when the connec­ tion is initially formed, the protuberances intermediate the  ends of the connection interlock before the protuberances  (256,260; 284,288) at the ends of the connection.
