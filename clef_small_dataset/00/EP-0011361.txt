<ABSTRACT>
a temperature responsive fluid control valve (10) with  sequential control functions, employing a pair of axially  aligned hollow elongate plungers (22, 70) and a pair of ball  valves each comprising a valve member (32, 90) and a valve  seat (34, 92).  one ball valve is straddled by the two plungers,  being biased onto its seat by the second plunger and mov­ able from its seat by the first plunger.  this ball valve controls  a first fluid path (42, 56) in response to a temperature sensi­ tive element (18″) acting on the first plunger.  the second ball  valve is operated sequentially after the first, via the second  plunger for control of a second fluid path (78, 86) in response  to the same temperature sensitive element.  the valve is suit­ able for use in regulating the temperature of an engine by  using the first fluid path to control a shutter (58) and the  second fluid path to control a fan (88) to control together the  flow of air past the engine radiator.
