<ABSTRACT>
connecting block for electrically interconnecting first  conductors with associated second conductors, in which  a first connector part of insulative material has individual  receiving and indexing means for the first conductors  and in which a second connector part for mating with the  first connector has a body member of insulative material  and a plurality of slotted beam contacts.  the specification discloses as second connector part  a one-piece body member (41) and contactholding means  (50).  the slotted beam contacts can be assembled easily in  cavities (42) in the body member (41) which being in one  piece has no join therein to rupture.  the holding means (50)  has projections (53, 54) which extend through apertures  (45) in the wall of the body member (41) to engage in a  slot (34) and an aperture (25) in the slotted beam contact,  so retaining the contact in the cavity (42).  the connecting  block may, for example, be used to provide interconnection  fields in telephone systems.
