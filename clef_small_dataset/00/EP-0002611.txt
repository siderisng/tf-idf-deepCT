<ABSTRACT>
a process for the separation of acrylic acid from an  aqueous mixture of acrylic acid and water, in which a group  iii a metal halide salt, (preferably aluminium chloride) is  added to the aqueous mixture in an amount sufficient to  form an organic phase containing acrylic acid and an  aqueous phase, and the organic phase is separated from the  aqueous phase.  the aqueous mixture of acrylic acid and water is  generally that obtained from the oxidation of propylene or  acrolein over an oxidation catalyst, and preferably contains  less than 1% by weight of acrolein.  the separation is  preferably carried out at a temperature of from 25째c to 75째c,  more preferably 25째c to 50째c.  a recovery of 95% of acrylic  acid with a purity of 99% can be obtained with a single stage  of preparation using an aluminium chloride salt.
