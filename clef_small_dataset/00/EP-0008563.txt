<ABSTRACT>
in loading gear for heavy pieces (10) of rock having three ropes (18, 20, 30) which come from a central eye (16) and have attachment devices at their free ends, one (30) of the three ropes (18, 20, 30) is at least approximately twice as long as the two other ropes (18, 20).  this one rope (30) is run over a rope pulley (28) attached to the central eye (16) and is provided at each of the two ends with an attachment device.  the load of a piece (10) of rock hanging on the loading gear is thereby distributed substantially uniformly over the three ropes.  each attachment device consists of a hook (36) having a leg (38) designed for inserting into a drill hole (42) in the piece (10) of rock to be loaded and of an eye (22, 24, 32, 34) which is fastened to the relevant rope end and into which one each of the hooks (36) can be put.
