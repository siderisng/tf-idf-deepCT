<ABSTRACT>
a process for treating zinc plant leach residues for the  recovery of the lead, silver, and tin value contained therein is  disclosed.  the process includes the treatment of the zinc plant  residue with concentrated sulphuric acid followed by water  leaching and other hydrommetallurgical steps to separately  recover the lead, silver and tin.

<DESCRIPTION>
treatment of zinc plant leach residues for recovery of the contained metal values 1. technical field this invention relates to a process for treaty. leach residues for the recovery of contained metal values, arc more particularly, is directed to a process for recovering, lead, silver and tin from zinc plant leach residues. 2. background of prior art an increased recovery of zinc in electrolytic zinc plant ic accomplished by a high acid leach process. this acid leach process is universally designed for the maximum extraction of zinc and as a consequence, elements such as copper, cadmium and iron are, to a large extent, simultaneously extracted. these each processes are not, however, designed to extract minor elements such as, silver, tin, germanium, selenium, etc. rasher they are designed to leave elements which are toxic to the electrowinning of zinc in the leach residues. these residues therefore contain not only minor elements of commercial value but valuable amounts of zinc, copper and cadmium which are not fully extracted. in the past the leach residues from zinc recovery plants have been shipped to independent smelters for recovery of the metal values contained therein. the cost of shipping the raw residue substantially detracts from the intrinsic value of t residue. the process of the present invention allows for =he recovery of the lead, silver and tin metals contained in the zic leach residue, as well as the zinc, cadmium and copper rteÂ¯ls which may be recycled to the zinc plant for further pressing. @. b@@@t @@@@@ry of invention the present invention relates to a method for the traction of lead, silver and tin from zinc dlant leac@ zsidues. in accordance with the present invention zinc plant each residues are first treated with concentrated sulphuric . id to convert the metal values contained therein to thel- wter-soluble sulphate forms. these sulphate forms are then -ater leached from the acid mixture resulting in the separ - ions of the insoluble fraction from the leach liquor the nsoluble component at this stage is an upgraded lead bear*- esidue which after separation from the leach solut on ; washed and the lead recovered by standard metallurgical prc durss. the leach solution is then treated with chlorlde @@@ t precipitate the silver. after the silver is removed by filtration the leac solution is treated with zinc calcine under acid conditions --- reduce the iron content to a level compatible for the removal of tin as metastannic acid, co-precipitated with the resid@@@ iron in solution as collector/carrier. the resulting iron precipitate is then treated with mild acid to increase the t@@ concentration. the leach solution, after removal of the iron-t@@ precipitate, is returned to the zinc plant where recovery of contained zinc, copper and cadmium is accomplished. accordingly, it is an object of the process or to present invention to recover lead, silver, and tin from z@ plant leach residues. another object of the process of the present vention is to provide for the recovery of additional zinc copper and

claims    1. a process for the recovery of lead, silver and tin from zinc plant leach residues, comprising the steps of:  a)   sulphating    the zinc plant leach residue to form a dry cake wherein the bulk of the metal values contained therein are in their sulphate form;  b) water leaching the silver and tin from the sulphated cake;  c) separating the insoluble lead residue from the water leach solution;  d) recovering the silver from the leach solution by precipitation;  e) treating the leach solution to reduce the iron content; and  f) recovering the tin contained in the residual leach solution by precipitation.    2. the process of claim 1 wherein the zinc plant leach residue is sulphated using a sulphuric acid solution having an acid concentration of from about 90% to about 100% by weight.    3. the process of claim 2 wherein the sulphation is conducted at a temperature of from about 1500c to about 4000c.   for a period of time ranging from 1/2 hour to about 24 hours.    4. the process of claim 2 wherein water leaching is conducted at about ambient temperature of about   1000c    for about   1/2 to    2 hours.    5. the process of claim 2 wherein water leaching is conducted at about 800c for about 1/2 hour to 1 hour    6. the process of claim 2 wherein the insoluble lead residue is separated from the water leach solution by filtration.    7. the process of claim 6 wherein the insoluble lead.   residue is washed until the   fe    concentration of the wash water is below 3 g/l, the sulfuric acid concentration is below 5 g/l and the water soluble zinc below   0.5%..       8. the process of claim 2 wherein the silver contained in the leach solution is recovered by precipitation using chloride ions.    9. the process of claim 8 wherein the chloride ion is introduced in the form of sodium chloride.    10. the process of claim 9 wherein sufficient sodium chloride is introduced to the leach solution to raise the chloride ion content to at least 200 ppm.    11. the process of claim 1 wherein the iron content of the leach solution is reduced by the addition of zinc calcine at a ph of about 1 to 2 and a temperature of about   90 c.    to about   95 0c.       12. the process of claim 1 wherein the iron content of the leach solution is reduced by the addition of soda ash (na2co3) at a ph of about 1 to 2 and a temperature of about 900c to about 950c.    13. the process of claim 2 wherein. the tin contained in the residual leach solution is   procipitatod    as   meta tanr:ic    acid at a ph of about 4.5 to 5.      14. the process of claim 2 wherein the tin is precipitating using zinc dust.    15. a process for the recovery of lead, silver and tin from zinc plant leach residue, comprising the steps of:  a) sulphating the zinc plant residue with sulphuric acid at a temperature of about   2o00c.    for about 16 hours to form a dry cake wherein the metal values contained therein are in their sulphate form;  b) water leaching the sulphate cake at about   booc    for approximately 1/2 to 1 hour;  c) separating the insoluble lead residue from the water leach solution by filtration;: :  d) increasing the chloride ion content of the leach solution using sodium chloride to about 200 ppm to precipitate the silver as silver chloride and separating said silver chloride from the leach solution by filtration;  e) reducing the iron content of the leach solution to about 2 g/l by the addition of zinc calcine at a ph of about 1.8 and a temperature of about 900c to about   950c;     f) recovering the tin contained in the residual leach solution by adjusting the ph of said solution to about 4.5 to 5 such that the tin is precipitated as metastannic acid.     16. the process of claim 15 wherein about   4.2    tons of sulphuric acid per ton or iron contained in the zinc plant leach residue is employed in the sulphation.      17. the process of claim 16 wherein the weight of water to weight of dry cake ratio employed in the water leaching is about 3:1.
