<ABSTRACT>
hypoglycemic phenylpropynylamino benzoic acids and the  pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, their use as serum  sugars lowering agents and hypoglycemic compositions useful  for the treatment of diabetes.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
hypoglycemic phenylpropynylamino benzoic acids, their salts and pharmaceutical compositions which contain said novel compounds. diabetes mellitus is a disease of mammals which is characterized by an intolerance to carbohydrates and an inadequate production and secretion of insulin by the s-cells in the islets of langerhans. the disease is often associated with vascular degeneration, especially atherosclerosis. hypoglycemic agents which are effective in lowering blood sugars may be used in the treatment of certain types of diabetes. u.s. patent 3,983,164 describes a group of benzoic acid derivatives which have demonstrated hypoglycemic activity. the present invention relates to novel phenylpropynylaminobenzoic acid compounds and the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof which have been found to be active as hypoglycemic agents. the present invention also relates to the use of these compounds in lowering blood sugar in a mammal and to hypoglycemic compositions comprising the active compound in combination with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier and other excipients. compounds falling within the scope of the present invention may be represented by the general formula emi1.1 wherein r independently and at each occurence represents halo, alkyl or alkoxy and n represents the integer 0, 1, or 2. as used herein the terms "alkyl" and "alkoxy" refer to a moiety having from one to three carbon atoms in a chain either branched or unbranched. the term halo refers to a halogen substitution on the phenyl ring selected from the group consisting of fluoro, chloro, bromo, and dodo, with fluoro and chloro being preferred. pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the phenylpropynylaminobenzoic acid compounds described herein are considered as being within the scope of the invention. pharmaceutically-acceptable salts refer to the acid addition salts of those bases which will form a salt with the carboxylic acid and which will not cause an adverse physiological effect when administered to an animal at dosages consistent with good pharmacological activity. suitable bases thus include, for example, the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate and the like, ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines and the like. also aluminum salts of the instant compounds may be obtained by treating the corresponding sodium salt with an appropriate aluminum complex such as, for example, aluminum chloride hexahydrate, and the like. the phenylpropynylaminobenzoic acids described above and their pharmaceutically-acceptable salts when used according to the method of the present invention show hypoglycemic activity in mammals, i.e. lower the level of sugar in the blood. the compounds of the present invention are therefore particularly suitable for use in the treatment of diabetes in mammals characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood. the compounds can be administered internally to the mammal either orally or parenterally by subcutaneous, intravenous, or intraperitoneal injection or by implantation or the like. oral administration is generally preferred. the effective hypoglycemic amount of the active compounds to be internally administered to a mammal, that is the amount which is effective to significantly lower the amount of sugar in the blood,
