<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for sealing and closing fire protection covers (63) for openings (69) in walls and ceilings connected by means of transport rails (12) by the hinged action of a disconnected section (13) of the transport rail (12) out of the path of motion of a sealing element (11) which in the case of a fire can be inserted, with the characteristics that - the disconnected section (13) of the transport rail (12) is, at least on one of its front sides, bevelled and is fixed on a bearing lever (17) with hinged connection whose axis or shaft (14) is at right angles to the direction of transport (70) and which is also able to be swivelled out around the centre of rotation (62) of the axis or shaft, - the first axis x-x which determines the position of the centre of rotation is at a distance (b) from the side of the transport mechanism which is turned away from the transport rail (12), - the second axis y-y which determines the position of the centre of rotation (62) is at a distance (a) from the particular side of the fire wall on which the fire protection cover (63) is mounted, in which case - the hinged action (15) of the disconnected section (13) occurs in both directions via a connection unit which is subject to restricted guidance and thus to regulated guidance, and which consists of a curved guidance element (32, 43, 65) fixed on the sealing element (11), a feed roller (29, 41) which runs along the guidance element, a driving lever (40, 66, 28) and in some case a pair of bevel wheels (67) which is connected to the shaft or axis (14) of the hinged section (13), or - the hinged action (15) of the disconnected section (13) occurs via a driving mechanism which is independent of the sealing element (11), such as a power storage element in the form of tension springs (22) or counter-weights (25), or movement elements in the form of an electrical lifting magnet, a pneumatic or hydraulic adjustable cylinder, a rotary magnet (27) rigidly connected to the axis or shaft (14) or connected by means of a coupling (38), or an electric motor (45) with a speed reduction gear attached to it (46).
