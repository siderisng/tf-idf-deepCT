<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an apparatus and method for  displaying information regarding ring spinning machines  (10) wherein at least one traveling unit (12), moving along a  path for traversing one or more ring spinning machines,  carries detectors for monitoring yarns normally being  formed by traversed machines, and a data system responds  to the detectors for determining the condition of the  traversed machines from the condition of the monitored  yarns.  in one embodiment, additional sensors (31, 35, 39) are  provided on each machine (10) for signalling operating  conditions.  a processor (41, 42, 44) operatively communicating  with the sensors (31, 35, 39) and responsive to signals  from the sensors determines the operating conditions of  respective ones of the machines and generates display  signals, and a visual display (crt) responsive to the display  signals presents a visual display of the determined condition  of the group of machines.  in particular, the visual display  includes numerical indicia for various time, speed, doffing  readiness, and time in doff conditions.
