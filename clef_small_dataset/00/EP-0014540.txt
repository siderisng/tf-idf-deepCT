<ABSTRACT>
the display comprises a cathode ray tube (1,8) which  emits at two or more wavelengths, a liquid crystal cell (6), a  neutral analyser (3) and two colour selective polarisers (4, 5).   the cell (6) is switched in synchronism with different images  supplied to the cathode ray tube so that the different images  are observed in the different colours simultaneously.  the cell  (6) is respectively switched on and off by application of  signals at a low frequency fl and a high frequency fh.  to avoid  a patchy appearance due to different parts of the liquid crystal  having different twists a gap is allowed between switching the  signals fl and fh so that the total shear of the liquid crystal may  be kept below a critical shear value.
