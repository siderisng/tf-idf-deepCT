<ABSTRACT>
a novel approach to providing paint films which have  satisfactory weathering resistance with good stripping  properties comprises employing a paint undercoat in which  the film-forming resin has an acid value of from 10 to 45 mg  koh/gm, and may be based on a copolymer of vinyl acetate  or an acrylic monomer with an unsaturated carboxylic acid.   paint films including such undercoat are readily stripped by  means of a paint stripper having a ph of from 8 to 14, which  may include an organic solvent and/or a thickener to assist  attack on the paint film.

<DESCRIPTION>
method cf applying and strippin paint this invention relates to a novel approach to the problem of stripping paint films from substrates. in painting substrate it is usual to apply first a primer, to seal the substrate end provide a key for subsequent coats; then an undercoat with good covering power, to hide marks on the substrate; and then one or more top coats, ta provide desired surface finish. it has been conventional to formulate the paint so that all these coats are as resistant as possible to peter ioration and weathering, in particular, it has been conventional to formulate pants with film-forming resins having an acid number as low as possible, since film- forming resins with high acid numbers are well known to be subject to weathering and attack by water. this approach to achieving weather resistance provides paint films which are difficult to strip from the substrate. paint stripping, though very extensively performed is tedious and time-consuming, and there is a need for paint films which can be more easily stripped than heretofore. tis invention is based on the discovery that an undercoat of the paint film can b formulated in such a wa-y that the filul re tains satisfactory properties of durability and weather resistance but can more readily be stripped from the substrata when required. the invention accordingly provides in one aspect & method which comprises the steps of: a) applying to a substrate a paint film including an undercoat and a top coat, wherein the film-forming resin of an undercoat has an acid value of from 10 to 45 mgkoh/gm, b) subsequently stripping the paint film from the substrate by applying a paint stripping medium com prising an alkaline material in an amount to provide a ph'of from 8 to 14. in another aspect, the invention provides a method of stripping a paint film comprising an undercoat and a top coat from a substrate by applying a paint stripping medium to the film, characterised in that the film-formnng resin of an undercoat of the paint film has an acid value of from 10 to 45 mg roh/gm, and that the paint stripping medium comprises an alkaline material in an amount to provide a ph of from 8 to 14. this invention makes use of the well know fact that resins of significant acid value are susceptible to attack by alkali, and are indeed normally swellable or soluble in aqueous alkali . the film-forming resin of the undercoat needs to have an acid value of at least 10 in order to be sufficiently susceptible to attack by alkali to improve stripping. film-forming resins with acid values above 45 are so susceptible to water that their weather resistance is materially im paired. as the acid value of the film-forming resin o$ the undercoat increases within the range 10 to 45, the weather-resistant properties of the paint film marginalwly deteriorate, while the ease of stripping the paint film using alkali increases. it is surprising that an acceptable compromise
