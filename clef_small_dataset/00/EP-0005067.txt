<ABSTRACT>
a process for producing a molybdate or tungstate activated oxide complex catalyst in which the elements of the catalyst are combined together in a precatalyst aqueous slurry, the slurry obtained is dried to form a precatalyst precipitate, and the precatalyst precipitate is then calcined to form the catalyst, characterised in that the key catalytic phase of the catalyst defined as a molybdate or tungstate of bi, te, sb, sn, cu or mixtures thereof is preformed prior to combining with the other elements of the catalyst,  provided that when one or more elements in the catalyst is supplied to the precatalyst aqueous slurry in the form of  (a) a source salt having a heat-decomposable cation or anion,  (b) an inorganic salt reaction product of the source salt,  or (c) an aqueous slurry of either (a) or (b) then the elements of the catalyst are combined so that the precatalyst precipitate contains a substantial amount of at least one of the heat-decomposable anions or cations.   <??>the catalysts produced by this process are useful in the oxidation and ammoxidation of olefins.
