<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a method of tempering of  glass sheets comprising heating each of a series of glass  sheets to an elevated temperature sufficient for tempering  and then subjecting each said hot glass sheet to flows of  cold tempering medium applied against the opposite major  surfaces thereof at a rate sufficiently high to chill the hot  glass sheet and impart at least a partial temper thereto  characterised in that said cold tempering medium is initialÂ­ ly applied in the form of a plurality of thin, discrete, laminar  streams against each of the opposite major surfaces of  said glass sheet for sufficient time to harden said major  surfaces but insufficient time to cause the sheet to flutter,  and then additional cold tempering medium is immediately  applied in a more diffuse pattern that provides a smoother  support bed for said glass sheets than said discrete streams  against said opposite major surfaces to provide the desired  degree of temper of said glass sheets.  it also includes apparatus for tempering hot glass  sheets.
