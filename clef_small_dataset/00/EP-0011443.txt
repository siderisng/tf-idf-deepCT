<ABSTRACT>
a semiconductor integrated circuit device has a thyristor  in a vertical configuration in a semiconductor monocrystal­ line region (1) in a dielectric isolated substrate.  this has a  high breakdown voltage and large current capacity and is  therefore used as a power element.  lower power elements  controlling the thyristor are formed laterally in monocrystal­ line islands (8,9,10) set in a polycrystalline region (12).  the  polycrystalline region (12) is separated from the islands  (8,9,10) by a dielectric film (16) and from the monocrystalline  region by a pn junction (18).  one end of the thyristor is con­ nected to a lead wire (6) through an aluminium electrode (3)  whilst the other end is connected to a stem (5) via solder (4)  and an aluminum electrode (2) which is separated from the  polycrystalline layer by a sio₂ film (14).  the resultant device  achieves a high density of integration and low power loss.   the device can form part of a transistor-transistor-logic cir­ cuit.
