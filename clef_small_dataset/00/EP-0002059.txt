<ABSTRACT>
electrical lead wire connection to a tape electrode is  disclosed.  such electrodes are used for transmitting electrical  signals through skin.  the tape electrode includes a  porous substrate material carrying a conductive layer comprised  of finely divided silver metal suspended in a "dry"  adhesive.  an electrical lead wire (20) is connected to the  conductive layer of the tape electrode by a flat cover member  (30) having the same conductive layer on both sides  thereof as is carried by the substrate of the tape electrode.   one of the conductive layers of the cover member secures  the lead wire to the conductive layer of the tape electrode.   the other conductive layer of the cover member intimately  contacts the skin along with the conductive layer of the tape  electrode to provide for good electrical contact therewith  when the tape electrode is applied thereto.  the adhesive is  normally "dry" and is activated at the time of application  by a suitable solvent.
