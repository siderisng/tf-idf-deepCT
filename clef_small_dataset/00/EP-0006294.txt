<ABSTRACT>
a process is described for the comminution of a solid  material in the presence of a saturated solution of the solid  in a liquid in which the solid has a solubility greater than  1%, and also in the presence of an additive dissolved in the  saturated solution which can at least partially inhibit reÂ­ growth at crystal surfaces of the solid material.  the process  is of particular interest for the comminution of water-soluble  salts in the presence of their saturated aqueous solutions  and may be employed to make, inter alia, improved slurry  explosives and fluid fertiliser compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
comminution process this invention relates to the comminution of a solid material in the presence of a saturated solution of the material in an inert liquid, in order to reduce the particle size of the solid material. it is, of course, already known to grind solid, usually crystalline, materials in order to reduce coarse fragments or particles thereof to a finer state of such division, typically to particles of 0.1 - 10 micron size range, and thereby increase the surface area of a given weight or volume of the material. such procedures may be carried out in the dry condition, but more commonly a wet grinding process is employed in which the solid material is treated in an apparatus such as a ball mill, a sand mill or a pebble mill in the presence of a suitable liquid. in the majority of cases, the liquid chosen is one which does not dissolve the solid to any significant extent. there are instances, however, where it is required to reduce the particle size of a solid material in the presence of a liquid in which the solid in question has a significant or substantial solubility (the proportion of solid to liquid being, of course, greater than is required merely to saturate the liquid with respect to it). in practice it is found that comminution of the solid under these circumstances leads to little or no useful reduction in the particle size. even if the alternative procedure is adopted of producing the required fine particles by some other method (e.g. dry grinding) and then introducing these fine particles into a saturated solution of the same solid in the relevant liquid, it is found that there is a progressive increase in the size of the particles as the result of a spontaneous crystal dissolution - recrystallisation process. we have now found that these difficulties may be minimised or overcome if the comminution of a solid material in a saturated solution of the material in a solvent liquid is carried out in the presence of certain additives. according to the present invention, there is provided a process wherein a solid material is comminuted in the presence of a saturated solution of the solid in a liquid in which the solid has a solubility greater than 1% by weight, and also in the presence of an additive which is at least partly dissolved in the said saturated solution and is capable of at least partially inhibiting re-growth at both existing crystal surfaces and new crystal surfaces produced by the comminution operation. the process may be applied to any solid material which can be comminuted or reduced in particle size by the use of grinding apparatus such as those referred to above and which is soluble in the liquid in the presence of which it is treated to the extent of more than 1% by weight. the difficulties which have been referred to above are in general apparent where the solubility of the solid material in the

we claim :   1. a process wherein a solid material is comminuted in the  presence of a saturated solution of the solid in a liquid  in which the solid has a solubility greater than 1% by  weight, and also in the presence of an additive which is  at least partly dissolved in the said saturated solution  and is capable of at least partially inhibiting   growth     at both existing crystal surfaces and new crystal  surfaces produced by the comminution process.   2. a process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a water-soluble  solid material is comminuted in the presence of its  saturated aqueous solution.   3. a process as claimed in claim 2, wherein   thewater-soluble     solid material is a salt selected from ammonium nitrate,  sodium nitrate, calcium nitrate, potassium chloride,  sodium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium poly  phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate and disodium  hydrogen phosphate.   4. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein  the additive is a polysaccharide.   5. a process as claimed in claim 4 when dependent upon claim  3, wherein the solid material is ammonium nitrate and the  additive is sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.   6. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein  the additive is a long chain aliphatic amine or a salt  thereof.   7. a process as claimed in claim 6 when dependent upon claim  3, wherein the solid material is essentially ammonium  nitrate and the additive is an aliphatic primary,  secondary or tertiary amine in which the aliphatic group  contains between 6 and 18 carbon atoms, or the acetate  or oleate of such an amine.     8. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein  the additive is a low molecular weight inorganic salt.    9. a process as claimed in claim 8 when dependent upon claim  3, wherein the solid material is potassium chloride  and/or sodium chloride and the additive is selected from  the ferrocyanides and ferricyanides of sodium or potassium,  borax, cadmium chloride and lead chloride.   10. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein  the amount of additive employed is at least 0.05% of the  total weight of solid material present in the composition  being comminuted, including that dissolved in the liquid.   11. a slurry explosive composition based essentially on  ammonium nitrate, whenever prepared by a process as claimed  in any one of claims 1 to 10.   12. a fluid fertiliser composition based essentially on  potassium chloride and an ammonium phosphate, whenever  prepared by a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to  10.
