<ABSTRACT>
When a load is disposed on the receiver tray (3), the index (4) moves in the slot (5) of the body (1), opposite a fixed graduation (6).On the front face it is provided a housing (7) closed on the front by a transparent wall (8) and also closed on its side (9).The opposite side (10) is open to allow insertion into the housing of a books (11) formed of a set of ladder sheets connected by a ring binding (12).The sheet chosen as the head sheet of this notebook has a special sp√© scale that is in the immediate vicinity of the slot (5) and is visible through the wall (8).The index (4) is moving opposite this scale.
