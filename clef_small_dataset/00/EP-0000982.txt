<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a motorised focusing system  with an electromagnetically actuated lens drive, for example  for use in a photographic camera having an automatic  rangefinder.  the lens (16) is adjusted axially by the rotation  of the lens holder (14) on a fixed support (40).  the  lens holder is rotated by an epicyclic motor having a stator  (46) concentric with the optical axis of the lens with poles  (48) which are energised sequentially to cause a hollow  armature (36) within the stator to roll eccentrically around  a fixed armature support (54).  armature teeth (70) engage  teeth (72) on the fixed armature support and armature  teeth (78) engage teeth (80) on the lens holder (14),  resulting in a speed reduction in the drive to the lens holder.   the lens moves incrementally in response to pulses  applied to the stator windings, a given number of pulses  representing a known amount of axial movement of the  lens.
