<ABSTRACT>
Microwaveline line, whose periodic geometric structure includes the repetition of a first and a second mesh (M₁, M₂).Chopsticks, dielectric material and good thermal conductor, are said parallel to the line (00 ') and regularly spread over its periphery.They are divided equally into a first and second groups (1, and 2), regularly distributed around the line.The chopsticks of the first group (1) are brazed on the first meshes (M₁) of the line, and isolated seconds, and the chopsticks of the second group (2) are brazed on the second meshes (m₂) of the line, and isolatedFirst.Application to progressive wave tubes operating in amplifiers.
