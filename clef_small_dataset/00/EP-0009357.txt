<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle braking system includes a pair of valve  devices (14, 15) which compensate for variations in wheel  load for each of the rear brakes.  the valve devices (14, 15)  are controlled by suspension travel through a resilient  linkage means, but because the suspension is stiffer in roll  than in bounce, the linkage is desirably more sensitive in  roll.  the resilient linkage includes a pair of torsion bars  (29, 31), each of which has a crank arm (32, 42) at one  end and a bearing support (34, 44) adjacent to the crank  arm (32, 42).  each crank arm (32, 42) is connected to a  respective suspension component (18, 19), the torsion  bars (29, 31) being arranged so that the reaction at the  bearing support (34, 44) provides the main control force  for the respective valve (14, 15) whilst the other end of the  torsion bar is connected to the other valve to provide a  compensating force which is subtractive in the bounce  mode but additive in the roll mode.
