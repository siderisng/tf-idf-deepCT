<ABSTRACT>
Substituted diaminophthalides which correspond to the formula wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are independently unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, hydroxyl, cyano or lower alkoxy alkyl with at most 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl, benzyl or by halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy substituted benzyl and R₁ is also hydrogenand R₃ can also be phenyl or R₁ and R₂ together with the nitrogen atom connecting them to a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic radical and the ring A is unsubstituted or substituted or has a condensed, unsubstituted or substituted benzene or heterocyclic ring.These compounds are particularly suitable as color formers in pressure or heat-sensitive recording materials.
