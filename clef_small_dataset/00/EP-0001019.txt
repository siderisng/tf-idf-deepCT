<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the general formula    wherein r¹, r², r³, r⁴ and r⁵ are each independently h,  cl, br, no₂ or cf₃; x = h or br; and z is h, ch₃ or cf₃.  the compounds are all potent inhibitors of oxidative  phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria and have other  biological activity, for example, insecticidal activity.  the compounds are made (a) where x = h and  z = cf₃, by reacting the appropriately substituted phenylhydrazine  with hexafluoroacetone in a basic organic solvent  in the presence of an acidic dehydrating agent;  (b) where x = h and z is h or ch₃ by reaction of the  phenylhydrazine with 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone or trifluoroacetaldehyde  in a suitable solvent in the presence of an  acid catalyst; (c) where x = br can be made from the  corresponding compound where x = h by direct bromination.  the invention includes insecticidal compositions containing  the compounds.
