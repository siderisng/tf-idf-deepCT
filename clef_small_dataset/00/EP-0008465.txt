<ABSTRACT>
1.  safety-valve for a steam pressure cooker, with a valve seat (8) in a valve housing (1), with one or more inflow passages (4c, 15, 1b) on one side and one or more outflow passages (1a, 9) on the other side of the valve seat (8), and with a valve body (4) adjustably spring-loaded in the direction towards the valve seat (8), which is raised from the valve seat (8) under the internal pressure after exceeding the spring loading (16), as well as with a throttle in the flow path of the valve, characterized in this that a throttle body (24) is arranged in the inlet passage (4c, 15, 1b) adjustable against a spring loading by the internal pressure in the direction of flow, which defines the throttle with the wall (4b) of the inlet flow passage (4c), the throttle body (24) and/or the wall (4b) having such a sharp that with increasing displacement of the throttle body (24) in the direction of flow the throttling action continuously increases and/or increases in steps.
