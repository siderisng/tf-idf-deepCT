<ABSTRACT>
ATMs. The device comprises: a leaves store; a rotary circular tray; a leaflet head rotatably mounted on said circular tray; and means for counting the number of towers made by the circular tray; Said leaflet head having a plug face that has perforations that can be connected to a depression source. The rotary plate (49) also carries several columns (57,58,59). A first safety device indicates whether the plug head (56) has, optionally, seized more than one sheet, and a second safety device controls if the socket head actually entered at least one sheet. The first safety device comprises a circular sector (98) pivoting on the plug head and whose radius is equal to the distance between its geometric axis and the cylindrical surface of the next column (57), increased by a value between The thickness of a single sheet to count and the sum of the thicknesses of two leaves. The invention is applicable to counting sheets, including bank notes.
