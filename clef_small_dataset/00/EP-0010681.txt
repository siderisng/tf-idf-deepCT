<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for cutting or shredding paper, cardboard, microfilms or the like, comprising a cutting device and a drive for the cutting device, characterised in that the driving element is in the form of an independent unit (1) adapted to be connected to a supporting structure (3) with waste bin (6) and comprising a driving motor (36), circuit control elements (14, 30) and driving pinions (12) driven by the driving motor (36), in that at least one cutting mechanism (8) having a particular width of cut, consisting of cutter blade rolls (45), driving gear wheel (11, 39) and stripper device (46) is provided as an independent unit which can be selectively suspended to the driving element (1) or exchanged, in that guide means (9, 15) and stop means (13, 22) are provided for an accurately predetermined connection between the driving element (1) and the cutting mechanism (8), the driving pinion (12) of the driving element (1) being in positive operative connection with the driving gear wheel (11) of the cutting mechanism (8) when the cutting mechanism is in the operative state.
