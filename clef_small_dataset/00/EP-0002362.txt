<ABSTRACT>
a vent for a devolatilizer includes a vent opening (20) in  the cage (10) of the devolatilizer and a vent duct (22) which  communicates with the vent opening.  vapour escapes into  the cylindrical vent chamber (24) in the vent duct.  the  chamber is cleaned by a vent screw which is rotated in the  chamber and includes a screw body (26) of minimal diameter  and a helical screw flight portion (28) of a pitch which is  sufficiently large such that the velocity of the vapour leaving  the cage through the vent duct is maintained below a  predetermined maximum vapour velocity.  this maximum  vapour velocity is set such that the amount of fine material  which is entrained in the escaping vapour is minimized.  a  vapour outlet (48) is connected to the vent chamber for  extracting vapour from the chamber so that it may be  recycled or disposed of.
