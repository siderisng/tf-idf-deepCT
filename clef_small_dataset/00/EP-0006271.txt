<ABSTRACT>
textile softening detergent compositions comprise a  nonionic detergent, a cationic textile softener, builders and  a nononic-type optical brightener, selected from benz­ oxazole, coumarin, bis(benzimidazolyl) furan and bis­ (sulphonamidostyryl)biphenyl types.  preferred composi­ tions also contain a discolouration inhibitor, and are made  by spraying a mixture of the nonionic detergent and cationic  softener on to spray dried granules comprising at least part  of the builders.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
washing and softening compositions containing nonionic brightener the present invention relates to detergent compositions which have very good cleaning properties and also have textile softening properties. for many years most heavy duty detergent compositions have been based upon anionic surfactants and they have been observed to cause some harshness in the feel of washed. fabrics. accordingly there have been developed textile softening compositions, and these have been based upon long chained cationic surfactants. as cationic and anionic surfactants are generally incompatible, these softening compositions have been intended for use in the final rinse of a washing process, that is after substantially all the anionic surfactant has been removed. clearly there is a need for a single composition able both to clean the fabrics and to soften them. attempts to incorporate cat ionic softeners in anionic based detergent compositions, overcoming their ordinary incompatibility, have been described in the art. another approach has been to use nonionic surfactants with cationic softeners in built detergent compositions, as described in bp 1,079,388, dtas 1,220,956, usp '3,537,993 and usp 3,607,763. however, products containing a high ratio of nonionic detergent to cationic softener are said to soften inadequately, whereas those with a high ratio of cationic to nonionic are said to clean inadequately. a particular problem in the use of such products has been the discolouration, usually yellowing, of repeatedly washed fabrics. this problem is believed to arise from three causes. the first is the ineffectiveness of most of the usual optical brighteners when applied in the presence of cationic surfactants due to the failure of the brightener to deposit upon fabrics in such surroundings and/or from an actual quenching of the fluorescence of the brightener in the presence of cationic surfactant. the second main cause of yellowing is build-up of the brightener itself, which in some circumstances can act as a dyestuff at visible wavelengths. the third cause is apparently an interaction between the cationic or nonioniccationic surfactants and colouring matter in the water used to make up the wash baths. the extent of this problem depends upon the state of the civic water supply, and can vary from.place to place and from time to time. iron content may be one relevant factor but probably organic e.g. peaty colouring matter is more usually the principal cause. it has been found that the yellowing problems associated with the use of cationic surfactants in textile softening detergent compositions can be largely overcome by selection of certain classes of nonionic brighteners. according to the invention there is provided a detergent composition which imparts a soft feel to fabrics washed therewith, which comprises: (a) from 10 to 30% by weight of one or more polyethoxy nonionic detergents having hydro philic-lipophilic balance in the range from 8 to 15 and having not more than an average of 16 ethoxy units per molecule (b) from 1 to 15% by weight of one or more cationic textile softeners; (c) from 0.001 to 3.08 by weight of a nonionic optical brightener selected from
