<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to a method of applying self-adhesive symbols in a desired pattern to a substrate, in which first the symbols are arranged in the desired pattern on a mounting sheet and subsequently picked up with the aid of a sticking strip applied across the symbols, the adhesion to the symbols being inferior to that between the symbols and the substrate, and stuck to the substrate, after which the sticking strip is removed. such a method is known from dutch patent specification 144.529. this known method operates satisfactorily in practice, especially for symbols of comparatively small size. when larger symbols are used a problem may be involved in that deformation of the symbols may occur when they are arranged on the mounting sheet. it may also be difficult to remove larger symbols arranged on a carrier sheet. during this treatment the symbol may be deformed and/or torn up. moreover in the case of large-size symbols it is difficult to obtain the typographically correct spacing between the symbols on the mounting sheet and hence subsequently on the substrate. the invention has for its object to provide a solution for these problems. according to the invention this is achieved in that each symbol is temporarily stuck to its own carrier, the carrier is stuck to the mounting sheet, whilst the adhesion between the carrier and the mounting sheet is superior to that between the symbol and the carrier. since each symbol is temporarily stuck to its own carrier, handling is considerably simplified. the symbol with its carrier is arranged on the mounting sheet so that it is possible to arrange the carriers with their symbols in the desired pattern without the symbol itself being touched. the carrier, which may be square or rectangular in shape, is of course insensitive to deformations during handling. after the symbols are removed from the carriers, the carriers remain on the mounting sheet. the adhesion between the mounting sheet and the carriers may be obtained by an adhesive layer on the mounting sheet or by an adhesive layer on the bottom side of the carrier. placing the carriers with the symbols on a straight line is considerably facilitated when the mounting sheet is provided with a stop strip for carriers. it is then only necessary to lie the carriers with one of their sides against a stop strip on the mounting sheet in order to obtain the symbols on a straight line. the arrangement is furthermore facilitated when the side of the mounting sheet facing the carriers has a colour different from that of the top side of the carrier. the contrast will contribute to a ready arrangement of the carriers in line. when for example letters are arranged, the distance between the letters has to be chosen in accordance with given typographical rules for the letters concerned. this is considerably simplified when the circumferential shapes of the carriers are chosen in accordance with the symbols carried thereby. in this method a mounting sheet may be
