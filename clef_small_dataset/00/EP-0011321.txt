<ABSTRACT>
3-azabicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexane -2,4-dione and substituted  analogues thereof can be prepared by reacting a compound of  the general formula ii or a halide, ester or anhydride thereof:-    in which each of r¹, r², r³ and r⁴ represents a hydrogen atom  or an optionally alkoxy-substituted alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl  or aralkyl group, with ammonia and optionally water, and  effecting cyclisation of the resultant intermediate product by  heating.  most of the compounds prepared are novel.

<DESCRIPTION>
"pyrrolidine derivatives and process for the preparation of such compounds" this invention relates to a process for the preparation of certain pyrrolidine derivatives which are useful intermediates in the preparation of biologically active molecules. most of the compounds are novel. certain derivatives of 2-carboxy-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane have useful plant growth regulating activity, being capable of sterilizing the male anthers of plants. the 3-azabicyclo 3.1.0]hexane ring system is however very difficult to synthesise. a method has now been found for the preparation of certain pyrrolidine derivatives which may be used in the preparation of 2-carboxy-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane derivatives thereof. the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the general formula: emi1.1 r1 each of r1 r2 fizzand r4 wherein each of , r2, r3 and r4, any two or more of which may be the same ar different, represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group which may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more alkoxy groups; or r1 and r4 have the above meaning and r2 and r3 together represent an alkylene group; which comprises reacting a cyclopropane derivative which is a compound of the general formula: emi2.1 wherein r1, r2, r3 and r4 have the meanings given for the general formula i, or a mono- or di-acyl halide or a mono- or di-ester or the anhydride thereof, with ammonia and optionally water; and effecting cyclisation by subjecting the resultant product to elevated temperature suitable cyclopropane derivatlses to be used as starting materials for the process according to the invention include the free cos acid of formula ii and the anhydride thereof. if an acyl halide is used, this is preferably the di-acyl chloride if an ester is used, this is preferably a dialkyl ester, for example the dimethyl or diethyl ester in all cases, a cis-compound must be used, in order that cyclisation may be effected after the treatment with ammonia the most preferred cyclopropane derivative starting material is the anhydride of the acid of the formula ii. preferably each of r1, r2, r3 and r4 represents a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group having up to 6 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group having up to 10 carbon atoms; or r2 and r3 together form an alkylene group containing up to 6 methylene groups. more preferably each of r1, r , r3 and r represents a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group having up to 4 carbon atoms, for example a methyl group; or r2 and r3 together form an alkylene group containing 4 or 5 methylene groups. an especially preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is one in which 3-aza bicyclo05 l olhexane-2,4- dione of formula is prepared emi2.2 the cyclopropane derivative starting material may be reacted with gaseous ammonia, with liquid ammonia or with a solution of ammonia, for example an aqueous solution of ammonia if an aqueous solution is used, this is preferably a concentrated solution,
