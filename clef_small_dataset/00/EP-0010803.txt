<ABSTRACT>
aggregated coffee flake particles comprise a plurality  of compressed coffee flakes bonded together wherein at  least one of which is a low-moisture flake (1% to 3. 5% by  weight) and at least one of which is a high-moisture flake  (4. 5% to 7% by weight) are disclosed.  the composite flake  particles range in thickness from 9 to 16 mills.  the flaked  coffees provide improved extractability of the water-soluble  flavor constituents, exhibit high initial aroma levels, and  exhibit high bed permeability.  also disclosed is a process  for preparing aggregated mixed-moisture flaked coffee.   the process comprises:   (1) separately cold-grinding dual streams of roast  coffee, relatively high-moisture and low-moisture, respecÂ­ tively;   (2) combining of the two ground coffee streams to  provide a roll mill feed having a specified particle size  distribution and average moisture content, and   (3) passing the coffee feed through a roll mill under  specific conditions, and   (4) screening the roll-milled, aggregated flaked coffee  to produce a product such that no more than 60% by  weight passes through a 30-mesh u. s.  standard screen.
