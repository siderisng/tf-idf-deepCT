<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a carrier (74) for an apparatus  that must be moved to different positions relative to a work  station including a track (22) mounted to the work station and  a truck (24) assembly with a locking brake (36) riding the  track.  a mounting head which receives the apparatus is cou­ pled to the truck by an arm.  the mounting head (28) rotates  relative to the arm (26) and includes a locking brake to pre­ vent rotation.  a single control handle (20) simultaneously  releases the mounting head and truck assembly to permit  normal relocation and reorientation of the apparatus with  respect to the work station and for convenient access to the  apparatus.  releasing the control handle causes both locking  brakes to engage, thereby fixing the apparatus in the desired  position and orientation.
