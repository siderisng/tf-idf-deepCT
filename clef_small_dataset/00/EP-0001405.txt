<ABSTRACT>
in a device for covering liquid-filled basins, in particular swimming pools, a buoyant cover made of shutter-like interconnected individual parts and spreadable over the liquid can be coiled up to form a roll on a shaft arranged at a distance above the liquid level.  in this case, the shaft is mounted in the region of one edge of the pool, where it, and in the rolled-up condition also the winding of the cover, can get in the way, particularly in the case of large public swimming pools, which, for example for safety reasons or when holding swimming competitions, have to be accessible from all edges.  both in the case of existing swimming pools for retroactive installation and in the case of newly constructed pools, therefore, the covering device is arranged in a simple manner such that the roll (9) is rotatably mounted on pillars (4,5), the pillars being dimensioned in their height (25) so that the space between the pillars (4,5) under the roll (9) is freely accessible.  <image>
