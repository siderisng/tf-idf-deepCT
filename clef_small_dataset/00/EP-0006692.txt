<ABSTRACT>
novel streptomyces plasmids have the characteristic  that their presence in the non-integrated form in a micro-­ organism of the species streptomyces lividans confers on  that micro-organism the properties (a) of forming «pocks»  when grown on a «lawn» of that strain of micro-organism  deposited with the deutsche samlung von mikro-organis­ men (dsm) under the reference number 1567, and (b) of  not forming «pocks» when grown on a «lawn» of that  strain of micro-organism deposited with the dsm under the  reference number 1568, or which is derivable from a plas­ mid having such a characteristic by the removal or addi­ tion of dna therefrom.  the plasmids are prepared from micro-organism con­ taining them or by the manipulation of other plasmids of  the group and are of value as vectors for the introduction  of nucleic acid into micro-organisms.
