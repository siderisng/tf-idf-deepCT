<ABSTRACT>
a connecting device for interconnecting components  such as drawer wall panels at right angles to one another has  the respective projections (5,6) extend at right angles to one  panels to be interconnected, the respective projections (5,6)  which engage with the panels being carried on separate parts  of the connecting device which may be interengaged so that  the respective projections (5,6) extend at right angles to one  another.  in this way the connecting device may be supplied in  separable parts which can be packed flat, the parts being  interengaged during assembly of the drawer or other article  so that the projections and the wall panels or other compoÂ­ nents engaged therewith extend at right angles to one  another.

<DESCRIPTION>
titl@@ improvements @n @@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@ the invention relates to connecting devices for interconn@cti components ot right angles to one another and i especi@lly, but not exclusivcly applicable to components for use in the constructinn of articles of furniture including drawers. mony articles of furniture are suppli@d to customers in @ "knock-down" form, that is to say in the form of separote components which are @ssembled by the customer to form the artcle of furniture concerned. in the case of articles of furniture incorporating drawers the drawers are commonly olse supplied in "knock-down" form and comprise wall panels which are interconnected at right angles by corner connectors and are assembled in conjunction with a base and facio board to form a complete drawer assembly. dr@wers constructed in this m@nner c@n be pocked in relativoly flat form since the wall panels, base and focio all consist basically of flat boards. however the connecting members which are used to interconnect the wall panels ot right angles to one another have spigots or similar projoctions extending from them in two directions ot right angles and cannot therefore t;e packed flat. it is on object of the present invention to provide o connecting device for interconnecting components such os drawer wall panels ot ric'ht angles to one another in which this drow- back is obvieted er mitigated. according to the invention there is provided a connacting device for interconnecting components at right angles to @ne another and hoving projections adopted to engage with the ends of the components to be interconnected, the respective proj ections which eng@@@ with such components being carried en sep@rote parts nf tie connecting device which may he inter- engaged such thnt the respactive projections extend at right angles to one another. in this way the connocting device may be supplied to the customer in separable parts which can be packed flat, the parts being interengaged during assembly of the article such that the projections and the components engage therewith extend at right angles to one another. preferably one of said ports includes a corner piece on which the associated projection is carried, the corner piece being hollow ond bsina adapted to receive o portion of said other part, means being provided for enraging the said portion in the corner piece such that the respective projections extend from the assembled connecting device in two directions at right angles to one another. the connecting device may 5 provided with o single projection for engagement with each of the components to be interconnected or with a plurality of projections for each component. said portion of the part which engages with the hollow corner piece may extend into the corner piece from the side from which the projection or projections will extend after assembly or the part which engages with the corner piece may be arranged to pass through the corns piece from the opposite side. preferably the parts which form the connecting device are interengaged by means of internal projections in the hollow
