<ABSTRACT>
a first x-frame (10) comprising first and second pivotally  connected elongate members (4 and 5) is pivotally connected  to a second x-frame (33) comprising third and fourth pivotally  connected elongate members (27 and 28) by means of cross-­ braces (21, 22, 46 and 47) so that sleeves (11, 12, 36 and 37)  pivotally connected to the first ends (6, 8, 29 and 31) of the  elongate members (4, 5, 27 and 28) are slidably movable  along pivotally interconnected support arms (13, 14, 38 and  39).  as the x-frames (10 and 33) move towards each other, the  elongate members (4, 5, 27 and 28), the support arms (13, 14,  38 and 39), and the cross-braces (21, 22, 46 and 47) align  themselves substantially parallel to each other, the hems of a  container (55) of pliable material, which receive the support  arms (13, 14, 38 and 39) are gathered together and the con­ tainer (55) is compressed within the bundle of substantially  parallel members.
