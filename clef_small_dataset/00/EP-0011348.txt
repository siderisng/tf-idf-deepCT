<ABSTRACT>
packing containers of the non-returnable type are man­ ufactured from weblike packing material which by folding  and sealing is converted to parallelepipedic packing contain­ ers.  for reasons of geometry triangular corner lugs (5) are  formed in the preocess which are folded in and sealed to the  bottom wall of the packing container.  the folding takes place  along the edges of the bottom wall which adjoin the corner  lugs (5) but, since the corner lugs (5) consist of several layers  of material, they are difficult to fold in a sharp and well-­ defined manner, which has a negative effect on the flatness  of the bottom wall.  to facilitate the folding the corner lugs (5) are delimited  from the adjoining bottom wall by means of a crease line (10)  weakening the material which extends at an angle over the  bottom wall of the packing container.  as a result the material  will be folded on the one hand along the crease line, on the  other hand along the actual straight bottom wall edge which  appreciably improves the flatness of the packing container  bottom.
