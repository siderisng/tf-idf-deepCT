<ABSTRACT>
The measurement principle is based on the interference of light bundles (34, 35) which are reflected on the one hand from an uncovered part of the surface (30) of the opaque (or OPA ken) sample body (28) and on the other hand from a part of the surface, which with a throughSichti Also covered with etched layer (29). A optical arrangement consisting of a semi-permeable mirror (18) and two dichroi tables (20, 21) generates the two light beams (24, 25) for illumination of the sample surface and introduces the two reflected light bundles (34, 35) for interference, wherein The light paths have the same length. The semipermeably mirror (18) is inclined with respect to the light incident direction (16) according to the sample surface (16) and to the normal of the per ben surface by 45 °. The over or since the semi-permeable mirror (18) symmetrically on arranged, dichroic mirror (20 and 21) are inclined by 22.4 ° about the surface of the semi-permeable mirror (18). For measurement, light is used with a wel len length reflected by the dichroic mirrors (20, 21). A lighting device (110) for visual observation of the measuring surface is arranged behind one of the dichroic mirrors, the visual observation device (120) is located behind the other dichroic mirror. The etching rate of the opaque sample body is true with the formula d = λ / 2n-Δ × (n-1) from the peri δ of the intensity fluctuations of the output beam be determined in which the radiation reflected on the covered and uncovered opaque surface intersect ( N-refractive index of the transparent deck layer, Δ × etched part of the cover layer, γ = waves length, d = etched opaque layer).
