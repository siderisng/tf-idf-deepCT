<ABSTRACT>
a body implantable signal generator assembly comprises  a signal generator (13) and a performed connector (11)  mechanically secured to each other.  to avoid the use of  adhesive for securing the generator and connector together,  or mechanical means involving pivotable motion on assembly,  the generator (11) is provided with a plurality of posts  (23, 24) which are received in apertures (25, 26) formed in the  connector.  the posts (23, 24) are formed with keyways (41,  42, 51) through which locking members in the form of  wedge-shaped keys (43) pass, thus urging and securing  generator and connector together and compressing the  resilient washers (15, 16) provided therebetween.  on such  connection, terminals (17, 18) pass into terminals (30) for  connection the signal generator leads (not shown).
