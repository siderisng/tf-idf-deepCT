<ABSTRACT>
an improvement in carrying out assaying methods  involving bisospecific affinity reactions in which there are  used from two to four reactants, one of which reactants,  reactant (i), being labelled with at least one analytically indi­ catable atom or group and being soluble in the aqueous  liquid wherein the biospecific affinity reaction is carried out,  said reactants forming by biospecific affinity reactions a con­ jugate in which labelled reactant (i) is incorporated, and in  which methods the analytically indicatable atom or group is  assayed in the conjugate and/or in the free labelled reactant  (i), said improvement being characterized in   a) using as at least one of said reactants a reactant which  is modified in such a way that conjugate and free labelled  reactant (i) are asymmetrically partitioned in a system of two  immiscible aqueous liquid phases, which system in addition  to water comprises in dissolved form   i) at least two polymers or   ii) at least one polymer and at least one salt or   iii) at least one polymer and at least one organic solvent,   b) providing said system of two aqueous liquid phases,   c) partitioning of conjugate and free labelled reactant (i)  in said system of two aqueous liquid phases and   d) assaying the analytically indicatable atom or group in  at least one of the phases.
