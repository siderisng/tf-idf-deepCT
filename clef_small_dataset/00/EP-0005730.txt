<ABSTRACT>
in a two-chamber engine mount with hydraulic damping, especially for motor vehicles, the fluid-filled chambers (13, 14) of the said mount, which are connected to one another hydraulically via a restriction orifice (12), comprise a common dividing wall (18) connected to a metallic abutment (3), in each case a rubber-elastic circumferential wall (6, 7) and metallic end walls (4, 5) rigidly connected to one another, the rubber-elastic circumferential wall (6 or 7) of at least one chamber (13 or 14), especially the main chamber (13), is designed as a thrust spring in the form of a frustoconical hollow body.  to reduce the space requirement of the engine mount while retaining a good pumping and damping action, the rubber-elastic circumferential wall (6) designed as a thrust spring is subdivided into two partial thrust bodies (15, 16) arranged one above the other in the axial direction which are essentially square in cross-section and which are arranged at an angle with respect to one another and which are connected integrally to one another in the region of the angle, one partial thrust body (15) being connected to a conical outer surface (19) of the metallic end wall (4) and the other partial thrust body (16) being connected to a conical outer surface (20) of the abutment (3).  <image>
