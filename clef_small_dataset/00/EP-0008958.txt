<ABSTRACT>
new fluorinated benzenesulfonate diacetylene composi­ tions are described which are useful in time-temperature  devices for monitoring the shelf-lives of perishable articles.   the compositions are solid-state polymerizable by thermal  annealing or exposure to actinic or high energy ionizing  radiation.  some of the compositions, in addition, exhibit  relatively longer polymerization induction periods, com­ pared to other known diacetylene compositons, and an  "autocatalytic" effect upon polymerization during which a  rapid color change occurs.  these characteristics are  extremely useful in monitoring situations which require a  striking color change as an indication that a particular time-­ temperature history profile, e. g.  shelf-life, has expired.
