<ABSTRACT>
1.  a tight connecting device for two insulated electrical conductors permitting to assure simultaneously the electrical junction of the conductors and the dielectrical continuity of the insulators, comprising on the one hand a conductive sleeve (1) constituted of one piece of malleable material and having two cavities each of which receives one conductor (8) including an insulated part of the latter, and comprising on the other hand an insulating sleeve (2) which envelops said conductive sleeve, each conductor being held in its cavity after insertion by radial compression of the conductive sleeve at the level of the cavity, characterized in that at each end, the insulating sleeve is associated to an insulating tube (11), which enters by a first part into said cavity, whereas another part of it outside this cavity is fixed in a tight manner to the insulating sleeve (2).
