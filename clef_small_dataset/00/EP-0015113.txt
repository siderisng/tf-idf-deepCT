<ABSTRACT>
a belt, band or other tire component folding machine and  method are characterized by a rotatable and expandable  drum (46) comprising a substantially rigid cylinder deck (56)  having a precisely formed peripheral deck edge (174) and an  inflatable bladder assembly (60) positioned slightly axially  and radially inwardly subjacent the deck edge which cooper足 ate to define a precise fold line along the deck edge at which a  ply or belt band or the like is precisely and sharply folded.   preferably, dual inflatable bladders are employed at each end  of tho deck, one bladder being contiguous to the other and  arranged on inflation to walk up the precisely formed and  contoured deck edge to turn up the overhanging band end,  and the other arranged to push the first bladder axially  inwardly to complete the fold of the band flat upon itself.  a  preferred form of deck comprises a plurality of readily  replaceable segments (120) which are mounted in a self  aligning manner on a radially expandable and rotatable hub.   each segment includes a pair of interfitting outer-deck sec足 tions (140,142) which are movable axially of the drum towards  and away from each other to expand and contract the width of  the deck in precise increments.  various forms of the deck  further comprise spring gap shields (182) or elastic gap span足 ning bands (184) whicn circumscribe the deck at the deck  edges.  the various components are readily interchangeable  with components of different sizes and adjustable to accom足 modate different sizes of tire components.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: "belt folding machine & method" fjeld of the invention this invention relates generally to a tire building machine and more particularly to a belt or other tire component folding machine having provision for sharply folding tire components along precise fold lines, and a method for folding such components. background of the invention in the manufacture of belted tires and more particularly radial tires, it has been found desirable that the breaker or ply belts or the like serving as reinforcement members of tires be constructed with folded edges. this avoids sharp exposed edges. this may be done by folding the breakers or plies sharply on themselves or to wrap around the edge portions of the other contiguous breakers or plies. hence, the formation of the desired folded edges requires turning the circumferential edge portions of the endless breaker or ply belts along a fold line so that the so turned portions overlie adjacent circumferential portions of the belts. for precision tire making, formation of sharp and precise folds is particularly important. for example, such precise and sharp folding of the belts eliminates the need for subsequent sizing and trimming of the folded belts. heretofore, inflatable bags or bladders have been employed in tire building and belt folding machines to fold the breaker or ply belts and to carry out various other turning operations during building of tire components. reference may be had, for example, to applicants1 assignek's u.s. patent no. 3,438,832, dated april 15, 1969, which discloses a dual bladder construction in a tire building drum for turning a ply about a bead core to form a tire carcass. however, such machine is not designed to fold sharply a breaker or ply belt back upon itself. for examples of belt folding machines that employ inflatable bladders for folding a tire component belt back upon itself, reference may be had to the nebout u.s. patent no. 3,154,455, dated october 27, 1964, and wood et al u.s. patent no. 3,525,655, dated august 25, 1970. however, to obtain the desired folds, such machines employ rubber decks with vacuum hold downs to hold the belt to the drum and to attempt to define the fold line while the edge thereof is being folded. unfortunately, such types of belt folding machines using rubber decks with the bladders as a continuation thereof cannot with ensured repeatability obtain a precise fold edge. rubber is well known for its change in characteristics upon age and repeated use. ln some such prior art constructions employing inflatable bladders, the fold line may be defined solely by the configuration of the bladders. however, such constructions may be undesirable because no precise unyielding fold line is provided to ensure a precise and sharp fold. moreover, the expansion characteristics of the bladder may vary depending on ambient conditions or the condition of the bladder leading to undesirable fold dimensional variations from one cycle to the next. an exemplary belt folding machine of such prior art constructions is disclosed in head et al
