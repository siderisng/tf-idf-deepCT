<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for rotating an information stor­ age disc (11) about its central axis at a prescribed angular  velocity that varies according to the radial position of an  optical transducer (15) for recording information thereon,  whereby a uniformly high density of information can be  recorded over the entire disc.  the apparatus includes a regis­ ter (21) for storing a digital measure of the radius of the  current track being recorded by the transducer (15), along  with velocity signal circuitry for producing a disc velocity  signal having a frequency inversely proportional to the  measure of radius, and a spindle motor servo (25) responsive  to the disc velocity signal, for controlling the angular velocity  of the information disc (11) accordingly.  the velocity signal  circuitry includes a crystal oscillator (29) a counter (31) for  counting the clock pulses produced by the oscillator, (29) and  a digital word magnitude comparator (35) for generating a  reset pulse to reset the counter (31) to an initial zero count  every time it determines that the count is equal to the digital  measure of radius.  the disc velocity signal is then derived by  frequency dividing the successive reset pulses.
