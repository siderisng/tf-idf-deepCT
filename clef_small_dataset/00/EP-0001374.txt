<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to transistors of amplification and switching and, more particularly, the amorphous and metal-based semiconductor thin film transistors. Such a transistor that has continuously varying response characteristics depending on the input signals applied to its input terminals. It comprises two semiconductor films on both sides of the metal film constituting the base. At least one of the two semiconductor films, is amorphous material, and preferably is hydrogenated amorphous silicon. Referring to the figure, the metal base (12), platinum for example is disposed between the collector region (11) and the transmitter region (13), both of hydrogenated amorphous silicon, these two regions provided each of the Ohmic contact I, V each comprising a metal layer (10, 14) covered, for example, by a highly doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer (18, 19).
