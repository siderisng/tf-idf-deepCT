<ABSTRACT>
this invention is directed to a process for preparing high  molecular weight polyhydroxyether resins by reacting an  epoxy resin which is a glycidyl ether of a bisphenol with a  bisphenol in the presence of a solvent and a catalyst.  the  process is characterized by adding after the reaction between  the eopxy resin and the bisphenol is at least 97 percent complete  based upon the phenolic hydroxyl content from 0. 005 to  0. 12 phenolic hydroxyl equivalents of a halogenated bisphenol  per equivalent of the total phenolic hydroxyl content  of the bisphenol and the halogenated bisphenol.  the high  molecular weight polyhydroxyether resins produced by this  process are useful in coatings.
