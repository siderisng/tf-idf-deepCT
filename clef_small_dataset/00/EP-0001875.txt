<ABSTRACT>
a process for bonding low-energy plastic surfaces having  a critical surface tension of about 24 to about 37 dynes  per centimeter to each other which comprises: (a) heating  said surfaces that will be bonded to each other to a temperature  of at least 50°c, (b) applying an adhesive composition  effective in bonding low-energy plastic surfaces to each  other to at least one of said surfaces, said adhesive composition  comprising (1) an ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer having  from about 4 to about 50 weight percent of a vinyl ester; (2) a  tackifier and (3) a wax, and wherein said adhesive composition  is in a temperature range of about 90 to about 250°c at  the time of application and then (c) bringing said surfaces in  contact with each other.
