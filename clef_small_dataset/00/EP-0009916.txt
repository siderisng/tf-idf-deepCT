<ABSTRACT>
the machines may function as a rotary compressor,  vacuum pump, expansion engine or the like.  two inter­ engaging rotors (12, 14) rotate within intersecting bores  (16,18) in a casing structure (20).  two higher pressure  ports (36) are located one in each flat end wall of the cas­ ing (20).  one rotor (12) opens and closes the two higher  pressure ports (36) so as to control the flow of air or gas  through same.  the optimum number of teeth or lobes  (24,28) for each rotor (12, 14) is two.  the first port control­ ling rotor (12) has lobes (24) of small included angle so as  to reduce the effect of a precompression loss.  the coacting  second rotor (14) has lobes (28) of larger included angle so  as to improve performance.
