<ABSTRACT>
a cardiac pacemaker of the type responsive to heart activity to affect the operation of the pacemaker (e. g.  a demand pacemaker) includes a circuit for sensing heart activity which is substantially equally responsive to electrical heart activity signals of either polarity.  a differential-input differential-output preamplifier 20 is connected to sensing terminals 36, 37 and supplies two equal and opposite signals to an absolute value circuit 21 which produces a single polarity output representative of signals of either polarity at terminals 36,37.  circuit 21 may comprise two emitter followers with common base and emitter connections.  in an alternative embodiment an input signal is passed through an inverting amplifier to produce an equal and opposite signal and the two signals are again applied to an absolute value circuit.  a reversion circuit 22 detects heart activity to produce a "sense" output, e. g.  to digital pacemaker circuitry.  the reduced polarity disparity enables the reversion circuit sensitivity to be easily controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
cardiac pacemaker body implantable cardiac stimulators or pacemakers are known to the prior art. an early pacemaker is disclosed by greatbatch in u.s. patent no. 3,057,356, entitled "medical cardiac pace#aker", which issued in 1962. this device included a relax2 ion oscillator that generated electrical pulses at a fixed rate. the pulses were applied to the heart to cause the heart to contract each time a pulse occurred. pacing technology has lagged behind conventional state of the art electronic technology in its utilization of digital electronic circuits. one reason for this has been the high energy required to operate digital electronic circuits. energy requirements are a major concern in pacemaker design. however, with the continuing advances of electronic technology, digital electronic circuits are increasingly feasible within the context of commercial pacemaker units. the accuracy and reliability of digital electron ic circuits are factors that encourage their use within the pacemaker context. the facility with which they can be programmed and reprogrammed to alter one or more operating parameters further enhances their utility. for example, macemakers have been disclosed which respond to magnetic #nd/or radio frequency signals to alter an operating para filter. pulse rate and pulse width may be programmed in tunis manner. in addition, pacemakers have been constructed which are inhibited in the presence of certain signals, al tough no known prior art pacemaker is capable of havinq a than two parameters, features or tests programmed on . > .nand. s the implementation of digital electronic circuitry xeithin the pacemaker context provides the opportunity to rogram or reprogram one or several operating parameters, on command, via externally generated signals. for example, :::se rate, pulse width and pulse amplitude can be external 1je established at one of any number of combinations. in addition, the refractory period may be established and stored. further, digital circuitry can be programmed on emporary or permanent basis, as desired. of course, otter operating parameters or characteristics can also be externally programmable. clearly then, a pacemaker utilizing digital electonic circuitry would have a more universal application by allowing the pacemaker to be programmed to fit the needs of a particular application as opposed to being manufactured for limited applications. in addition, such a unit can be instructed to give an external indication of its program status, particularly in instances where that status is not directly observable. however, even with the implementation of digital circuitry, certain analog circuitry is necessary to generate and/or transmit various control signals and to respond to the digital circuitry to effect its programming. the present invention relates to analog circuitry .#t#rded for cooperation with digital circuitry to assist in the performance of the pacemaking function. among the analog circuit functions necessary within the context of a digital pacemaker are the demodulation of a programming signal, the detection of heart activity during operation in a demand mode and provision of clock pulses. additionally, analog circuitry may be employed to give an indication of battery status and to impose an upper rate limit on the
