<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a blend of poly(p-methylstyrene) with a  small amount of a polyfunctional monomer, such as  trimethylpropane trimethacrylate.  the blend can be formed  into shaped articles, such as food containers, which can be  crosslinked by irradiation at low doses.  such irradiated artiÂ­ cles are resistant to fatty foods at microwave oven conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
blemds of poly(p-methylstyrene) ;etch polyfunctional monomer this invention relates blends of poly (p-methylstyrene) with polyfunctional monomers, which can be crosslinked by ionizing radiation at low dcag levels. the present invention provides a blend of rot (p-methylstyrene) with from 0.1 to 10 weight percent ot a polyfunctional monomer. the monomer used in preparing the homopolymer or copolymers from which the blends of this invention are made is p-methylstyrene. it is within the contemplation of this invention to use mixtures of methylstyrene rich in p-methylstyrene. such mixtures contain at least 95 weight percent, preferably 97-99 weight percent, p-methylstyrene and less than 0.1 weight percent o-methylstyrene with the balance being m-methylstyrene. a typical mixture contains, by weight, about 95 percent p-methylstyrene, about 5 percent m-methylstyrene, and about 0.05 percent o-methylstyrene. the mixtures are obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of the mixtures of ethylmethyl benzene isomers described in u.s. patent no. 4,086,287. the polymers contemplated herein are p-methylstyrene or p-methylstyrene-rich isomer mixture homopolymer or their copolymers containing between about 10 and about 1 weight percent conjugated diene, such as butadiene and isoprene. the polymerization reaction is carried out by using methods and catalysts well known in the art for polymerizing styrene. the reaction can be carried out in solution, bulk, suspension, or emulsion. the material that is blended with the poly(p-methylstyrene) is a polyfunctional (polyunsaturated) monomer. typical monomers contemplated are divinylbenzene; neopentylglycol diacrylate; trimethylolpropane triacrylate; trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate; allyl methacrylate; pentaerythritol triacrylate; pentaerythritol tetramethacrylate; butylene glycol dimethacrylate; tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate; 1 ,6-hexnediol dimethacrylate; 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate; diethyleneglycol diacrylate; diethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; n-hexenyl methacrylate; polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; diethylene glycol dimethacrylate; and diallyl fumarate. small amounts of polyfunctional monomers are effective to induce crosslinking by radiation at low dosage level. generally, from 0.1 to 10 weight percent, preferably from 0.5 weight to 5 weight percent, will be used. blending can be effected in a variety of ways, such as in solution in aromatic solvents, such as toluene, from which sheets or films can be cast. the blend components can be mixed in a tumbling agitator and fed into an extruder to produce sheets, films, or foamed sheets, or they can be fed separately to an extruder for extruder blending. the blends of this invention can be formed into sheets, films, or foamed sheets and thermoformed to produce shaped articles, such as food containers. after being irradiated, such shaped articles are heat resistant and are not affected by fatty foods under microwave oven conditions. ionizing radiation is inclusive of extremely short-wavelength, high energetic, penetrating rays such as gamma rays, x-rays, and subatomic particles accelerated in cyclotrons, betatrons, synchrotrons, and linear accelerators. the effect of irradiating the shaped articles is to cross-link the poly (p-methylstyrene) blend. the irradiation dose can be between about 20 megarads and about 45 megarads, whereas poly(p-methylstyrene) requires between about 50 megarads and about 60 megarads. similar blends using polystyrene are not crosslinked at low dosages. example poly(p-methylstyrene) (ppms), containing 3% meta isomer and 0.1% ortho isomer, was dissolved in toluene at a concentration of 25
