<ABSTRACT>
the terminal (14) comprises a contact arm (26) and a  wedge arm (28).  when the terminal has been inserted into a  cavity (22) of a housing (66), the wedge arm (28) is moved  relative to the contact arm (26) inwardly of the cavity (22) to  force the contact arm (26) against a wire (2) to drive it against a  wall (70) of the cavity (22).  in order to enable the size of the terminal (14) to be  reduced, the wedge arm (28) is contiguous with, and is slid­ able along, the contact arm (26), the contact portion (34) of the  latter initially extending across the leading end (40) of the  wedge arm (28) so that the contact portion (34) is displaced  towards the wall (70) by the wedge arm (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
an electrical terminal and an electrical connector. this invention relates in general to the art of making electrical line connections and relates in particular to an electrical terminal and to an electrical connector which are suitable for the termination of fine wires, e.g. of a.w.g. (american wire gauge) 32 to 50. we have described in our united states patent specification no. 4,026,013 an electrical terminal for establishing electrical connection with a wire which extends into a cavity in a housing, the terminal comprising a contact arm and a wedge arm in juxtaposed relationship, the wedge arm being movable with respect to the contact arm in the longitudinal direction thereof, one end of the contact arm projecting beyond an end of the wedge arm; whereby upon the insertion of the terminal into the cavity with the one end of the contact arm leading and with the contact arm adjacent to the wire, and then advancing the wedge arm relative to the contact arm, into the cavity, the contact arm is moved against the wire to clam#p the wire against the wall of the cavity to establish electrical connection with the wire. although this known terminal has indeed proved to be useful for terminating the windings of small electrical coils, there are nevertheless cases where the known terminal cannot be made small enough to comply with coil manufacturers requirements as to space limitations in the known terminal the contact arm and the wedge arm are spaced from one another by a transverse strut which connects the leading ends of the contact arm and the wedge arm, the strut being accordingly acutely angled ith respect to the contact arm and obtusely angled with respect to the wedge arm. as the wedge arm is advanced, the strut is driven towards a position in which it extends at right angles to the contact arm, so that the whole terminal is in effect expanded in the cavity to move the contact arm against the wire. the invention proceeds from the realization that the size of the terminal can be greatly reduced by arranging the contact arm and the wedge arm in contiguous relationship, the wedge arm being slidable along the contact arm to straighten an obliquely extending contact portion of the contact arm so as to drive such portion against the wire. according to one aspect of the invention, a terminal as defined in the second paragraph of this specification is characterised in that the contact arm comprises a substantially straight shank portion, and a contact portion extending obliquely from the shank portion and transversely of the wedge arm, the contact arm and the wedge arm being held in contiguous relationship and the wedge arm being slidable along the shank portion of the contact arm towards the one end of the contact arm to drive the contact portion thereof towards a position of longitudinal alignment with the shank portion thereof according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an electrical connector comprising a housing
