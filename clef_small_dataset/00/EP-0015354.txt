<ABSTRACT>
a stirrup machine for bending metallic stock material  such as bars, wires strips and the like and forming indivi­ dual bent pieces therefrom including: advancing and re­ versing and other suitable means (1) for the feed of the  stock material (2) and to retract the finished bent product;  shear and guide means (3) for said stock material (2);  bending means (4) comprising an interchangeable fixed  central bending fork (7) to guide and support said stock  material (2) and a bending pin (8) for bending said stock  material (2) around the central fork (7) in a clockwise or  counterclockwise direction.  the invention is characterized  in that the stock guide means (5) is transversally movable  forward and backward to push the stock material (2) out  of the bending plane, to disengage it from the bending  means (4) or to recall the stock material to reengage it  with the respective bending means (4) and to shear it in  connection with a countershear (6) after the stock mate­ rial (2) has completed ad a stirrup.
