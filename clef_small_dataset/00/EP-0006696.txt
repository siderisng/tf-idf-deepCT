<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to apparatus for spreading fibres  uniformly over a forming surface, wherein a fibre distribu足 tor chamber (10) is furnished with an impeller (14 etc. ) to  eject fibres onto the forming surface which comprises a  foraminous conveyor (28) to create a fibrous, felted mat on  the conveyor.  the distributor has a fibre discharge opening  provided with a foraminous screen through which the fi足 bres are ejected.  to prevent anisotropy in the mat arising from the fi足 bres tending to align themselves with the direction of travel  of the conveyor (28), the discharge opening screen (12) is  continuously movable across the said opening in the same  direction as the conveyor (28) and at substantially the sa足 me speed.  the fibres come to rest on the conveyor (28)  randomly oriented and the resulting mat has substantially  isotropic properties.
