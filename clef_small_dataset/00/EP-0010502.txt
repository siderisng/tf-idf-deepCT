<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a variolating inductance comprising a first closed magnetic circuit (m), formed of an anisotropic material through which circulates an alternating magnetic field and a second closed magnetic circuit (N), also formed of a material Anisotropic, to Travers which circulates an adjustable DC magnetic field. The first and second magnetic circuits are arranged relative to each other so as to define at least two common magnetic spaces (D1, D2) in which the alternative and continuous magnetic fields are orthogonally superimposed to orient the magnetic dipoles of spaces. spaces Common magnetics according to a direction pre determined by the intensity of the second circuit DC magnetic field and for thus controlling the permeabi lity of the first magnetic circuit in the alternating field. Arrangements for use in single-phase and intersecting variable inductance comprising self-control with or without reverse control.
