<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a heat-exchanger (1) provided  with channels (3, 4, 401) for at least two fluids and having  a hydraulic diameter not greater than 3 mm.  the wall  (404) of the channels may consist of different polymeric  materials and is covered with a thin coating (402, 405),  more particularly a metal, such as aluminium.  the coating  is impermeable to fluids to such a degree that the water  vapour permeability of the wall of the channels is reduced  to below 1 g/mÂ² 24 hours.  groups of at least 50 channels  are provided, each group forming a layer of channels and  several layers (2) forming a block (1).  each group is  provided with connections for transporting a fluid.  the  exchange of heat takes place between the successive  layers (2).
