<ABSTRACT>
a dispensing instrument with supported balloon (46)  having a dispenser operable to place drug material into  the uterine cavity and an expandable balloon (46) coopÂ­ erating with support structure (59) operable to move the  drug material from the uterine cavity into both canals of  the fallopian tubes.  the instrument housing carries a  piston/cylinder assembly.  the balloon (46) is attached to  a flexible tubular probe (43) mounted on one housing end.   the piston/cylinder assembly is operable to fully collapse  the balloon (46).  after the balloon (46) is inserted through  the cervical opening into the uterine cavity, a drug ampulla  is loaded into the instrument.  the piston/cylinder  assembly is actuated to initially expand the balloon (46)  and move a plunger into the ampulla to dispense drug  material into the uterine cavity.  the balloon (46) is then  fully expanded to move the drug material into the canals  of the fallopian tubes.  the balloon support structure (59)  prevents the balloon (46) from expanding back through  the cervical opening into the vaginal passage.  the support  structure (59) is a monofilament nylon (61, 62, 63, 64)  arranged in intersecting latitudinal and longitudinal  directions about a lower ballon (46) portion.
