<ABSTRACT>
a gable-topped, flat-bottomed carton has a side seam  (29) which, in a fin (11-17) of the gable top closure, fits in a gap  between respective junctions of two pairs (12 and 13, 15 and  16) of internal sub-panels of the fin.  two opposite external  sub-panels (11 and 14) of the fin have tabs (33 and 34) for  pulling to open the closure to form a spout.  the seam edge of  one oblique sealing sub-panel (8) of the closure has a tab (36),  with scorelines (37) from the tab (36) into that sub-panel (8),  while the seam edge of the other oblique sealing sub-panel (6)  has a corresponding recess (38) covered by the one oblique  sealing sub-panel (8), so that pulling of the tab (36) tears back  the sub-panel portion between the scorelines (37) to expose  the recess (38).  the flat bottom closure has at the free edge of  its widest sub-panel a sealing projection (31) of a width of  about one third of that of the sub-panel to facilitate interdigita­ tion of the blanks.
