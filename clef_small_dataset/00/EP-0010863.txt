<ABSTRACT>
an antifriction bearing support (12) disclosed includes  an outer support member (50) for mounting thereof on a  spindle housing (16) and an inner support member (52)  for mounting an antifriction bearing (42) which rotatably  supports a spindle (38).  the support also includes at least  one flexible diaphragm (54) extending between the inner  and outer support members to radially fix the inner sup­ port member and the antifriction bearing and preload the  antifriction bearing axialiy with respect to the axis of spindle  rotation so as to permit high speed spindle rotation.  prefer­ ably, a pair of the diaphragms (54) are utilized and are  mounted in a spaced and parallel relationship to each other.   inner and outer round edges of the diaphragms are secur­ ed between axial surfaces (80, 82, 88, 90) of the support  members and associated retaining ring (76, 78, 84, 86)  that have soldered connections to the support members.   threading of the outer support member onto the housing  flexes the diaphragms to provide the preloading of the  antifriction bearing mounted by the diaphragm support.   another antifriction bearing (48) on the housing is also  preloaded through the spindle by the diaphragms.  a first  end of the inner support member includes an opening (112)  that receives the antifriction bearing (42) and a second  end of the inner support member includes a heat exchanger  (116) for removing heat.  an oil-mist lubrication system  feeds an oil-mist lubricant to the antifriction bearings and  to the heat exchanger so as to increase the speed at which  the spindle can be rotated.
