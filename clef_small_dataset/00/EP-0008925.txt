<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for dissolving a solid (especially chlorine  solids) in a liquid has an inlet line (16) to and a return line (20)  from its tank (12) in which a tubular and apertured cartridge  (74) contains the solids to be dissolved.  the tank end portion (34) of the return line is inserted an  adjustable depth into the tank (12) allowing adjustment of  the water flow across the solid to be dissolved and hence of  the rate of dissolution of the latter.  the intake line (16) has a  connector (48) a tubular part of which extends into the liquid  line (22) and has an opening (50) facing upstream, and  analogously a connector (52) of the return line (20) has an  opening (54) facing downstream.  a hand operable valve (56)  and a flow meter (58) are connected in-line with the tank in  the intake line (16).  the tank end portion (58) of the intake  line (16) extends downwardly into the tank and is encircled  by a vertically movable pipe (70) which can rest on the bot­ tom of the tank (12), and the portion (68) has at least one hole  below the level of the top of the encircling pipe (70) for vent­ ing air from the line.  to allow convenient recharging of solids to the tank (12)  a screwed lid (94) of an orifice (78) to the tank may be  arranged to be rotated by the shaft of a tool exerting a couple  about an axis transverse both to that of the shaft and of the  lid.  the arrangement shows readily adjustable and controll­ able continuously operable dissolution of solids, especially  chlorine solids for swimming pools, without the use of an  additional power source.
