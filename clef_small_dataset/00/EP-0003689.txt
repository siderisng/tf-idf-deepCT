<ABSTRACT>
a dry release transfer is disclosed in which a releasable  layer (9) is adhered to a carrier sheet (1) and a stress-resisting  transferable design layer (3, 4) is printed on the  releasable layer.  the releasable layer (2) is normally prestressed  in the region (5), of transferable layer so that  when an external force is applied to the carrier sheet,  e. g.  by rubbing with a stylus, this force is transmitted to  the releasable layer (2).  since the releasable layer cannot  yield to the applied force by stretching, because it is  held by the stress-resisting layer, the adhesive bond between  the releasable layer and the carrier sheet (1) is  weakened or is ruptured or partial or complete cohesive  failure occurs within the releasable layer, thereby facilitating  transfer of the design layer.  a method of producing  such transfers is also disclosed.
