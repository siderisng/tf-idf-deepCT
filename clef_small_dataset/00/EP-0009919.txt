<ABSTRACT>
reciprocating drive means powered by a fluid such as  compressed air comprising an elongate inner member (1)  with a plurality of passageways (a to e) therein, an outer  member (2) slidable on the inner member and a shuttle  member (3) slidable with respect to the inner member and  within the outer member, the passageways in the inner  member being variously and intermittently so connected in  use, by ports (a1 to e2) in the inner member, to each other by  way of compartments (23 and 26 to 29) provided within the  outer member and the shuttle that, upon connection of a  determined one (1) of said passageways to a fluid pressure  source or a vacuum source, the outer member (2) moves with  reciprocating action with respect to the inner member.  the  elongate inner member has two fixed discs (11,12) thereon,  between which discs the shuttle member (3) oscillates the  discs having seals on their peripheral surfaces to seal against  the inner wall of the outer member, the outer member is  cylindrical with end walls (15,16) having seals alidable on the  elongate inner member and cooparating with ports (d1 and  e2) therein respectively and the shuttle member has axially  spaced seals on its inner peripheral surface to cooperate with  ports (b1 and c1) in the inner member and to seal against the  elongate member and define one (23) of the compartments  therebetween.  following movement of the outer member (2)  in one direction, the shuttle member (3) is moved by pressure  in an opposite direction to cause the outer member (2) to  move in said opposite direction.
