<ABSTRACT>
particulate fabric washing detergent compositions are  made with mixed phosphate detergency builders which com­ prise at least 5% of a water-soluble alkali metal polymer phos­ phate and at least 2% of an alkali metal orthophosphate in the  ratio of 10:1 - 1:5 parts by weight, the total amount of these  phosphates being from 10% to 40% of the composition and  not more than 10% of other phosphate builders being present,  together with 0. 01% to 10% of an anti-deposition agent which  is preferably an anionic polyelectrolyte.

<DESCRIPTION>
detergent colf?ositions the present invention relates to powdered detergent compositions which are adapted for fabric washing, and which contain synthetic detergent active compounds together with mixed phosphate detergency builders. the invention concerns in particular the production of detergent compositions which contain levels of the mixed phosphate detergency builders which can be lower than conventional phosphate builder levels, but which still retain good detergency properties. according to the present invention, a particulate' detergent composition based on mixed phosphate detergency builders comprises a synthetic anionic, nonionic1 amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compound or mixture thereof, an alkali metal orthophosphate, an alkali metal or ammonium polymer phosphate and an antideposition agent as defined below. in uk patent no. 1,530,799 we described and claimed powdered alkaline fabric washing detergent compositions which essentially contain mixed alkali metal tripolyphosphate and alkali metal orthophosphate detergency builders in the ratio of from 10:1 to 1:5 parts by weight. these compositions were found to have surprisingly good detergency properties though containing lower levels of the phosphate detergency builders than in conventional sodium tripolyphosphate-based detergent compositions. this development enabled either a reduction in manuiacturing cost because the difference in phosphate content could be made up with a chcaper filler, or an improvemellt in overall detergency by adding extra bleach or other additive instead. additionally, this development iacilitated the achievement of decreased phosphorus levels in detergent products to meet present or expected legislation. products of the type described in our aforementioned patent have already met with appreciable commercial success, especially as economy brands. however, one potential problem which has been found with the detergent compositions based on mixed alkali metal tripolyphosphate and orthophosphate builders, is the level of inorganic deposits which are some times found on washed fabrics and to a lesser extent surfaces in washing machines, especially heater elements. the present invention is directed to decreasing the level of such deposits whilst retaining benefits of good detergency building properties. wn1ilst not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the partial or complete replacement of the sodium tripolyphosphate in the detergent compositions of our afore-mentioned patent by the alkali metal or ammonium polymer phosphate gives less inorganic deposition on the washed fabrics, because the polymer phosphate has a decreased tendency to degrade to alkali metal pyrophosphate during the washing process. also, by adding some and preferably all or at least a major part of the polymer 'phosphate to the detergent composition in discrete particulate form, as distinct from including the polymer phosphate in a spray dried base powder, the degradation of the polymer phosphate during spray drying which would form more alkali metal pyrophosphate can be avoided. we have found that the presence in the detergent composition of any such alkali metal pyrophosphate contributes particularly to inorganic deposits on the washing machines. thus, by hindering the formation of alkali metal pyrophosphate during the washing process, and preferably also avoiding or substantially decreasing initial presence of the, pyrophosphate in the detergent compositions, a major step forward is taken to control inorganic
