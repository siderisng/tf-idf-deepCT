<ABSTRACT>
a resistance ladder having a plurality of resistance  branches in an integrated circuit chip, including a layer of  resistive material (10) defining a plurality of discrete linear  segments (12) and a plurality of connector tabs (14) extend­ ing from each of the linear segments at predetermined  intervals for defining each resistance branch: wherein the  layer of resistive material further defines a number of  curvilinear segments (16) for connecting the linear segments  to provide a continuous resistive material layer for defining  said resistance ladder.  each curvilinear segment is approxi­ mately a segment of a circle.  the resistive material layer also  defines a plurality of connector tabs (18) extending from  each curvilinear segment; with the angular separation of the  tabs being approximately defined by    wherein r is the resistance required for each leg of the  resistance ladder;   p is the sheet resistance of the resistive material;   r₁ is the inner radius of said circle; and   r₂ is the outer radius of said circle.
