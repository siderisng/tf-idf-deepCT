<ABSTRACT>
poly-3-hydroxybutyric acid is separated from bacterial  cells by drying a finely divided stream or spray of an aqueous  suspension of the cells with a gas heated to above 100°c and  then extracting the phb, preferably after a lipid extraction step  with a solvent such as methanol or acetone, with a phb-­ solvent such as a partially halogenated hydrocarbon such as  1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform or dichloromethane.  1,2-­ dichloroethane may also be used to extract phb directly from  an aqueous cell suspension without an intermediate drying  step.  in this case, for some bacteria, the suspension is prefer­ ably subjected to a cell disruption step, eg milling, prior to  contact with the 1,2-dichloroethane.

<DESCRIPTION>
extraction process this invention relates to an extraction prooess ani in particular to a process of extracting poly-3 -hydroxybutyric a=id, hereinafter ref erred to as phb from microbial cells. it has been knows since the 1920 s that many micro-organisms are capable of accumulating granules of phb within their cells as an energy reserve material. it has been proposed in usp 3107172 to dry such ph3 containing bacterial cells, for example by spray drying, and to use the resultant dried cells as moulding compositions. suggestions have also been made to extract pe3 from bacterial cells and to use it as a plastics material, but methods so far disclosed have not been economlcally acceptable. in order to extract the phb, it is generally necessary to contact the bacterial cells with a solvent in which phb is soluble to leach out the plib from the remainder of the bacterial cell material. some bacteria, for example members of the genus azotobacter readily yield up their pbb to the extraction solvent, whereas other bacteria, eg pseudomonadaceae have more robust cells and require a cell disruption step prior to contact with the extraction solvent. methods of extraction previously proposed have included the steps of ha-zesting the bacterial cells from the aqueous fermentation medium, eg by centrifugation, to give a mass of wet cells which are then contacted with acetone to effect drying and cell breakage. after removal of the acetone, the phb is extracted with a suitable solvent, eg pyridine (usp 3036959) or a dichloromethanes ethanol mixture tsp 3044942). such methods have the advantage that in addition to effecting drying and cell breakage, acetone also extracts lipids and pigments (if any) which would otherwise contamlnate the product. however treatment of a mass of wet cells with acetone to effect drying and cell breakage is not economic on 4 large scale. another method is described in usp 3275610 wherein a ispersion of bacterial cells in water is subjected to ultrasonic vibration to rupture the cells followed by centrifugation and drying before extraction with a solvent such as chloroform. after reparation of the phb from the chloroform solution, the pex is washed to extract lipids therefrom. it has also been proposed in usp 4101533 to extract phb from dried cells, or directly from a wet mass of cells harvested rrom the fermentation medium by centrifugation, by heating the cells with certain cyclic carbonate solvents. it is also possible to extract p33 directly from the aqueous cell suspension produced by fermentation, preferably after some concentration, by contact with certain solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, or 1,2-dichloroethane with, where necessary, a cell disruption step, eg milling, prior to contact with the solvent. however the solvent, and extraction conditions, have to be selected with care to avoid undue uptake by the solvent of non-tb material particularly lipids and pigment (if any) present in the bacterial cell. not only does such non-phb material contaminate the product and so present purification difficulties but also the co-extraction of lipids may tend to result
