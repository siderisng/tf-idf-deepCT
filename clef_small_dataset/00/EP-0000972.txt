<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to novel 3-phenyl-indoles of the formula <chem>  wherein x and y are independently hydrogen or halogen atoms;  each n is 1, 2 or 3,  q is an oxygen atom or the group (h,oh), z is a hydrogen atom, or provided that q is an oxygen atom, z can also be the group or, wherein r is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl or loweralkoxy-loweralkyl group, "lower" indicating groups with 1-6 carbon atoms, m is 1 or 2 when z is a hydrogen atom and m is o when z is the group or, to their preparation, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.  these compounds have immunosuppressant activity and can be used for example in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
