<ABSTRACT>
printing apparatus comprises input sheet feed means for  feeding sheets from input stackers (14,16) in a first path via  paper drum (18) and feed rolls (20) to an electrophotographic  imaging apparatus with drum (24) and discharge device (28)  to print one side of a sheet and an output sheet feed means to  feed the sheet in a second path via sheet feed (29) and fuser  station (32) from the imaging apparatus to an output stacker  (36).  duplexing sheet feed means with duplex drum (34) can  be selectively actuated to divert the sheet from an intermediÂ­ ate point in the second path along a third path via staging  drum (40) to an intermediate point in the first path.  in the third  path the sheet is flipped into the sheet flipper means (38) so  that when fed back along the first path by the input sheet feed  means via staging drum (40) and feed rolls (20), the imaging  apparatus with drum (24) and discharge device (28) can print  an image on the other side of the sheet.  the apparatus is  designed to accommodate a plurality of different sheet sizes  by selective control of pressure and vacuum.
