<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides 1-substituted-3-acylpyrroles of the formula:-  <chem>  wherein  c integral  is an optionally substituted phenyl group, a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group, branched alkyl group, or optionally substituted heterocyclic group, r1 is hydrogen or an alkyl group and r2, r3 and r4 are such that the substituent linked to the n-atom in the 1-position contains an alcoholic hydroxyl group, an ether group, a thioether group or a functional group derived from oxidation of these groups linked to the n-atom through a chain of two carbon atoms.   <??>the compounds of the invention, unlike known 3-acyl-1-substituted pyrrole derivatives, have high platelet aggregation inhibiting activities and low antiinflammatory activities.   <??>they may be made by acylating a 1-substituted pyrrole in the 3-position by reaction with an anhydride or halide of a carboxylic acid of the formula  c integral cooh, in the presence of an acid catalyst, and if desired subjecting the products to oxidation, hydrolysis, amidation or acetal-forming reaction.
