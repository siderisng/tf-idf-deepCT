<ABSTRACT>
moulded wafer products are prepared by a novel process  in novel apparatus from dough of high sugar content  (25-60% w/w based on the farinaceous dough ingredient) by  a two-stage process comprising initial baking of a light-tex­ tured water material (e. g.  2-3 mm thick), introducing the waf­ er while still hot (e. g.  above 160-195°c), into a cooling and  compressing mould (3,4,5) of the apparatus, and compress­ ing the wafer to reduce its wall thickness, e. g.  by about  15-50%.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus bor prepartng moulded wafers the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for preparing moulded wafers from baking dough, e.g. dough with high sugar content. while it is possible to bake hollow wafers from dough having a low sugar content, e.g. of 5% (by weight based on the weight of the dry farinaceous component), without problems arising, when higher sugar content is used special steps should be taken to allow steam and gases to escape and to provide wafers of a satisfactory quality and solidity. it has therefore been proposed, for example, to open the baking mould a few times for a moment during baking, or first to bake a light wafer in the baking mould which is initially only partly filled, and to compress this in a final baking step, after addition of the rest of the dough, in a second cycle of the baking mould. hollow wafers from dough with high sugar content (e.g. 250-600/0, e.g. about 35 / > 145%) tend¯to stick to the baking moulds and, when they are extracted from the baking moulds and during subsequent cooling, can still assume another shape. however, hollow wafers differing from one another in form and dimension are unsatisfactory for filling with, e.g. ice cream, in high-speed filling machines. it has already been recommended in us patent specification 2,069,027 to restore cones, the circular cross-section of which assumes an elliptical shape when they are extracted from the baking mould, to their initial shape in a cooling mould. according to the invention to be described below, hollow wafers can be prepared from a dough of high sugar content, e.g. about 25 to 60% (calculated on the weight of dry farinaceous components, e.g. the flour or starch used or of the mixture of these components), which wafers can be given a gatissactorxly reproducible uniform shape and, in particular, satisfactorily uniform dimensions and shape about their edges at their open ends. according to the invention there is provided a process for preparing a moulded wafer from a dough of high sugar content, in which the wafer is baked in a baking mould, is introduced into a cooling mould while still hot and stiffens there -in a- shape given to the cooling mould, characterised in that firstly a moulded wafer is baked, starting from a dough with a sugar content in the range 25%-60% based on the weight of the farinaceous dough components, the wafer having a light porous structure, and this moulded wafer is solidified while cooling by compressing its structure and surface by reduction of its wall thickness in a cooling and compressing mould. also provided by the invention is apparatus for carrying out a process for preparing moulded wafers, consisting of baking apparatus comprising baking moulds and a final shaping device, characterised in that the final shaping device is a cooling mould, the hollow mould space of which is smaller than that of the baking mould and corresponds with the accurmately determined dimensions to be given
