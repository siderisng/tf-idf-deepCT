<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a method and apparatus  whereby toe portions of knitted hoses, successively fed in a  suspended condition with their toe portions uppermost, are,  at a first station (a), trimmed by a cutter (8 to 13) to remove  the odds and ends of said toe portions individually to align  the edges of said toe portions, closed at a second station (b)  by an individual first linking operation, and finally, at a third  station (c), are subjected to a second linking operation in  which first linking stitches effected in said first linking operaÂ­ tion are covered by second linking stitches.
