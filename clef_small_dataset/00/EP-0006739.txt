<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns the use as an antiperspirant  active compound of a basic aluminium chloride, bromide  or iodide having an aluminium to chloride, bromide or  iodide molar ratio of from 0. 5 to 2. 5:1 in the form of a pow­ der or an aqueous solution having an aluminum concen­ tration of at least 2. 5% by weight, the basic aluminium  compound exhibiting on analysis by a size exclusion chro­ matographic method a fraction (referred to as the band iii  fraction) having a relative retention time within the range  of 0. 76 to 0. 82 in which fraction there is contained at least  20% of the aluminium.  the compound has less than 20%  of the total aluminium contained in polymers having a size  greater than 100 angstroms.

<DESCRIPTION>
inhibition of perspiration this invention relates to the inhibition of perspiration by the application to the skin of antiperspirant active compounds. in our copending german application p 27 00 711.0 we have described basic aluminium chloride, bromide, iodide and nitrate compounds having enhanced antiperspirant activity. although basic aluminium compounds are well known to have antiperspirant activity it has been shown in the copending application referred to that an enhancement in the antiperspirant activity of basic aluminium compounds having an aluminium to chloride, bromide, iodide or nitrate molar ratio of from 1.3 to 6.5:1 can be obtained by prolonged heating of aqueous solutions of said compounds under certain conditions leading to the formation of higher polymeric species having a size above 100 angstroms. the antiperspirant active compounds having enhanced activity are defined in the said copending application as those which in water form an aqueous solution in which there is at least 2% by weight of the total aluminium contained in polymeric species having a size greater than 100 angstroms. the. copending application shows that various factors are important in determining whether and at what rate the defined higher polymeric species are formed. one factor of importance is the concentration of the aqueous solution of the basic aluminium compound, increasing concentration acting to reduce the rate of production of polymers having a size greater than 100 angstroms. data given in the copending application show that antiperspirant activity of the basic aluminium compound increased as the content of the higher polymers in the heat treated solution increased up to a point at which between about 40% and 60% of the aluminium was contained in polymers having a size above 100 angstroms. commercially available basic aluminium compounds, and in particular those sold for antiperspirant use, do not, so far as is kno°m, contain in aqueous solution polymers having an effective diameter above 100 angstroms. we have now made a further discovery concerning the characterisation of basic aluminium chloride, bromide and iodide compounds which have especially good antiperspirant activity which does not depend on the requirement that their aqueous solution should contain at least 2% of the aluminium contained, in polymers exceeding 100 angstroms in effective diameter, and indeed they may in aqueous solution contain substantially no polymers of such size. the basic aluminium compounds employed in the present invention for inhibiting perspiration, have an aluminium to chloride, bromide or iodide molar ratio of from 0.5 to 2.5:1 and have such size distribution of polymeric species that in the size exclusion chromatographic procedure described herein there is eluted a fraction between the relative retention times of 0.76 and 0.82 in which fraction there is contained at least 20% of the total aluminium of the compound. for convenience, such fraction is referred to hereinafter as the band iii fraction. according to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a method of inhibiting perspiration comprising applying to the skin a polymeric antiperspirant compound which is a basic aluminium chloride, bromide or iodide having an aluminium to
