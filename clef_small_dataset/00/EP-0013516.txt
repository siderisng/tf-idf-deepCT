<ABSTRACT>
1.  profiled upright support, with rack, constituted by a channel having a section in the form of at least an >>h<<, of which the transverse web (1) has equidistant apertures (2), constituting the rack proper, and of which the edges of the edges of the two parallel arms (3, 4) intended to bear against the partition wall are extended by return walls (5, 6) towards the exterior at right angles, forming feet, provided with holes (30) permitting their fixation by screws on the support, associated with a pair of removable covers intended to hide the whole of the channel, characterized in that each cover is constituted by a counter-channel (11, 12, 22, 23), dimensioned so as to cover preferably the whole of the channel, of which the lateral edges (23, 29) are flush with the ends (24, 25) of the right-angled return walls of the channel and of which the opposite edges (26, 27) bearing against the flanges (15, 16) of the channel are extended beyond the same in such a manner so to form flexible lips (19, 20) hiding all or part of the rack (2), a system of clipping by tongues (9, 10, 13, 14) substantially perpendicular to the arms (3, 4) of the channel and by lips (7, 8) provided on these arms permitting the simple fixation of the cover on the channel.
