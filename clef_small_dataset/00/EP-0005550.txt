<ABSTRACT>
a catalyst for producing ethylene polymers in which a  first component composed of titanium, vanadium, halogen,  and or groups, wherein r is selected from among alkyl,  cycloalkyl, aryl, acyl, and combinations thereof, is combined  with an organometallic compound.  a method for producing  a catalyst system in which an organoaluminum compound  component is contacted with a component composition  produced by reacting a mixture of titanium and vanadium  compounds with an organometallic compound to form a  product mixture which is then contacted with titanium  tetrachloride.  a method for producing polymers of ethylene  by contacting ethylene with a catalyst system produced as  above under conditions suitable for polymerization.
