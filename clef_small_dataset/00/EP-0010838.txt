<ABSTRACT>
polyurethane elastomers are cured with 1,2-bis-(2-足 aminophenylthio)ethane.  the polyurethane prepolymer em足 ployed is one which has been prepared using tolylene di足 isocyanate as the sole isocyanate and, prior to reaction  with the diamine curing agent, the content of unreacted  uncombined monmeric tolylene diisocyanate in the pre足 polymer is adjusted to be within the range 0. 7 to 3. 0% by  weight.  the cured product exhibits improved mechanical  properties.
