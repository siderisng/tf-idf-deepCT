<ABSTRACT>
this invention involves a process for fabricating nickel  electrodes for alkaline batteries by electrolytically impregnat­ ing porous plaques using a counter electrode covered with a  cobalt compound, as well as the steps of preparing such a  counterelectrode for use in this process.  this process is highly  efficient because less hydrogen ions are liberated during the  impregnation process and less buffering substance, e. g. , alk­ ali metal nitrite, is needed to stabilize the ph of the solution.
