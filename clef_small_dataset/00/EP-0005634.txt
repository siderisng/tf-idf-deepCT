<ABSTRACT>
a safety device for mechanically-operated apparatus,  such as a flywheel-driven punch press, consists of a  hook-providing coupling member (34,36) for mounting on  the press crank shaft (22), and a cooperating coupling  member (38,40) for connection to the apparatus body via a  power-absorbing member (52-60).  the coupling members  (36,40) rest in the coupled position and are moved momentarily  to the uncoupled position upon initiation of an  operation by the operator.  if therefore the movable member  (20) of the press continues to move after the normal  termination of the cycle the coupled members (36, 40)  connect the movable member (20) to the power-absorbing  member (52-60) so that the movable member (20) is brought  to a stop before the press die parts can close.  the power-absorbing  member (52-60) preferably is a hydraulic piston  (54) and cylinder (52) device connected between one coupling  member and the press body, the liquid in the cylinder  interior becoming pressurised and discharging via a pre-set  relief valve or calibrated orifice (58,60) when the device is  operative.
