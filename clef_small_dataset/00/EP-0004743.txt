<ABSTRACT>
a removable closure for a pressure container (2) having  an opening (6) with a peripheral bead (7) into which there is  inserted a threaded neck member (9), the neck member  being formed of a resilient plastics material adapted to  expand and contract and having an interlocking engagement  with the bead.  the neck (9) is provided with a radially  extending handle portion (17) by means of which the  container (2) is adapted to be carried and which also serves  to prevent rotation of the neck member (9) upon the  application and threading of a cap (25) to the neck member  (9), the cap having a plug portion (36) which enters into the  opening (43) in the neck member (9) and, being tapered,  wedges into the neck member (9) and spreads the portion of  the neck member which is in radial alignment with the bead  portion, thus tightly forcing such portion against the bead to  provide a high pressure seal.  the plug portion (36) is  provided with pressure relief grooves (52) at its inner end  (54) extending axially of the plug such that as the cap (25) is  being unscrewed from the neck portion (9), the grooves (52)  are positioned to communicate the interior of the container  (2) with a space (43) between the interior of the neck and the  plug outwardly of the interlocking portion so that the excess  pressure can bleed off to the atmosphere about the threads.   the invention also comprises novel pilfer-proof mechanism  (60, 70) which has to be broken away from the cap (25) in  order to unscrew the cap and therefore readily is indicative of  tampering.
