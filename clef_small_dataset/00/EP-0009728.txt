<ABSTRACT>
hemostatic and platelet increasing agent composition  comprising α,β-diaminopropionic acid and derivatives  thereof represented by the formula:    wherein r₁ and r₂ each represent a hydrogen atom, an acyl  group, a benzyl group or a substituted sulfonyl group, and  pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
hemostatic and platelet increasing agent containing i, ss-diaminopropionic acid and derivatives thereof the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing as an active ingredient i -diamino- propionic acid or derivatives thereof. a process for preparing &alpha;, n-diaminopropionic acid which comprises treating 2,3-dichlorpropionic acid with ammonia was reported in 1894 (z. phvsiol. chem., vol. 19, page 314 (1984). since then several reports on the preparation thereof were made, and, in addition, an effect of inhibiting growth of microorganisms was reported with respect to its salts (merck index, 9th edition, page 391 (1941)). as a result of extensive investigations on dencichi (panax notoginseng e. h. chen) having hemostatic activity, the present inventors have found that l-n- b -oxalyl- 7, o -diaminopropionic acid contained therein is a hemostatic active ingredient and at the same time exhibits platelet-increasing activity. this compound was given a name of "dencichin" by the present inventors. that is, l-n- 2-oxalyl- 4, ss-diaminopropionic acid provides a good hemostatic activity and platelet increasing activity by the use in an extremely small dosage and does not exhibit neurotoxic side effect which would be encountered by the use of a relatively large dose. in addition, d-form of dencichin also possesses pharmaceutical activities similar to naturally occurring l-form. further, the d-form is slighter in neurotoxic activity than the l-form. it has also been found that even l-&alpha;,ss-diaminopropionic acid itself which is to be called as a parent substance of oxalyl-&alpha;, 0-diaminopropionic acid exhibits hemostatic activity as well as platelet increasing activity, which activity being comparable with those of l-n-ss-oxalyl-&alpha;,ss-diaminopropionic acid, and provides toxicity further less than that of the oxalyl derivative by about 1/5. that is, a rate of shortening bleeding time (hereafter referred to as "shortened rate") of the parent acid shows 44%, in contrast to 35% with the oxalyl form and its d-form, respectively which is a marked hemostatic activity. in addition, l-&alpha; -diaminopropionic acid shows the increase of the number of platelet by about 17% in platelet increasing activity, as compared to a control. that is, an object of the present invention is to provide a hemostatic and platelet increasing agent comprising, &alpha;,ss-diamino- propionic acid and derivatives thereof, represented by the formula: emi3.1 wherein r1 and r2 each represents a hydrogen atom, an acyl group, a benzyl group or a substituted sulfonyl group, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts. the active ingredient of the present invention can shorten bleeding time as 6 to 10 times as rapid, as compared to transamine which is known as a hemostatic agent, as stated above. in particular, compounds of the formula wherein r1 and r2 each represents acetyl, oxalyl and benzyl provide extremely marked hemostatic activity. &alpha;, diaminopropionic acid and derivatives thereof represented by the formula (i) are employed as active ingredients of hemostatic and platelet increasing agents as they are, or in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as, salts of /salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or hydrobromic acid, or organic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, etc.
