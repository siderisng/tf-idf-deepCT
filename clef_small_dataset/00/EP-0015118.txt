<ABSTRACT>
delicate equipment is mounted on a carrier vessel or  vehicle (8) by shock absorbers (3) spring biased to accurately  define a position at which the equipment is rigidly fastened to  the carrier (8).  when the carrier (8) is subjected to a shock  force exceeding the biasing of the shock absorbers (3), the  rigid connection is released to protect the equipment from  damage.  to accommodate horizontal shocks at least three parallel,  vertical shock absorbers (3) are provided and tilting of the  equipment relative to the shock absorbers (3), converts the  horizontal shocks into vertical movements in opposite direc­ tions.  to provide a simple shock absorber structure, each has  a single compression spring (16) which is compressed by an  axial force in either direction on the shock absorber (3).  the  spring (16) and a piston (14) at its upper end have clearance  within the absorber body (5) and are tiltable as a whole within  the body (5) when the spring (16) is compressed downwards.
