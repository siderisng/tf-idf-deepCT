<ABSTRACT>
an exhaust brake modulating control system is provided  for an internal combustion engine having a turbocharger (t)  and source of pressurized fluid (34).  the system includes a  double-acting piston-cylinder assembly (a) having one cylin­ der end (26a) communicating with the engine exhaust man­ ifold and an opposite end (26b) separated from the one end by  a piston head (35).  an adjustable control valve (31) is provided  having an outlet (31a) connected to the cylinder second end,  and a plurality of inlets (31b, 31e) selectively connected to the  outlet.  one inlet (31e) communicates with the pressurized  fluid source and a second inlet (31b) is vented to the atmos­ phere.  communicating with the exhaust manifold is an inlet  (16) of a hollow section (14) in which a rotor (15) is rotatably  mounted.  the hollow section (14) has an outlet (17) separated  from the inlet by the rotor.  the outlet (17) communicates with  the turbine wheel chamber of the turbocharger.  when the  rotor assumes a first selected position, substantially unre­ stricted exhaust gas flow past the rotor occurs.  when the rotor  assumes a second selected position, gas flow is substantially  blocked by the rotor.  the rotor and piston head are opera­ tively connected whereby the rotor is responsive to relative  movement of the piston head within the cylinder.  when the  control valve connects the cylinder second end to the pressur­ ized fluid source, the fluid pressure will balance a predeter­ mined gas pressure on the piston head whereby the head will  cause the rotor to assume a position that generates a pre­ determined exhaust braking effect.
