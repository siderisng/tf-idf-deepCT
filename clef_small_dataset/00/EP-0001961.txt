<ABSTRACT>
when using automatic lathes, the latter are often provided with a secondary machining station where the workpiece is machined further after the cutting.  the method according to the invention provides for the use of such automatic lathes, equipped with secondary machining stations for the machining of previously rough-machined workpieces.  according to the method, the blank is initially loaded into the secondary machining station and then into the main machining station.  the advantage obtained consists in being able to machine in a first clamped position a reference surface which serves for the clamping in the main machining position.  <image>
