<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus are disclosed for separating  paper fibres from portions of polyethylene film.  paper  laminated with polyethylene film is used in packaging, particularly  for milk and cream.  the resultant scrap material  has not been hitherto successfully separated into paper  and polyethylene, and the contamination of polyethylene  with paper renders such material useless for recycling.  in the use of the disclosed apparatus, the polyethylene  film contaminated with paper fibres is subjected to treatment  that converts the paper fibres into substantially uniform  balls which are separated by gravity by being entrained  in a stream of air with the polyethylene film pieces and impacted  against a plurality of impact surfaces and the relatively  light polyethylene film being separated from the relatively  heavier damp paper fibres by means of a cascade  of separators relying upon gravity separation of the heavier  component.  provision is made to remove the damp paper  fibre balls and recover the polyethylene film from the  apparatus.  the apparatus disclosed consists of a shredder (10)  for receiving and shredding batches of damp, paper fibre  contaminated polyethylene film portions, a blower (15)  arranged to receive the material from the shredder (10)  which consists of small pieces of polyethylene film and  balled paper fibre, and blow it into a first fluffer (17) containing  a plurality of impact surfaces (19 to 27) to effect  further separation, a first plurality of separators (29) in  cascade arranged to separate the paper fibre balls from  the polyethyline film by differential air entrainment and  gravity separation through screens (32), the balls falling  through into collection chambers (33), a further fluffer  (37) and a further plurality of separators (39) in cascade,  leading to a drier (41) and, possibly, an extruder (42) for  the separated and collected polyethylene film portions.
