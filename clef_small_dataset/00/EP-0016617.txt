<ABSTRACT>
the multilayer struaure is composed of a grafted  high-density polyethylene resin layer directly attached to a  resin layer of polyamide resin, polyester resin or a saponified  copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, or to a metal layer.   in such structures it has been difficult to provide adequate  bond strength between the layers, and delamination has  previously tended to occur under severe operating condi­ tions.  the grafted high-density polyethylene resin layer  composed of   (a) 97 to 50 parts by weight of a high-density  polyethylene resin having a density of 0. 945 to 0. 970 g/cm³  and being grafted with an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or  functional derivative thereof, with or without a high-density  polyethylene resin having a density of 0. 945 to 0. 970 g/cm³,   (b) 3 to 50 parts by weight of an ethylene/4-methyl-1-­ pentene copolymer having an ethylene content of 93 to 99. 5  mole% and a melt index at 190°c of 0. 1 to 10 g/10 min. , and   (c) 0 to 20 parts by weight of a rubbery synthetic polymer  or copolymer, the parts by weight of (a), (b) and (c) being per  100 parts by weight of resins (a) and (b) combined.  the structures of the invention find use as, for example,  packaging materials and building panels.
