<ABSTRACT>
a plastics article having a relatively large surface area  compared with its thickness is moulded by extruding into the  female mould component (60) a molten plastics material in a  thick sheet at low pressure through a nozzle (24) having a  width equal to the transverse surface dimension of the  article.  at the same time, the female mould component is  traversed beneath the nozzle at a speed which varies as a  function of the instantaneous thickness of the transverse  section of the article.  the female mould component is carried  on a conveyor (90) which is drawn by an electric motor (92)  whose speed is controlled by a punched card (106), template,  or the like.  after leaving the extrusion nozzle the female  mould component is deposited on one platen (94) of a press  (96) the other platen (98) of which carries the male mould  component (62).  the mould is closed under pressure and the  article is cured.
