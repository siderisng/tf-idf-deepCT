<ABSTRACT>
ketoses are stereoselectively reduced to sugar alcohol  mixtures by hydrogenating a ketose in the presence of a  supported copper catalyst, e. g. , copper on silica, in which  the individual copper particles have a largest dimension of  less than 100 nm (1000 a).  the preferred starting sugar is  fructose or a sugar mixture containing fructose, such as  invert sugar.  substantially more then half of the fructose in  such sugar is reduced to mannitol.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for reduction of sugars to sugar-alcohols this invention relates to a process for the reduction of sugars to sugar-alcohols. it is known that a variety of reducing agents and catalysts may be used to hydrogenate sugars to sugar alcohols but the majority are not stereo-selective. the sugar alcohols which are produced are a polyol with the same number of carbon atoms as the original sugar and all the carbon atoms having a hydroxyl group attached. during the process of reduction of a keto-sugar to a sugar alcohol the carbonyl group of the sugar is hydrogenated to a secondary alcohol group, the carbon atom of which is a chiral centre and the secondary alcohol group has r- and s- forms. in the reduction of a particular keto-sugar most reducing agents and catalysts produce equal proportions of the r and s forms by hydrogenation and thus equal amounts of the two different stereo-isomeric products result. we have now found an improved process by which the reduction may be conducted so as to produce a considerable excess of one stereo isomeric product and ideally one stereo isomeric product exclusively. this improved process also gives very high yields of the sugar alcohols relative to the sugar converted to other products when carried out at temperatures known to cause degradation and other side reactions in other hydrogenation processes. according to the present invention a process for the production of a sugar alcohol by the stereo-selective hydrogenation of a keto-sugar comprises contacting in a pressurised system containing hydrogen gas at a temperature of at least 8o0c a solution of the keto-sugar with a supported catalyst comprising finely divided metallic copper and a particulate support material. one preferred example is a catalyst consisting of individual particles of copper metal dispersed over the surface of the support material including a catalyst wherein metallic copper is dispersed throughout a porous vehicle. the term finely divided is used to denote individual particles of copper having a maximum dimension of less than 60 nm, more suitably less than 35 nm. the support material or porous vehicle is preferably an insoluble substrate i.e. a solid which is insoluble-or only sparingly soluble in the solvent which is used in the solution of the keto-sugar and which is stable under the reducing conditions used to make the catalyst. the preferred substrates are particulate solids conventionally used as catalyst support materials for example alumina, silica, kieselguhr, silica-alumina, graphite or molecular sieves and of these we especially prefer silica or kieselguhr. the surface area of a solid substrate for the copper may be for example from 5 sq m/g to 1000 sq m/g, preferably ca. 200-500 sq m/g if silica is used. the term keto-sugar is used to denote a saccharide molecule containing a single keto group including for example keto-tetroses, -pentoses and -hexoses, e.g. xylulose, fructose or sorbose and does not exclude mixtures of ketoses with aldoses, an example of such mixtures being invert sugar. the particles of the catalyst comprising copper metal may
