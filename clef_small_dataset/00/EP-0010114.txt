<ABSTRACT>
steam reforming catalysts, having good sinter and  polymer resistance are provided which comprise a group viii  metal such as nickel and alumina, have in the calcined but  unreduced precursor form, pore size distributions defined in  the following relationships:   i) at least 55% of the pore volume of pores having a pore  radius between 12 and 120 angstron units is in the  range 12 - 30 angstron units, and   ii) the ratio of the pore volume contatned in pores of 10-­ 50 å to the pore volume contained in pores of 50-300 å  is at least 5.    these catalysts are prepared by coprecipitation at tempera­ tures of not greater than 60°c wherein a solution of an alkali  precipitating agent is added to a solution of the catalytic com­ ponents.
