<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for axial transverse tomography in which a radiation source (1) emits one or more fan-shaped beams (2) obtained with the aid of a primary collimator (4, 5) against a body (3) to be investigated and the transmitted rays are then captured through a first row of secondary collimators (7) of large aperture by a plurality of detectors (8) which form a second row, characterized in that, for obtaining in certain cases an image of a section of the body (3) with increased spatial resolution between the radiation source (1) and the body (3) a removable primary grating (9) is inserted which is provided with slots (10) which each allow to pass a fine beam having a width which is smaller than the width defined by the apertures of the primary collimator and/or the secondary collimators (7) and that, for obtaining in other cases an image with increased density resolution, the removable grating (9) is taken out of the trajectory of the fan-shaped beam or beams (2).
