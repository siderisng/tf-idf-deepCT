<ABSTRACT>
1.  an electric window raising device, particularly for the doors of motor vehicles, of the type including a reduction drive mounted on a support housing (6) and of which one end of the motor armature shaft (2) constitutes a worm controlling a reduction wheel (3) made solid with a drive pinion (4) for a toothed sector (7) connected to the end of an operating arm (18) of the window and including, on the one hand, resilient fixing means which absorb the kinetic energy of the device at the moment of its arrest, and on the other hand, means for the angular limitation of the play of the end of the arm (18) situated to either side of said arm (18) on the toothed sector (7), characterized in that the toothed sector (7) includes, moulded in one piece therewith, a first rectangular frame of which the two lateral sides (12a) (13a) are resiliently deformable and which is provided with an axial locking stop (17) disposed on a resilient tongue (16) exerting a pressure on the arm (18) against the planes (12b and 13b) of two slides (12) and (13) formed on two resilient tongues (14) and (15) constituting the lateral sides (12a) and (13a) of the first frame, said stop (17) moving away resiliently upon passage of the arm (18) during its assembly until it comes into coincidence with a corresponding hole (19) formed in the arm (18) and in which it snap-engages at the same moment that the end of the arm (18) lodges in a second resiliently deformable frame of rectangular section which ensures lateral guiding and retention of the end (18a) of the arm (18) perpendicular to the plane of the toothed sector (7) and of which the resilient lateral sides constitute the means for absorbing the kinetic energy and bear upon the arm (18).
