<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for fixing a component, particularly a sink panel for a kitchen work surface, which is inserted into an installation opening and is provided with a peripheral strip (5) which dips into the installation opening (2) and has locking holes, said apparatus comprising a clamp (21) having a locking projection (22) and a tightening member (35) which is made of steel sheet, is connected to the clamp by means of a tightening screw (36) and can be gripped at the installation opening and supported at the clamp so as to slide laterally, the clamp having a screw hole (27) starting from the back (28) of the clamp, and the outer face of the clamp arm (23) which faces away from the edge (4) of the installation opening being the sliding surface for the supporting arm (37) of the tightening member, characterized in that at the edge (29) formed by the clamp back (28) and the outer surface of the clamp arm (23) which faces away from the edge (4) of the installation opening, a screw-holder (32) is formed which by means of a readily bendable cross-portion (31) can be pivoted about the cross-portion, said screw holder being provided between the cross-portion (31) and the screw (36) inserted in the screw-holder (32), with a slot (38) for the sliding support of the arm (37) of the tightening member which is to be supported, in such a manner that, after a pivoting movement of the screw holder (32), the axis of the screw (36) corresponds with the axis of the screw hole (27) and the arm (37) of the tightening member which is to be supported, comes into contact with the outer side of the clamp arm (23).
