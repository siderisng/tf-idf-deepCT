<ABSTRACT>
a light gauge (typically 0. 25 mm to 0. 50 mm) ferritic  stainless steel containing, for example 1. 2% titanium, is  nitrided in ammonia at a temperature between 816°c and  982°c, for a period of, typically, 25 minutes, converting  all the uncombined titanium to dispersed particles of ti­ tanium nitride.  at the same time, chromium in the steel is  converted to chromium nitride, but this is then decom­ posed by a denitriding treatment carried out in hydrogen  at about 1100°c for 3 hours.  the resulting steel contains  a dispersion of titanium nitride particles with an interparticle  spacing of, preferably, less than 2 microns.  in an alternative treatment, the nitriding step is not  continued for long enough to convert all the titanium to  titanium nitride, but the chromium nitride is then decom­ posed in an annealing step at below about 980°c, rather  than a denitriding step; the nitrogen released from the  chromium nitride combines with the remaining titanium  to form titanium nitride.
