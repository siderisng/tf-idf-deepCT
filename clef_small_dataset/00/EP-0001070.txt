<ABSTRACT>
a novel process for producing pyruvic acid is provided in  which process hydroxyacetone is oxidized with a molecular  oxygen-containing gas in a water-containing or aqueous solvent  in the presence of a catalyst.  the catalysts useful for the  above oxidation reaction are those which composed of either  at least one platinum group metal selected from the group  consisting of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and  rhenium, or the at least one platinum group metals admixed  with at least one elements selected from the group consisting  of silver, tellurium, tin, bismuth, lead and indium or with the  compound of the at least one element.  the resulting pyruvate  can be effectively isolated in the form of a solid by concentrating  the reaction solution and adding the concentrate to isopropyl  alcohol.
