<ABSTRACT>
apparatus and method for making loop chenille type  yarns comprising elongated spindle having a tapered needle  surfce (32) at one end thereof, the spindle (30) having a pas­ sage therein in communication with the needle surface for  feeding a core thread (48) to the needle surface.  effect thread  (60) is overfed to the needle location where nose piece  member cooperating with the needle aids in wrapping the  effect thread about the needle to form loops.  the binder yarn  (68) is fed to the needle (32a) and twisted about the core and  effect threads (60).  in a preferred embodiment, means (94,  86, 90, 88) are provided for reciprocating the nose piece rela­ tive to the needle between effect thread loop forming and  effect thread non-loop forming dispositions.  in this manner,  "thick" and "thin" novelty yarns are provided in which the  thick sections of the yarn comprise looped effect  threads whereas the loops are not provided in the thin yarn  sections.  means may also be provided for twisting the effect  thread about the binder and core threads.  further, by utiliza­ tion of a novel lateral feed of the effect thread with respect to  the needle surface, the effect thread is not twisted about the  core thread, but rather is disposed in side by side adjacent  relationship to the core with the binder being twisted about  the core and effect thread.
