<ABSTRACT>
an electrophotographic copying machine (1) having a  transfer sheet supply roller (33), which makes intermittent  contact with the uppermost or lowermost sheet of a transfer  sheet supply (34) and is driven before said contact by main  motor of machine.  the transfer sheet supplied by the supply  roller (33) is brought into a temporary waiting condition by  means of a stopper (37) on the carrying means for the sheet to  ensure that the sheet will overlap exactly on the area of the  toner image on a photosensitive element(d).  a copy board (6)  is supported by a supporting mechanism provided at one side  of the copy board related thereto as viewed in direction of its  movement so as to permit reciprocating movement in the  machine.  the stopper (37) is controlled so that, when the  position of the copy board (6) is detected, it is retracted from  the passage of the transfer sheet to allow it to move forward.
