<ABSTRACT>
in an electrical power distribution system, a consumer  has a control unit (42) comprising a plurality of solid state  switches (43) in supply leads (44) to a plurality of sepa­ rate load circuits, a microprocessor (41) responsive to the  magnitude of the total current drawn by the consumer  from the supply and arranged to control the various swit­ ches (43) so as to limit the total current or power in ac­ cordance with a priority program set into the microproces­ sor.  the consumer can thus control the manner of use of  the supplied power within a maximum demand limit.  this  overall maximum demand limit may be predetermined in  accordance with an agreed supply tariff or may be remotely  controlled by the utility.  preferably two microprocessors  (17, 41) with associated control switches (19, 43) are  employed, one (17) being controlled by the utility and  being associated with or forming part of the energy con­ sumption metering unit (17, 29) and serving to limit the  maximum demand and the other (41) being programmed  by the consumer to control priority of supplies to individual  load circuits (44).
