<ABSTRACT>
1.  narrow belt grinder comprising a frame (1), a horizontal table (2) connected to the frame (1) and adjustable in height, for receiving pieces (b) to be ground, two drums (20, 21), two supports (24, 25) connected to the frame (1) and supporting these drums (20, 21) in rotation, one of the supports (24, 25) comprising a drive motor (23), an endless abrasive belt (22) stretched between these drums (20, 21) and disposed above the table, and a pressure beam (40) connected to the frame (1) and arranged for its lower surface to press on the lower side of the belt, characterized in that the drum supports (24, 25) are connected to the frame (1) so as to allow the drums (20, 21) and therefore the abrasive belt (22), to make a movement of oscillation transverse with respect to the direction of displacement of the abrasive belt (22), and the transverse section of the lower surface of the pressure beam (40) is in the form of an arc of circle centred on the axis of oscillation.
