<ABSTRACT>
a method of making a thin film photovoltaic cell having a  pair (11, 12; or 31,32) of semiconductors located between a  transparent electrical contact (10 or 34b) and an opaque elec­ trical contact (14 or 35); and such a cell (1,1a,1b or 1c) itself.  in order to avoid electrical path failures, at least one block­ ing layer (16,17,19,20,36 or37) is disposed in the cell in such  a way that undesired electrical contact is prevented between  the transparent and opaque electrical contacts, as well as  between one of the electrical contacts and the semiconductor  which is remote from it.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in or relating to thin film photovoltaic ells this invention relates to methods of making thin film photovoltaic cells and to such cells them#selves. a photovoltaic cell, often referred to as a solar cell, is a sem-iconductor junction device which converts light energy into electrical energy. a typical photovoltaic cell is e layered structure comprising five principal layers: (1) an absorber-generator, (2) a collector-converter, (3) a transparent electrical contact, (4) an opaque electrical contact and (5) an encapsulant. women light is shown through the transparent contact onto the absorber-generator, the device generates between the two contacts a voltage differen tial and a current. the absorber-generator (commonly referred to as "absorber") is a layer of semiconductor material which absor±-## light photons and, as a conseguence, generates minority c-rr" ers. typically atoms of the absorber absorb photons and e c-# electrons thus creating pairs of negatively charged carriers (electrons) and positively charged carriers (#holes"). if the absorber is a p-type semiconductor, the electrons are minority carriers; if it is n-type, the holes are minority carriers. as minority carriers are readily annihilated in the absorber by recombination with the plentiful majority carriers, they must be transported to a region wherein they are majority carriers before they can be utilized to provide power for an electrical circuit. the collector-converter (the "collector") is a layer of material in electrical contact with the absorber wherein the majority carriers are of the same conductivity type as the minority carriers generated in thea@sor@er . this layer "collects" minority carriers from the absorber and "convert" them into majority carriers. if the collector is an opposite- ly doped region of the same semiconductor as the absorber, the photovoltaic device is a p-n junction or homojunction device. if the collector is comprised of g different semiconductor, the device is a heterojunction; and, if the collector is metal, the device is a schottky junction. the transparent contact is a conductive electrical contact which permits light to pass through to the absorber. it is typically either a continuous transparent sheet of conductive material or an open grid of opaque conductive material. if the transparent contact is on the same side of the photovoltaic device as the absorber, the device is referred to as being in the front wall configuration. if the transparent contact is on the opposite side, the device is said to be in the back wall configuration although scientists have known the photovoltaic effect for more than a century, it is only within the past twenty-five years that it could be considered a practical means for generating electricity in useful amounts. prior tp 1950, photovoltaic devices were limited in use to bighly specialized applications, such as light metering, wherein conversion efficiency was immaterial and electrical current demand was minimal. the advent of silicon junction technology in the 1950's permitted the development of high cost, high conversion efficiency silicon junction photovoltaic cells. arrays of such devices have been used with considerable success in the space program where cost is of little
