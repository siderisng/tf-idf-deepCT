<ABSTRACT>
an air driven dental scaler with water delivery has,  longitudinally within casing (12, 51), a water transport  tube (103) coaxially within a vibratable hollow shaft (38).   at one end a resilient support assembly (110) provides a  water seal between shaft (38) and tube (103).  assembly  (110) is positioned forwardly of a vibrational node of a  standing wave created during operation of the scaler.  an  axial force exerted on the assembly (110) during vibra­ tion of the shaft (38) improves the seal between shaft (38)  and tube (103).  a work tool assembly (20) is attached to  the vibratable shaft (38).  a water tube extends through  the assembly to where scaling tool (26) is attached.  this  independent fluid path permits the use of different steels  for the tool (26) and the water tube.  water is supplied to  the tool (26) and atomized by its vibratory movement.  the  seal (110) at one end, together with a coupling (101) at  the other end, may provide detachable support for the tu­ be (103).

<DESCRIPTION>
vibratory device, work tool assembly, and dental scaler incorporating them power driven dental scalers are well known. of particular interest herein is a dental scaler having a vibratable scaling work tool for removing calculus, stain or plaque from teeth, which dental scaler utilizes a stream of water to aid in scaling efficiency and in removal of accumulated debris. of the power driven dental scalers currently available, most common are scalers utilizing a flow of compressed air or a solid-state ultrasonic transducer to cause a scraping type work tool to vibrate. typical of the earlier air-driven dental scalers are those of u.s. patents no. 3,082,529 and no. 3,444,622 to mills et al, which scalers utilize an air-driven ball contained in a chamber. movement of the bali against the walls of the chamber imparts vibration to the chamber, which vibrations are then transmitted to the scraping tool. a more recent type of air-driven scaler, described in u.s. patent no. 3,526,962 to fuerst, utilizes a rotatable mandrel which has an irregularly-shaped tip engaged with a reciprocable block in which the mandrel tip is received. it is characteristically a problem of these air driven scalers that much of the vibrational energy generated by the vibrator motor is transferred to the handle portion of the dental scaler rather than to the scraper work tool. moreover, the modes of vibration of these scalers may change as moving parts of the vibration generating mechanism wear with time. in u.s. patent no. 3,703,037 to robinson, there is described a dental scaler which utilizes a solid state ultrasonic transducer to provide constant modes of vibration for coupling with particular types of work tools. one disadvantage of the ultrasonic scaler, however, is the cost of the transducer and its fairly sophisticated ultrasonic generator. a different air-driven dental scaler is disclosed in u.s. patent reissue no. 29,687 to sertich. this dental scaler has very few moving parts as compared to the aforementioned mechanically complicated air-driven scalers and provides efficient transfer of vibrational energy to a scraping-type work tool with relatively little vibration being transferred to the handle portion of the instrument. moreover, this type of scaler provides uniform modes of constant vibration which may be matched with the vibratory modes of various types of work tools without the need for complicated electronic components. it has been found that a flow of water over a tooth surface can provide increased scaling efficiency and patient comfort by lubricating and cooling the tooth surface and by flushing scaled debris and blood from the surface and area being cleaned. a work tool having a fluid path therethrough is described in u.s. patent no. 3,368,280 to friedman et a3. the fluid path consists of a narrow bore in the shank of the work tool itself or bore in the wall of the work tool connector designed to direct the fluid flow over the dog leg of the work tool to impinge on the tip. a disadvantage of the friedman device is that it is extremely difficult
