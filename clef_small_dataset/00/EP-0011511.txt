<ABSTRACT>
a method is disclosed in which curly or kinky human  hair is permanetly relaxed into a relatively smooth, s-curved  condition by a sequence of treatments involving first the  application thereto of a non-injurious curl-relaxing composi­ tion containing a weakly-acidic aqueous solution of a salt of a  weak acid so as to disrupt internal bonds of the hair, heating  the hair while maintaining its water-content unchanged and  manipulating and straightening the hair, then rinsing out the  hair to remove the first composition and replacing it with a  weakly-alkaline fixative composition so as to reconstruct or  modify the structure of the hair, again rinsing out the hair  and finally applying to it a resinous stabilizing composition  which also acts to set and condition the hair.  also disclosed  for use in the method are relaxing, fixative and stabilizing  compositions, as well as a package containing all such com­ positions arranged for use in sequence, possibly with a  water-impermeable cap for use in conjunction with the curl-­ relaxing composition during the heat-treatment.
