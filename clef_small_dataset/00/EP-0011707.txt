description lithium dicyclopentadienyl titanium hydride compositions and use thereof as c talysts background of the invention 1. field of igetio this invention relates to novel lithium dicyclopentadienyl titanium hydride compositions, useful as catalysts especially in the dimerization of ethylene to l-butene and in the polymerization of acetylene; and to processes for their synthesis. 2. brief description of the background of the invention including prior art cyclopentadienyl titanium complexes and nitrogen adduct complexes thereof are described in the following references: usp 3,776,932 (1973), re 29,368 (1977), usp 4,024,169 (1977), and j. amber. chem'.'soc., 98, 8072-8078 (1976), by guido pez (said patents being assigned to allied chemical corp.), hereby incorporated by reference. per the references, these complexes are capable of converting ethylene to mixtures of ethane, butane, l-butene and 1,3-butadiene. in a literature article of s.l. hsu et al. (j. chem. phys. 69 106-111 of july, 1978) use is described of such titanium complexes, in hexane solution, for polymerization of acetylene by contacting acetylene gas with this solution. summary of the inventibn we have found a new class of organotitanium compositions, namely, lithium dicyclopentadienyl titanium hydrides, which can be conveniently prepared, and are effective in particular as catalysts of dimerization of ethylene to l-butene, and of polymerization of acetylene. in accordance with this invention, there is provided an organotitanium composition characterized by the formula: lirr'tih, wherein r and r' are cyclopentadienyl rings of the empirical formula, c5hs, or are such rings wherein one or more of the ring hydrogens is substituted with a substituent inert toward lithium metal, said rings being bonded to titanium by sigma-bonds, pi-bonds and/or mixtures thereof, and said composition exhibiting a c nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum in deuterated benzene, in which observed values for the chemical shifts of the ring carbons in r are different from the observed values for ring carbons in r', and said composition exhibiting an infrared spectrum in deuterated n-hexadecane in which a titanium metalhydride absorption band is observed in the region of about 1250-1450 cm also provided is a process for producing the subject compositions characterized by contacting metallic lithium with a dititanium complex of the formula: emi2.1 wherein the ( -r) radicals are cyclopentadienyl rings, bonded to titanium through five carbon atoms each having the emperical formula, c5h5, or are such rings wherein one or more of the ring hydrogens is substituted with a substituent inert toward lithium metal, and wherein the 15 (nl: :n5-r') radical is a cyclopentadienyl ring, bonded to 1 5 titanium by a mixture of nl and n5 bonds, and having the empirical formula, c5h4, or is such ring wherein one or more of the ring hydrogens is substituted with a substituent inert toward lithium metal; in an inert solvent there for and in the presence of a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon solubilizing agent for lithium, soluble in said solvent; and at a temperature of about -10 to +600c, in the absence of elemental oxygen and water; and with initial molar ratio of metallic lithium to said dititanium complex
