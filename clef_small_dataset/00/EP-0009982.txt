<DESCRIPTION>
description "an aqueous polymer dlspersion composition useful as a giazin coat for papeeni". the present invention relates to an aqueous polymer dispersion composition useful as a glazing coat for papers comprising an aqueous acrylic polymer dispersion containing nitrocellulose and having excellent blocking resistance and gloss. for glazing treatment or printed papers, a glazing varnish in the form of a solution containing a resin and an organic solvent has been used heretofore. as the resin, a vinyl chloride resin has exclusively been used. however, the vinyl chloride resin has demerits in that surface gloss and strength of the finished surface are insufficient due to softness thereof and blocking is easily caused. other demerits are that the organic solvent used harms the health of workers and that there is a risk of fire. under circumstances as above, the utilization of said varnish is now limited for the prevention of environmental pollution. other techniques of the glazing treatment are press working and lamination working. however, they have a demerit of inviting an increase in the number of steps, though efficiencies are increased. lacquers containing nitrocellulose as a base have been used so as to improve abrasion resistance and to impart gloss and blocking resistance. however, those lacquers are also unfavourable, since they are harmful due to solvents contained therein as described above. recently, glazing treatment of paper with an aqueous dispersion of acrylic polymers containing methyl methacrylate and styrene as principal components has been effected extensively. however, this technique has problems with the film-forming property of the dispersion and blocking caused at a high temperature and a high humidity. after intensive investigations for the purpose of developing an aqueous polymer dispersion as a glazing coat for papers having excellent gloss and surface properties such as blocking resistance, the inventors have found that an aqueous polymer dispersion composition obtained by dispersing a vinyl monomer in which nitrocellulose has been dissolved and thereafter polymerizing the monomer does not cause environmental pollution and that a coating film obtained by applying the composition to a paper and drying the same has excellent physical properties (which could not be attained by using conventional aqueous dispersions) such as blocking resistance and also a high adhesion to the paper and an excellent gloss. the present invention has been attained on the basis of this finding. the present invention relates to an aqueous polymer dispersion composition useful ás a-glazing¯coat for papers in which 100 parts by weight of the polymer comprise 3-35 parts by weight of nitrocellulose and 97-65 parts by weight of a vinyl polymer in which nitrocellulose is soluble or with which nitrocellulose is compatible irrespective of the state (monomer or polymer) of the vinyl polymer and which vinyl polymer satisfies the following two formulae for second-order transition temnerature (2 emi2.1 wherein no represents parts by weight of nitrocellulose and p represents parts by weight of the vinyl polymer; said composition being obtained by adding a filmforming assistant to an aqueous polymer dispersion formed by dissolving nitrocellulose in said
