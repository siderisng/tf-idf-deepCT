<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for selectably retrieving infor­ mation from any of a plurality of spirally-formed information  tracks formed in a video disc (10) by means of controlling a  carriage (24) for translating the video disc in a forward or a  reverse direction relative to radiant beam information recov­ ery means (14) in a video disc player.  each information track is  identified by a unique address and means are provided for  selecting the address of a particular track to be retrieved.  a  prescribed sequence of drive signals is applied to a carriage  motor (28) dependent on the distance to be travelled by the  carriage to retrieve the selected information, the drive signals  being successively stepped downward to intermittently rede­ termine carriage motor speed as predetermined location  thresholds are reached during carriage translation.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for information retrieval from an optically readable storage medium background of the invention videodisc players and the like are known for recovering information that has been stored, for instance, as a succession of light reflective and non-reflective regions along spirally-formed information tracks in a disc-shaped record carrier. the record carrier can be rotated at a relatively high rate, while an optical system is employed for directing a radiant beam, such as a laser beam, to impinge upon the information tracks and for gathering a reflected beam that has been modulated by the reflective and non-reflective regions of the information track. such a player includes a carriage for translating the videodisc relative to the radiant beam at a rate equal to the pitch of the spirally-recorded tracks and beam steering means for manipulating the radiant beam to precisely follow the path defined by such tracks. a frequency modulated electrical signal is recovered from the reflected, light modulated beam and is applied to appropriate signal processing circuitry for deriving a video signal for display on a video monitor. various control signals that are utilized to operate the player are also derived from the reflected beam. heretofore, the capability has existed of displaying a selected frame of video information by prescribing the address of the frame or information track wherein it is stored, and causing the carriage to translate in a rapid manner to the vicinity of such information track. the address information has been specially encoded in both of the vertical blanking intervals present in each revolution of an information track comprising the two standard fields of a video frame. more particularly, in order to reach the selected frame or information track, the carriage has been translated at a uniform rate, greater than the normal play speed of the player, towards such information track. during the course of translating the carriage, track addresses of at least some of the tracks crossed were detected, although it is obviously not possible to detect every track address in such a mode of operation. as soon as it was detected that the selected information track had been reached or crossed, the drive signal to the carriage was terminated invariably, however, the carriage travelled past the location of the selected track and it was at least necessary to drive the carriage once in the opposite direction to return to it. by this prior technique, it was determined to always approach the selected information track from one direction when preparing to actually stop the carriage at the track. in other words, if the carriage were driven initially in the normal forward direction for retrieval, after overshooting the selected track the carriage would be driven in the reverse direction past the selected track again. upon passing the track, the reverse drive signal would be terminated and the carriage would again overshoot. finally, the normal play mode of the videodisc player would be utilized to simply play into and stop at the selected information track. if the

 claims 1. apparatus for selectively retrieving information stored in a plurality of information tracks on an information storage medium (10) in a retrieval mode of operation, including a reader (18) arranged to cause a beam of radiation (16) to scan along an information track to recover the information on the track, means (56) for indicating a target track from which information is to be recovered, a monitor (52) of the distance separating the beam of radiation and the target track, a motor (28) arranged to provide relative movement between the information storage medium and the beam of radiation transversely of the tracks in a search mode, and control means (60) responsive to the monitor for controlling the motor to decrease the distance separating the beam of radiation and the target track at a rate which depends upon the monitored distance.   2. apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the control means is arranged to stop the motor or to cause it to run at a low retrieval speed, when the target track is being scanned by the beam of radiation.   3. apparatus as claimed in either of the preceding claims including means defining certain threshold distances and in which the control means is arranged to reduce the speed of the motor in steps as the distance separating the beam of radiation and the target track reduces beyond the various threshold distances.     4. apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims including a tracking arrangement (14) arranged to cause the beam of radiation to be correctly located in relation to an information track-being scanned in the retrieval mode of operation, means for disabling the tracking arrangement during the search mode and for re-enabling the tracking arrangement in response to the distance separating the beam of radiation and the target track, decreasing below a selected threshold distance.   5. apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims arranged to read information stored in a plurality of information tracks, which extend as a continuous spiral in a disc shaped storage medium or which extend in concentric circles on a disc shaped storage medium, or which extend side by side as parallel straight lines.   6. apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims including an arrangement for extracting from the recovered information from a track address information carried on, and identifying a track being scanned, and a comparator arranged to determine the distance separating the beam of radiation from the target track in dependence on the difference between the extracted identifying indicia and the indication of the target track.     7. apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the control means is arranged during the retrieval mode of operation to cause the motor to provide movement corresponding to the spacing between adjacent tracks. and is arranged to set that rate automatically when the target track is being scanned.   8. apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the monitor includes a counter of information tracks crossed by the beam of radiation as an indication of the separating distance.   9. apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the reader is an optical reader arranged to project a beam of light to scan the information tracks.    10. a method of selectively retrieving information stored in a plurality of information tracks on an information storage medium (10) in a retrieval mode of operation by using a beam of radiation   (    to scan along an information track, in which method in a search mode of operation a target track is identified from which information is to be recovered in the retrieval mode, the distance separating the beam of radiation from the target track is monitored, and relative movement between the information storage medium and the beam of radiation is controlled in response to the monitored  distance so that the distance separating the beam of radiation and the target track is reduced at a rate which depends upon the monitored distance.
