<ABSTRACT>
a removable extension for thimbles used in bag-house  installations.  the extension (52), which projects below the  main body (46) of the thimble (42), insures that gas entering  a filter bag connected to the thimble will have a flow  direction aligned with the bag axis such that particulate  matter entrained within the gas stream will not impinge on  the sides of the filter bag and cause excessive wear.  the  extension (52), which need not be secured to the main body a  of the thimble (42), abuts the inner wall surface of the  thimble and rests on an annular flange (54) formed in the  upper portion of the thimble.
