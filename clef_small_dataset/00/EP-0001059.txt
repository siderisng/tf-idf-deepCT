<ABSTRACT>
1.  high voltage power switch comprising a main switching point (1) and an auxiliary switching point (5) which, on disconnection, opens after the main switching point (1), is connected in series with a current limiting resistor (11), has an energy storing device (25) which can be loaded from the actuator (14) of the main switching point (1) and is provided with a latching device (22, 23, 27) which automatically snaps into position when the energy storing means (25) is in the loaded state and on disconnection can be unlocked in dependence upon the position of the movable switching element (2) of the main switching point (1), characterised in that the main switching point (1) and the auxiliary switching point (5) have a common drive shaft (14) which is connected to the auxiliary switching position (5) by a slip coupling (17, 20, 21, 22), and that a lever (23) pivotally engages the movable switching element (6) of the auxiliary switching point (5) and is pivotably connected to a crank arm (22) which can be pivoted by the slip coupling (17, 20, 21, 22), and that the lever (23) and the crank arm (22) can be applied against a stationary stop means (30) in the connected position of the auxiliary switching position (5) with their common hinge (27) in the upper dead centre position.
