<ABSTRACT>
1.  cable-coupling for the through-connection of two electric cables having the same number of conductors, this coupling consisting of a casing, containing contact sockets (4, 5) and of a plug, possessing plug-pins (15, 16), this plug having an accurate fitting shape, and the joints, in the casing and plug, between the cores of the conductors and the contacts, being surrounded in each case, in a leak-proof manner, by a solid protecting body (9, 11), made of an insulating material which can be securely welded to the cables and is injection-moulded around the joints, in which coupling the plug possesses an annular component for effecting sealing in the region of the fitting shape, and in which means for avoiding unintentional separation of the plug and casing are provided, characterized by the combination of the following features : a) the casing possesses a top-shaped widened portion (10) for receiving the plug, which is extended into the shape of a connecting piece (19) ; b) the annular component for effecting sealing is designed as an 0-ring (20) is fitted in the region of the connecting piece (19) ; c) the plug is equipped, in the region of the connecting piece (19), with at least two catches (21, 22), which are mutually displaced, on the periphery, by 180 degrees ; d) the casing possesses, in the region of the widened portion (10), recesses (23, 24) for receiving the catches (21, 22) of the plug ; e) in at least one of the parts of the coupling, casing or plug, shrinkdown plastic tubes (26, 27) are fitted on to the cores (7, 8, 17, 18), and are bonded to their surfaces after their having been stripped of insulation over a greater length than is necessary for the connection to the contacts ; f) before the protecting body (9, 11) is injection-moulded, secure bonding to the latter is assured by applying an adhesion-promoter to the surfaces of the shrinkdown plastic tubes (26, 27) and of the conductors (2, 3, 13, 14).
