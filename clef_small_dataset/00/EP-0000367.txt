<ABSTRACT>
in the case of a chromium-plated or nickel-plated safety hook, the mouth 11 of the hook can be closed by means of a spring-loaded slide 3 guided on the shank of the hook body 1.  a circular eye 2 is held in a rotatable manner in the hook body 1, at the rear end of the latter.    for simplifying the production of the safety hook, its body is divided into mirror-image symmetrical body halves 1a, 1b, parallel to the plane of the hook, which are produced in an advantageous manner and can be connected to one another by welded or riveted connections after insertion of the closing parts 3, 4.  both the closing slide 3 and a connection bolt 21, 22 of the circular eye 2 are held between the mutually connected body halves 1a, 1b.  <image>
