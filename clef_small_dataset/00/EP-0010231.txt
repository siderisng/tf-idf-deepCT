<ABSTRACT>
polyphosphazene polymers are prepared which contain  repeating units represented by the formulas:    wherein x is represented by:    wherein y is selected from the group consisting of   -  - and -  so₂- and p = 0 or 1; when p = 0, r₁ and r₂ are independently  selected from a group consisting of substituted or unsubsti­ tuted aliphatic, aryl, araryl, and alkylaryl radicals or r₁ and r₂  can form a cyclic amide containing radical wherein r₁ and r₂  taken together are selected from a group consisting of (ch₂)n  where n = 2 to 12, wherein r₃ is a lower alkyl radical or  hydrogen; and when p = 1, r₁ and r₂ taken together form a  linkage in a cyclic imide containing radical selected from a  group consisting of (ch₂)n, where n′ = 2 or 3 and    where r₃ is as defined above, r₄ is selected from the group  consisting of hydrogen, halogen and aikyl radical containing 1  to 6 carbon atoms; and p′ is 0 to 4, x′ is a substituted or  unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy, amino or mercapto substituent  group or mixtures thereof which are compatible with an  n-substituted amido substituent and are known in the state of  the art of polyphosphazene technology; and 20≦(w + y +  z)≦ 50,000 per polymer and (y + z) > 0.  the polymers of the invention can be utilized to form pro­ tective films and can also be utilized in applications such as for  molding, coatings, foams and the like.
