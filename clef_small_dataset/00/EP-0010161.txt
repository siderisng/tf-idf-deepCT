<ABSTRACT>
a vinylidene chloride polymer powder, having a second  order transition temperature of at least 50°c, is recovered  from a latex and dispersed with moderate shear in a non-­ solvent for vinylidene chloride polymers, such as a polyol  used in the preparation of polyurethane materials.  a disper­ sion of the powder and a polyol is eminently suitable for use in  the preparation of polyurethane foams to impart enhanced  flame retardancy and load-bearing properties thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
dispersible vinylidene chloride polymer powders as additives for polymers the present invention relates to vinylidene chloride polymers and, more particularly to vinylidene chloride polymers which are dispersible inorganic liquids which are non-solvents for such polymers. more particularly, this invention provides a polymer additive which can be incorporated in polymers, such as, for example, polyurethane foam materials to provide both improved flame-retardancy and enhanced load-bearing properties. the present invention provides such additives in the form of a vinylidene chloride polymer powder that can be dispersed in, for example, polyols used to prepare the polyurethane foam materials. in one aspect, the present invention provides a composition for use in the preparation of polymeric materials having enhanced physical properties comprising (a) a non-solvent for vinylidene chloride polymers and (b) a vinylidene chloride polymer powder, having a second order transition temperature of at least 500c, which is dispersible in the non-solvent. the powder employed is obtained by a method comprising the steps of (i) preparing a vinylidene chloride polymer latex by emulsion poly merizing 50 to 65 weight percent vinylidene chloride and at least one copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated comonomer, and (ii) recovering the vinylidene chloride polymer powder from the latex. the latex polymer particles, prior to recovery, have a diameter less than one micron. the invention also provides a composition wherein the method for obtaining the powder further comprises, between steps (i) and (ii), the steps of adding to the latex an effective degradation-reducing amount up to 20 weight percent, based on the weight of the latex polymer, of a sequentially polymerizable monomer mixture comprising an ethylenically unsaturated non-vinylidene chloride monomer, and polymerizing the monomer mixture. in another aspect, the invention resides in a polyurethane material prepared from such a composition, e.g., wherein the non-solvent comprises a polyol. the invention also provides a method of forming a polyurethane material by reacting a polyfunctional isocyanate with an active hydrogen-containing material, characterized by including in the reactant mixture a vinylidene chloride polymer powder obtained by the method hereinbefore described. the dispersible vinylidene chloride polymer powders of the present invention are recovered from latices which have been prepared by polymerization in an aqueous emulsion according to processes well known in the art. preferably, the polymerization is carried out by essentially continuous, carefully controlled addition of the requisite polymerization constituents (including polymerization initiator systems if desired) to the aqueous medium. it is preferred to start the polymerization by adding a small amount of monomeric material to the aqueous medium and then adding the desired polymerization initiator to form a polymeric seed latex to aid in the control of particle size. the aqueous medium in which the seed latex is formed will contain the necessary surfactants to form the emulsion and will generally be adjusted to the desired ph value, as is well known in the art. following the formation of the seed latex, the remaining amount of monomeric material is continuously added under carefully controlled conditions to the aqueous medium. in accordance with the present invention, the vinylidene
