<ABSTRACT>
The method and system concern the inlaying of a forehead image (P) evolving in front of a background in color (F), in a backcase image (A). The trichromatic domain of the bottom is inside that of the forefront image (P). detectors (41) receive the primary components of the composite image (BR) of the Foreground and Background and produce signals (αr) which controls globally (43) or separately with respect to the primary components the variable gain of amplifiers (50) receiving composite video signals (A, B) or separate primary components. Each detector comprises two variable gain amplifiers (411, 412) and an analog multiplier (42) and produces a primary gain control signal (αr) having a first, second level or intermediate level between the first and second levels when The primary component of the fore-scene image, background image or colorimetric transition domain surrounding that of the background image and surrounded by that of the forward image is detected . When the transition domain is detected, the fore-scene and backcase images are transmitted in a variable report, in order to generate an intermediate transparency effect in the image inserted between the forward images. and back scene.
