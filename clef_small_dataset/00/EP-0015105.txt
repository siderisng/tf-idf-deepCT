<ABSTRACT>
a support or cast (1) for immobilising broken limbs (3) is  disclosed.  the cast (1) is formed from an inner air permeable  layer, for example lint, and an outer rigid casing (9).  tubes (4)  with spaced apertures opening onto the inner layer are  located between the inner and outer layers.  preferably air is  pumped into the tubes (4) to pass into the inner layer and  thence out of the support (1).  such ventilation prevents disÂ­ comfort and itching.
