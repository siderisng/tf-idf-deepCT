<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to converting calcium sulfide to  calcium oxide.  particles comprising calcium sulfide are  passed (via 14) into one end of a fluidized conversion bed  (16) and discharged from the other end thereof.  the bed  of particles is fluidized by passing an oxygen-containing  gas (e. g.  air) upwardly into the bottom of the bed (16) via  a distributor (17).  the oxygen of the said gas reacts exo­ thermically to convert at least some cas to cao + so₂,  thereby raising the temperature of the particles as they  pass towards the said other end.  a reducing agent is passed  (via 18) into a region of the bed (16) adjacent to the said  other end to remove, by chemical reaction, any excess  oxygen which might otherwise convert cas to caso₄.  the  reducing agent additionally reduces temperature rises in  the said region of the bed (16) so that the particles dis­ charged therefrom are of high chemical reactivity (not  having been exposed to excessively high, de-activating  temperatures) and contain an increased proportion of cao  than they otherwise might have.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to converting calcium sulphide (cas) to calcium oxide (cao), and was made in the course of work performed under a contract with the u.s. environmental protection agency. cas is produced, inter alia, during the desulphurization of fuels and gases containing sulphur compounds which react with cao or thermal percursors thereof, such as caco3 or mixed carbonates such as dolomite (approximately mgc03cac03). in order to avoid a major disposal problem, it has been proposed to convert the cas back to cao for re-use in desulphurization. this may be done by exposing the cas to an oxygen-containing gas (e.g. air). in this specification, references to "air" include references to other oxygen-containing gases unless the context states or implies otherwise. preferably the cas-containing material is in the form of particles which are fluidized by the oxygen-containing gas. if the air rate is low relative to the rate at which cas is provided or made available for conversion, not all the cas is converted and the overall sulphur content of the particles undergoing conversion tends to increase. the cas which is converted, however, is almost wholly converted to cao, rather than cas04, and the sulphur is liberated as sulphur oxides, predominantly so2. as a result, if the particles are employed in a cyclic process in which, in the other part of the cycle, the treated particles are employed for desulphurization, there will be a build-up in the sulphur content of the circulating particles which will influence the efficacy of the particles for fixing sulphur in the desulphurizing stage. in most instances, an equilibrium will be attained at a relatively high circulating sulphur content in which the amount of sulphur fixed during desulphurization will be balanced by the amount of sulphur released as oxides in the conversion stage. if the air rate is high relative to the rate at which cas is provided or made available for conversion, an increased proportion of the cas is converted to caso4, less s02 being liberated and less cao formed, i.e. the selectivity of conversion to cao is reduced. an equilibrium sulphur content is established at a lower overall level than in the case wherein the air rate is relatively low. in both cases, the conversion temperature is influenced by the rate of input to, and removal of particles from, the conversion bed since the particles act as a heat transfer agent. the present invention provides a method of converting calcium sulphide contained in particles to calcium oxide, comprising passing the particles into a conversion bed operated at an elevated temperature, the conversion bed being fluidized by passing a-free oxygen-containing gas into the bottom thereof, and in which the particles-are passed via an entrance into a first region of the conversion bed wherein at least some of the cas is converted to cao with the liberation of at least one sulphur oxide, recovering particles of increased cao content via an exit receiving particles from a second region of the conversion bed, particles passing from the
