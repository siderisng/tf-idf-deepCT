<ABSTRACT>
1.  a fluid-flow machine in the form of a processing machine or a prime mover, having a central shaft (1) disposed perpendicular to the direction of flow and having rotating vanes (2) which are held for rotation in a carrier member (13, 5) connected to the central shaft (1) and which rotate on spindles (3), parallel to the central shaft (1) and lying on a circular path (12) the plane of which lies parallel to the direction of flow, wherein the median planes of all the vanes (2) intersect, in every position of rotation, in an axis (10) which extends through a point on the circular path of rotation (12) at which the direction of flow is tangent to the circle of rotation (12), the position of this axis of intersection (10) remaining unalteral during the rotation of the vanes (2), characterized in that a disc shaped control member (29, 31) having internal or external teeth lying eccentrically to the central shaft (1) is provided perpendicular to the central shaft (1), and parallel to the central shaft (1) are cranks (23) which are each rigidly connected, at one end, to the spindles (3) and at the other end are mounted for free rotation in the control member (29, 31), and that the teeth of the control member engage a gear wheel (26) which rotates about the central shaft (1) and which meshes a with a centrally mounted,  fixed or controllable gear wheel (34, 35), the ratio of the pitch circle of the teeth of the control member (29, 31) to the pitch circle of the fixed or controllable gear wheel (34, 35) and the ratio of the lever arm of the cranks (23) to the diameter of the pitch circle of the rotating gear wheel (26) being 1 to 1 in each case.
