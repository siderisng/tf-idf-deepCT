<ABSTRACT>
a rigid object pocket (1) for fixing on the inside of an  automobile door, comprising a parallelepiped compartment  (2) receding from its front wall and provided with a downÂ­ wardly swivelling cover (3), and pairs of inner ribs (22) for  supporting and housing small parallelepiped objects such as  musicassettes (13).  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
a rigid object pocket with musicassette compartment, for fixing to the inside of automobile doors many motor vehicles are provided with playback equipment for recorded magnetic tapes. these tapes are notably always wound on spools housed in suitable plastics cases known as musicassettes or the like. the motorist always keeps a certain number of musicassettes available in the automobile. although these musicassettes are relatively small, they have a certain bulk and also need to be preserved carefully, to prevent damaging the unprotected tape portion. for this purpose, plastics containers have been used for some time as musicassette holders, which can be fitted under the dashboard or kept separately in any part of the passenger compartment. the disadvantage of these containers is that it is difficult to find a place to fix them in the passenger compartment which is handy for the driver. when the driver is driving, he must not be excessively distracted, and needs to be able to easily find the musicassette or spool container which he requires, practically by touch. the present invention provides a relatively economical rigid pocket of moulded plastics which can be fitted to the inside of a door, possibly replacing the object pocket already present there, and which acts simultaneously as a container for musicassettes which can be inserted in order in suitable guides, and as a normal pocket or holder for various objects, which is accessible from the top. the details of the invention will be more apparent from the figures of the accompanying drawings in which: - fig. i is a partly exploded perspective view of the rigid pocket; - fig. 2 is a front view of the rigid pocket; - fig. 3 is a section on the line 111-111 of fig. 2; - fig. 4 is a side view of the rigid pocket; - fig. 5 is a section on the line v-v of fig. 2; - fig. 6 is a rear view of the right hand half of the rigid pocket; - fig. 7 is a front view of the downwardly tilting door with which the rack for the musicassettes can be opened and closed; - fig. 8 is a plan view of the tilting door; - fig. 9 is a cross-section through the door on the line ix- ix of fig. 7; - fig. 10 shows an enlarged detail of figs. 5 and 9, for the purpos of showing the engagement between the door and the rigid pocket; - fig. 11 is a partial view of the cross-section on the line xi-xi of fig. 3; - fig. 12 shows the invention fitted to an automobile door. with reference to said figures, these show a rigid object container or pocket 1 which is open at its top and back, and comprises a compartment 2 accessible from the outside for housing musicassettes. the container 1 is of plastics construction and is in a single piece. the compartment 2 comprises ribs 22 for supporting the musicassettes, which are arranged horizontally. it is

<CLAIMS>
what we claim is:   1. a rigid object pocket with musicassette compartment, consisting of a shaped thin walled casing 1 with its upper and rear sides flat and open, and comprising in the lower region of the front side a receding compartment 2 provided with a downwardly swivelling closure cover 3.   2. a rigid pocket as claimed in claim 1, wherein the receding compartment 2 is of parallelepiped shape, and comprises internally one or more sets of parallel equidistant opposing ribs 22 for inserting small parallelepiped objects such as musicassettes.   3. a rigid pocket as claimed in claim 1, wherein to the sides of the parallelepiped receding compartment 2 there are provided two interspaces 4, the outer wall of which is provided with a bore 7, the two bores provided at the interspaces being coaxial to define the swivel axis for the cover 3.    4. a rigid pocket as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cover 3 comprises two symmetrical side lugs 5 orthogonal to its plane, each being provided with an external pivot 6, the two pivots being aligned and able to be inserted resiliently into the bores in the external walls of the interspaces 4.   5. a rigid pocket as claimed in claim 1, wherein the upper edge of the cover 3 is provided with a longitudinal rounded tooth 11, and the upper edge of the receding compartment 2 comprises a groove 8 into which said rounded tooth 11 of the cover 3 is  resiliently inserted and retained.      6.      a   rigid pocket as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cover comprises a central raised portion 33 to facilitate its opening.
