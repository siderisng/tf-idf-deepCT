<ABSTRACT>
a cable entry gland which will provide an effective seal  at the end of a pressurized fibre optic cable so that the  pressurization within the cable is not lost when the cable is  removed from a repeater box consists of a housing sealed to  the outer covering of the cable.  the optical fibres extend  through the housing and out through the end wall of the  housing, suitable seals being provided between the optical  fibres and the wall.  a strain wire connects the cable to the  end wall to prevent stresses passing to the fibres.  it is  possible to replace a broken fibre without dismantling the  gland by drilling out the seal in the end wall, withdrawing the  broken fibre, threading a new fibre through the gland and  re-sealing the fibre to the wall.
