<ABSTRACT>
a projector for projecting optical signals for controlling  a missile comprises means for producing two alternately  orthogonally scanned rectangular beams (p,y) from a  single incident beam derived from a single source of laser  radiation (2) and a modulator for pulse modulating said  source at a plurality of pulse rates over first and second  ranges of frequencies corresponding to respective ones of  said two beams.  the beam producing means is formed by  two prism elements (14, 16) relatively movable with  respect to each other by a transducer (12) to cause rotation  of the beams.  a pechan prism (10) with a reversion axis  oriented at 45Â° with respect to the length of the rectangular  beam is preferred for use as the beam rotator.

<DESCRIPTION>
a projector for projecting electromagnetic control signals the present invention relates to the field of information transmission employing an electromagnetic beam projector which supplies coordinate reference information to a remote receiver. nore specifically, the present invention relates to a projector of a type comprising: means for selectively generating a beam of radiation having a generally rectangular crosssectional area; means located to receive said beam of radiation for scanning said beam over at least one predetermined path orthogonal to the length of said beam crosssection; and means located in the path of said scan beam for projecting said beam as two altcrnately scanned beams having said cross-sectional length dimensions orthogonally oriented with respect to each other. in u.s. patent no. 3,398,918 two embodiments of optical systems are proposed for guiding projectiles. in the first embodiment, four fan-shaped beams are independently modulated and projected towards a target and thereby form four optical walls of a pyramidal corridor for guiding projectiles. the size of the downrange corridor is controlled by a servo driven zoom lens arrangement. a projectile launched into this system tends to guide itself by bouncing around inside the corridor. in a second embodiment disclosed in the girault reference, a proportional guidance system provides two perpendicularly oriented beams which sweep in directions perpendicular to each other in order to direct the projectile. in the second embodiment, the two beams are derived from a single light source and optically divided, respectively modulated and projected by a controlled zoom lens type system wherein the optical elements are physically reoriented with respect to each other. an improved electromagnetic radiation beam projector which eliminates the zoom lens system of the prior art and achieves more accurate control of the beam size projected in accordance with a time function has been proposed in our european patent application no. 78300729.7. this projector is used, for instance, in a beam rider missile system, wherein the missile or projectile contains tail sensors which utilize the projected beam of radiation as a means of controlling its directional flight. by determining its relative location within the cross-section of a projected beam pattern, the missile responds by steering itself to seek the centre of the beam pattern. in order to control the flight path of a missile having a known flight profile (distance from launch versus time), it projects a matrix pattern so that the crosssectional area of information is maintained constant over the known flight profile. the projected scan pattern is formed by two alternately scanned and orthogonally oriented beams of radiation which are pulse modulated over respective predetermined ranges of pulse rates to present a plurality of mensurable pulse rates at predetermined relative coordinates, termed "bins", within the defined matrix. a first beam, having a predetermined rectangular cross-sectional area, is projected to that its length dimension is horizontal to a reference and is vertically scanned over a predetermined number of rate values within a first predetermined range of rates during its vertical scan over the predetermined angle. a second beam,
