<ABSTRACT>
fluorosubstituted benzaldehydes are condensed with  anisil and ammonium acetate to yield the corresponding  2-(fluorosubstituted phenyl)-4,5-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-imidazoles.   alternatively fluorosubstituted benzaldehydes are  condensed with anisil monoxime and ammonium acetate to  yield the corresponding 2-(fluorosubstituted phenyl)-4,5-bis  (p-methoxyphenyl)-imidazole-3-oxides which can subsequently  be reduced to yield the corresponding 2-(fluorosubstituted  phenyl)-4,5-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-imidazoles.   these imidazoles have interesting pharmacological properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to novel imidazole derivatives and to processes for their preparation, the novel compounds possess intercsting physiological properties, certain substituted imidazoles have been described in the literature and these have been prepared in a number of different ways and for varoius purposes. in davidson, weiss and jelling: j. org. chem 2, 319 (1937); brederech and theilig: chem. ber. 86, 88 (1953); bederech, gompper and hayer: chem. ber. 92, 338 (1959); lihit-e and sonnenberg: j. org. chem, 29, 1926 (1964); ogata, kawasaki and sugiura: j. org. chem. 34, 3981 (1969); 1. lettau: z chem. 11, 10 (1971) and wegner and schunack: arch. pharmaz, 307, 492 (1974) various imidazoles are prepared without any indication as to their utility. radziszewski: chem. ber. 10, 70 (1877), cook and jones: j. chem soc. 278 (1941) and others have found that a number of arylimidazoles exhibit chemiluminescence under certain conditions. this property can be utilized in certain copying techniques (e.g. xerography) and forms the basis of german patent no. 1,106,599, belgian patent no. 585,555 and french patent no. 1,351,818. certain 2,4,5-triarylimidazoles have been tested as anti-fertility agents by bhaduri and khanna: indian j chem. 4, 419 (1966). certain 2-alkyl-4,5-diarylimidazoles are describedin german offenlegungsschrift no. 2,064,520 as possessing analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic activity. one of the preferred compounds of this series, 2-isopropyl 4,5-bis(2methoxyphenyl) imidazole, has been included'in the pharmacological tests described hereinafter, from which it can be seen that this preferred compound possesses a much weaker analgesic activity than the compounds of the present invention. certain 2,4,5-trisubstituted imidazoles containing a trifluoromethyl group in one of these positions and in some cases also substituted in the l-position have been described in german offenlegungsschrift no. 2,155,558 (cf. lombardino and wieseman: j med. chem. 17, 1182 (1974)). the preferred compound of this series, 2-trifluoromethyl- 4,5-bis (p-metho,ryphenyl) imidazole, has been included in the pharmacological data hereinafter described from which it will be seen that tests indicate this preferred compound to possess a weaker analgesic activity, but a higher toxicity than the compounds of the present invention our british patent no. 1,469,532 describes and clays certain imidazoles substituted in the l-position by an acetic acid or propionic acid group or ester thereof. our investigations on animal models conventionally employed in pharmacology using such compounds show that in general, arylimidazoles substituted in the l-position by a propionic acid group are more active than the corresponding imidazole unsubstituted in the 1-position. the present invention is based on the discovery of certain 2-(fluoro-substituted phenyl)-4,5-bis (±-methoxy phenyl)-imidazoles unsubstituted in the l-position which possess substantially improved properties over the compounds disclosed in german offenlegungsschrift nos. 2,064,520 and 2,155,558 and more particularly show improved activity over l-(2-carhoxyethyl)-2-(±-fluorophenyl)-4,5-bis(±-methoxy phenyl)- imidazole, a corresponding imidazole substituted in the l-position by a propionic acid group. thus according to the present invention there are provided compounds of the formula: emi4.1 wherein one or two of the substituients r2, r , r4, r5 und r6 represent a fluorine atom while the remaining substituents are hydrogen atoms. examples of compounds according to
