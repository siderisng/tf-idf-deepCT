<ABSTRACT>
a one-step curing method for the manufacture of  neutron absorbing articles, such as plates for use in storage  racks for spent nuclear fuel, includes curing a mixture of  boron carbide particles, phenolic resin in liquid state and  phenolic resin in particulate solid form at an elevated  temperature to produce a neutron absorbing article containing  at least 6% of b¹⁰ content from the boron carbide thereof,  60 to 80% of boron carbide particles and 40 to 60% of  irreversibly cured phenolic polymer, with the proportion of  weight phenolic resin in liquid state to that of phenolic resin  in solid state being within the range of about 1:0. 5 to 1:4, the  temperature of the cure being in the range of about 130 to  200°c.  and the cure being effected over a period of about two  to twenty hours.  although the liquid resins that are preferably  employed are resols, novolaks plus curing agents are  preferred solid resins.
