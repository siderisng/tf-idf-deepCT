<ABSTRACT>
it has previously been known to construct a radar system  so that it transmits long pulses and short pulses.  the long  pulses, which may be subject to pulse compression, are used,  because of their high energy, to detect objects at long range  whilst the short pulses, because of their good resolution, are  used to detect objects at short range.  this known technique  suffers from the disadvantage of requiring an exceedingly  expensive transmitting and receiving system.  a transmitter (13) is controlled by unit (14) to produce  pulses at t.  the frequency of each pulse is changed so as to  divide it into two consecutive signals of different frequencies.   these consecutive signals are of different duration and are  used, as before, for long range and short range detection  respectively.  the receiver (19) has a local oscillator (18) whose freÂ­ quency is also changed so as to make the receiver responsive  to the long and short signals when radar returns are expected  from long and short ranges.  in an alternative embodiment two separate receivers are  used.

<DESCRIPTION>
a pulse radar system this invention relates to a pulse radar system -. which transmits long and short signals and incorporates a receiver which utilises information from the long sigrals when they have been reflected from distant objects; and from the short signals when they have been reflected from near objects. the advantage of using short and long signals in this way is that the.shortsiqnais give better resolution whilst the long signal5 have a higher energy and are therefore better for detecting objects at long ranges. one such system is described in our u.k. patent specification 1424026. this system uses pulse compression on the long signals and gives the advantage of enabling the operator, e.g. on a ship, to obtain early warning of impending hazards at say twenty or more miles and, at the same time, to observe objects in the immediate vicinity. a disadvantage of this known system is its cost; which precludes its use in at least the commercial arine radar market. this invention provides a radar system comprising transmitting means for transmitting long signals and short signals having respective different frequency characteristicw and frequency discriminating receiving means adapted to receive and distinguish between the long and short signals respectively. the "different frequency characteristics" may simply be different frequencies. however other possibilities are practicable. for example, the longer signls ould be frequencyswept to effect pulse compression. when the signals are simply of two different discrete frequencies the receiving means can of course include two separate receivers tuned to the respective frequencies so that one receiver responds to the long signals --whilst the other receiver responds to the short signals this duplication of receivers can be avoided in a preferred system where the receiving means is controlled by a timing system. the timing system makes the receiving means responsive to: the frequency of the short signal for a predetermined time period after transmission of that short signal; and to the frequency of the long signal after the said time period. in' this way the receiver is made to respond to the short signals only when they have been reflected from nearby objects; and to the long signals only when they have been reflected from distant objects. the transmitting means is preferably adapted to transmit a long signal and a short signal consecutively so as to provide a tws-freouency pulse. this can easily be effected using a multipactor magnetron which-is a type of magnetron whose frequency can readily be changed. particular embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: figure 1 is a very schematic block diagram showing a radar system constructed in accordance with the invention; figure 2 is a diagram, similar to that of figure 1, showing an alternative embodiment of the invention; and figure 3 is a pulse diagram showing the timing of signals at the positions marked a, b, t t', e and f on figure 2 with c and d on figure 1.

<CLAIMS>
   cllaims: -      1. a radar system comprising transmitting means for transmitting long signals (b) and short signals (a) having respective different frequency characteristics and characterised by frequency discriminating receiving means (5 to 12 or 17 to 21) adapted to receive and distinguish between the long and short signals respectively and to use both said long and short signals to indicate the   positions    targets from which the signals are reflected.   2. a radar system according to claim 1 characterised in that the receiving means is controlled by timing means   (14) which    makes it responsive to; a frequency associated with a said short signal for a pre-determined time period   after      transrdssion    of that short signal and to a frequency associated with the long signal after said time period, whereby the receiving means uses the long signals to indicate the positions of relatively distant targets and the short signals to indicate the positions of relatively close targets.    3. a radar system according to claim 1 characterised in that the receiving means includes two receivers (7, 11) tuned to the respective frequencies.   4. a radar system according to claim 1, 2 or 3 characterised in that the transmitting means 1 is adapted to transmit a long and a short signal consecutively so as to provide a two frequency pulse.
