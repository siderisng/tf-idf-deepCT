<ABSTRACT>
2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine are  prepared by reacting a chlorosubstituted (trichloromethyl)  pyridine in the liquid state with chlorine at temperatures of at  least about 160°c in the presence of a lewis acid type  catalyst.  the products are useful as intermediates for the  preparation of herbicides and pesticides.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for preparing 2,3,5,6-tetracrloropyridine and pentachloropyr id i ne the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine and pentachioropyridine. the chlorinated pyridine derivatives of the present invention are known compounds having been previously prepared by a number of processes. these compounds have uses, such as pesticides, and are also employed as chemical intermediates in the preparation of other highly desired herbicide or pesticide products. previous methods for preparing such compounds include those described in u.s. patent nos. 3,538,100 and 3,186,994 and the prior art noted therein. according to the '100 patent, pentachloropyridine and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine (hereinafter referred to for convenience as ',penta" and "tetra" products, respectively,) have been prepared by chlorination of liquid 2,6-dichloropyridine at temperatures of at least about 1800c and in the presence of a metallic halide catalyst. polychloropyridines, including penta and tetra products, are also produced according to the '994 patent by chlorinating a polychloro-(trichloromethyl)pyridine reactant in the liquid state at a temperature of at least 1600c, preferably under irradiation with ultraviolet light. the present invention provides a process for preparing 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine which comprises reacting chlorine with a liquid chlorosubstituted (trichloromethyl)pyridine reactant of the formula: emi2.1 wherein r1 and r3 are chloro or e the starting material, e.g., 2-chloro-, 2,3-dichloro-, 2,5-dichloro- or 2,3,5-trichloro-6 (trichloromethyl)pyridine, is contacted in the liquid state with chlorine at temperatures of at least about 1600c and at atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure in the presence of a lewis acid type catalyst. the process of the present invention is preferably conducted under anhydrous conditions, and is preferably carried out in a continuous, cyclical operation to produce the preferred product of symmetrical tetrachloropyridine. in the accompanying drawings, which are more fully referred to in the description following below: figure 1 is a diagrammatic sketch showing apparatus used in what is considered to be the best mode known for practicing the invention. figures 2 and 3 are graphs illustrating results obtained in the batchwise practice of the invention as described in example 1 - table a and example 2 - table b, respectively. figures 4 and 5 are graphs illustrating results obtainable in the practice of the invention on a recycle basis as described in example 3 and tables l and m. figure 6 is a graph which demonstrates the results of an extended recycle run and effect of tar concentration on production of desired symmetrical tetrachloropyridine. in carrying out the process of the present invention, gaseous chlorine is passed into a liquid chloro-substituted 6- (trichloromethyl )pyridine starting material at a temperature of at least about 1600c in the presence of a lewis acid type catalyst. an equimolar amount of the chlorine gas reactant is employed with from about 0.3 to about 10 excess molar proportions of chlorine per mole of starting material desirably being employed. the continuous passage of excess chlorine gas through the reaction mixture serves not only to supply a large amount of reactant but to sweep out any carbon tetrachloride or hydrogen chloride by-products. the most suitable rate at
