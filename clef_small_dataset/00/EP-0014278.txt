<DESCRIPTION>
compositions containing chloroimide fabric bllaches, their use in washing soiled fabrics, and detergent fomulations containing chloroimide precursors background of the invention field of invention this invention relates to fabric bleaches and more particularly to disodium or dipotassium chloroimidodisulfate fabric bleaches. the invention also relates to the use of such fabric bleaches in detergent formulations and washing processes. the dialkali metal chloroimidodisulfates, sometimes called dialkali metal chloroimidodisulfonates, have the formula cl#n(so3m)2 where m is sodium or potassium. detergent compositions containing a watersoluble detergent surfactant, and generally a builder which is used to sequester calcium and magnesium ions and to improve detergency levels of soaps and synthetic detergents, are widely used in oe and industrial laundriesf for cleaning fabrics. such detergent composi- tions may also contain fillers, such as sodium sulfate, and minor amounts of optical brighteners, soil antire- deposition agents perfumes and the like. although such detergent compositions effectively remove soil from fabrics, such as polyester, polyester/cotton, cotton and the like, certain stains cn the fabric caused by tea, grape juice, red wine and the like, are very difficult to remove from fabrics using conventional detergent formulations to remove such stains it is a common laundry practice to add a bleach to aid in the removal of the stains from the fabric. the most common bleaches are the peroxide-type bleaches and the hypochlorite-type bleaches, such as sodium perborate and sodium hypochlorite, respectively. however, each of these bleaches suffer from certain disadvantages. the peroxide-type bleaches usually require an activator to be effective, particularly in cold or tepid water. on the other hand, the hypochlorite bleaches can effectively remove the stains, but such stain removal is frequently accompanied by some damage to the dyed fabric. futhermore, it is often desirable, if not necessary, to segregate white clothes from colored clothes to minimize the deleterious effect of normal use levels of hypochlorite bleaches on colored fabrics. those skilled in the art of detergent formulations have long been interested in a material that is stronger than the peroxide-type bleaches and would act in cold or tepid water, but yet is not as strong as the hypochloride-type bleaches that have a deleterious effect on dyes and fabrics, and yet have a desirable bleaching property. now, a material has been found that is intermediate in strength between alkali metal hypochlorite and peroxide-type bleaches, that is sufficientyl strong to bleach most stains during washing, but is nct so strong as to cause undue damage to colored fabrics. such an improved laundry bleach permits the use of bleach with colored fabrics with reduced fear of damage to the color. moreover, the necessity for separating colored fabrics from white fabrics during the washing and bleaching operation is reduced or even eliminated summary of the invention these and other advantages are achieved by a fabric bleaching composition which comprises water and a stain-bleaching amount of a bleach selected from the group consisting of dlsodium chloroimidodisulfate, dipotassium chloroimidodlsulfate and mixtures thereof. the invention also contemplates a process of washing fabrics, such as
