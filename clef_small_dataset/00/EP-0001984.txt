<ABSTRACT>
1.  backflow preventer, especially for installation in a domestic water pipe having a backflow-preventing valve (22, 23, 10), which is arranged between a fresh water inlet pipe support (2) and a fresh water outlet pipe support (3), as well as with an outlet valve (27) for waste water arranged between the fresh water outlet support (3) and an outlet opening (35) for waste water, so that one of the two valves lies behind the other and they both have a common valve member (10) which is slidable in the axial direction, is impinged upon axially by inflowing water in the direction of opening of the backflow preventing valve (22, 23, 10) against the action of a spring (19) and has such a length that, approximately during the opening of one valve, the other is being closed and vice-versa, and that in the region of the outlet valve as in the valve seat (28) an immersed body is formed, characterised in that the valve member (10) is also formed as an immersed cylindrical body in the region of the backflow preventing valve as in the valve seat (22) of the backflow preventing valve, which body terminates in the form of a dome, and that the outlet opening (35) communicates axially with the outlet valve (27), and the outlet support (3) is situated between the two valves in the valve housing surrounding both valves.
