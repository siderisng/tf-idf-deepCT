<ABSTRACT>
a device for storing and dispensing sheetlike materials  comprises a coilable web (23) transferrable from one reel (20)  onto another (22) and vice versa.    for the storing of the sheets (24), the latter are introduced  between adjacent convolutions of the web during the  winding-up cycle.  dispensing of the sheets occurs by  unwinding the previously coiled web (23) so that the sheets  (24) are released again.  the web (23) is driven by a rotating  feeding roller (21).  via a slip clutch (28, 29) mounted on the  reel driving shafts (20, 22), the web (23) is kept tensioned.  as such, the problems of prior art systems, which make  use of directly driven reels and which require a controlling of  the coil diameter in order to store and dispense sheets at a  uniform speed and tension, are avoided.  the system is mounted in a light tight housing (11) and  forms part of an x-ray daylight system in which it is used as  intermediate magazine for unloading radigraphic cassettes.
