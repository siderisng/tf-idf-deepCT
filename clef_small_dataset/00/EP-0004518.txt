<ABSTRACT>
1.  a metallic heat-insulation formed of a stack of alternate metal sheets (1) and cellular panels, characterized in that each of the said cellular panels is produced in a manner in itself known, by after-stretching of expanded metal after it has previously been cut out and embossed, so as to finish up with a plane structure having substantially square or rectangular cells, bounded in thickness by the two planes formed by the sheets (1) and formed of straps (2, 4 to 6) all perpendicular to these two planes, each of the cells including a first pair of sides facing one another and composed each of a double strap (2) of the same width for each of them and a second pair of sides (3) facing one another and formed each of two straps (4, 5) placed end to end and "like tiles" (figure 2), the sum of the widths of these two straps being furthermore equal to the width of the double straps (2) forming the first two sides, the said metallic cellular panel being placed in such a way that the double straps (2) are at right angles to the direction of convection (b).
