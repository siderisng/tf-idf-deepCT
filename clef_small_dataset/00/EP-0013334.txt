<ABSTRACT>
for supplying infusion solutions from several infusion bottles (1, 2, 3, 4), a shut-off valve (5, 6, 7, 8) is arranged in each admission line (9, 10, 11, 12), all the admission lines (9, 10, 11, 12) being brought together in a collecting line (14).  this collecting line (14) is connected to a pump (15) for supply to the patient.  by means of a computer (19), opening times for the individual shut-off valves (9, 10, 11, 12) are determined and switched sequentially via a control apparatus (20), so that the delivery rate is determined by the opening times and a pulsed infusion of the individual infusion solutions takes place successively from each infusion bottle (1, 2, 3, 4).  <image>
