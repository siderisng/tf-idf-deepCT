<ABSTRACT>
a scan acoustical holographic apparatus and method for  sequentially acoustically scanning the interior of an optically  opaque volume (11).  the apparatus includes an array of acoustic tranducers  (16) that are coupled to the volume for directing acoustic  signals into the volume (11) and to receive reflected acoustic  signals from the volume (11), a plurality of frequency divider  means (23) receiving high frequency clock pulses and  generating electrical pulse signals for transmission by the  transducers (16) the phases of these signals being controlled  by phase adjusting means (50) in dependence in the  distances between the transducers (16) and selected focal  points (a,b,c) within the volume (11) to effectively focus the  transducers on the focal point and mixing means (52) for  mixing the phase adjusted signals with the received signals  to effectively focus the transducers (16) during a receive  mode and to generate high amplitude holographic signals  when the receive signals are in phase with the phase altered  transmitted signals.  the resultant holographic signals can be  electronically processed to form an electronic analogue  hologram which is utilized to visually display a holographic  image of the interior of the volume (11).
