<ABSTRACT>
a process for preparing peroxide-based bleach media  and concentrated bleach compositions for use in carrying out  that process, the process comprising incorporating in an  aqueous medium a peroxide-based bleach and an activator  therefor.  in order to provide a bleach medium which is effective at  temperatures at which home laundering is conventionally  carried out the activator so incorporated is a cyanoamine and  the medium is maintained alkaline, if necessary by the incor­ poration of a buffering agent.  the cyanomaines are those of  equivalent weight 44 to 600 which have the molecular for­ mula:    , in which r₁ and r₂ represent hydrogen or group ia metal  atoms (with certain provisos) or certain hydrocarbyl, alkanoyl,  ethoxylate, or propoxylate, cyanoamino or polyalkenylamino  groups or in which r₁ and r₂ taken together with the amino  nitrogen atom to which they are attached form either (a) a4 to  6 carbon atom-containing ring in which defined substituents  may optionally be present on one or more of said carbon  atoms or (b) a heterocyclic ring of 5 to 7 atoms which contains  hetero atoms selected from o, s and n-r₃, in which r₃, can be  a hydrogen atom or certain hydrocarbyl, alkanoyl or cyano  groups or another heterocyclic ring of 5 to 7 atoms, and in  which defined substituents may optionally be present on one  or more of the heterocyclic ring carbon atoms.  the bleach and the activator can be incorporated in the  aqueous medium separately or in the form of a liquid or solid  concentrated bleach composition.
