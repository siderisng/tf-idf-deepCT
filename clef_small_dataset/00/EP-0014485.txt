<ABSTRACT>
a railway points-heater has a burner (3), the burner body  (4) of which consists of a gauze packet instead of ceramic  material, by which the heating-up time, in which the flame  burning on the outside may extinguish, has been reduced.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
burner for a railway points-heater. the invention relates to a burner for a railway points-heater comprising a burner housing and at least one burner body arranged in said housing and having passages. such a burner is known fron gernan patent specification 1,111,661. herein the burner body consists of a burner stone. in order to prevent extinction of the flame during a storm or during the passing of trains by a gust of wind, the combustion channels have such a width that the gas/air mixture passing through the combustion channels already ignites in the combustion channels. this burner stone requires a long heating-up time until it reaches such a degree of heat that ignition can take place in the burner stone. during this heating-up time the flame may be extinguished by a gust of wind. the burner stone can be rendered suitable for all kinds of gas only with difficulty. the burner stone has, in particular, the disadvantage that it can be made only with difficulty and is likely to break down due to vibrations. the invention provides a burner of the kind set worth in the preamble, in which the risk of extinction of the flame, even a short time after ignition, is avoided, and which as regards a flash-over of the flame to the gas-air mixture feed is absolutely safer even in the event of appreciable variations in the gas-to-air ratio, in the chemical composition of the gas and/or the output of delivered heat, said burner being readily manufacturable and being capable of withstanding vibrations, since the burner body mainly con sists of a gauze packet within which the combustion takes place. the gauze packet preferably comprises at least three and preferably more than three wire-nettings succeeding one another in the direction of flow. ine aforesaid and further features of the invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to a drawing. the drawing shows schewatically in fig. 1 a plan view of railway points having a points-heater provided with burners in accordance with the invention, fig. 2 an enlarged, perspective view, partly broken away, of a detail of a points-heater having burners -as shown in fig. 1, fig 3 an enlarged perspective and exploded view, partly broken away of a burner of the points-heater shown in fig. 1, figs. 4 and 5 an enlarged sectional view of a burner in operation with a rail taken on the line iv-iv and v-v respectively in fig. 2, figs 6 and 7 a front and side view respectively of detail vi of fig. 3, figs 8 and 9 a front and side view respectively of detail viii of fig. 3, figs. 10 and 11 a front and side view respectively of detail x of fig. 3, figs. 12 and 13 a front and side view respectively of detail xii of fig. 3, fig. 14 on an enlarged scale detail xiv of fig. 4, figs. 15, 16 and 17 each a variant of detail xiv, fig. 18 an enlarged sectional view
