<ABSTRACT>
1.  self-ventilating electric machine, wherein on each side of the machine the winding head (8) of the stator winding is supplied with a gaseous coolant by a ventilator which is arranged on a hollow hub (11) which is connected to the rotor (13) and which rests on the rotor (13) in particular via ribs (16) and whose inner diameter (12) is greater than the diameter in which are arranged the axial cooling channels (5) of the rotor (13), which channels (5) supply radial cooling channels (4, 3) in the stack of rotor and stator laminations (2, 1) with the coolant which is sucked in from the exterior and which having passed through the rotor passes via the air gap (6) into the radial cooling channels (3) of the stack of stator laminations (1), characterized in that the ventilator which is designed as an axial ventilator (10) is arranged behind the coolant entry openings and conveys only that coolant flow which is necessary to cool the winding head (8, 7) of the stator winding and possibly of the rotor winding and which, having passed through the winding head (8, 7) emerges into the exterior, and that the separate coolant flow which passes through the axial cooling channels (5) of the rotor is transferred to the exterior of the rear of the stator.
