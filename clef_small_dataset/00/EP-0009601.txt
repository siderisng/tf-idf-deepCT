<ABSTRACT>
A hydropneumatic suspension, in particular for motor vehicles with a charging platelet (1), consists of a gas spring forces and damping forces producing hydro pneumatic spring element (8.9) with a filled in an oil strain and loaded on a gas cushion, the pressure piston which is loaded by a gas cushion, the pressure of the gas cushion A variable load load of the spring element (8.9) is determined, and from a monitoring room from the toasting of the load-loading pressure medium oil or gas - is conveyed into the spring lement (8.9). In order to achieve the promotion of pressure medium from a monitoring room with simple means, wherein the invention is to comprise suspensions with a high pressure chamber and a low pressure chamber and also those with an exclusive high-pressure chamber, the load space is as a helical cylinder connected to the charging platelet (1) (14.15 ) with an auxiliary piston (36, 37), which is provided with brackets (fork 18,19) for a loading unit (20, 21) and automatically shifted from an extended state when the loading unit is placed.
