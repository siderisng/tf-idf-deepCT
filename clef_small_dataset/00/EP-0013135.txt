<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides an inexpensive and simple  mechanical spring system which automatically compensates  for variations in the clearance gap in the valve-actuating  mechanism of internal combustion engines, whereby considÂ­ erably to lengthen the time an engine can be in operation  before manual adjustment of the clearance gap becomes  necessary.  the system comprises at least one tin metal disc  (20) located between a convex surface (21a) in contact with  the centre of one face of the disc (20) and an annular surface  (22a) in contact with the periphery of the other face of the disc  (20), movement of the surfaces (21a, 22a) together deforming  the disc (20) around the convex surface (21a) to produce a  spring force which increases at a variable rate until it exceeds  the valve spring (14) loading and the valve (12) opens.  the  mechanism is initially adjusted so that the spring deflection is  approximately one half the deflection required to overcome  the valve spring loading.
