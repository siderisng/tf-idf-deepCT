<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to apparatus and a method for  producing a coated film in which a cooled polymeric tubular  extrudate is coated, reheated and inflated to yield an  oriented, coated tubular film.  the apparatus includes a coating head comprising a  rotatable assembly including a support member [13] providing  an orifice [14] through which the tubular extrudate may  be fed, a plurality of spreading members [19] spaced-apart  around the orifice, mounting means [15] for each of the  spreading members operatively associated with the support  member and displaceable relative thereto, and means [21]  for biasing each of the spreading members into engagement  with the tubular extrudate.  liquid coating medium is suitably deposited on the  extrudate from a spray assembly, and the coating assembly  is rotated around the extrudate thereby spreading and  polishing the deposited medium to yield a uniformly coated  film.  the system is particularly suitable for the production of  polymeric packaging films having an antistatic coating on  the surface thereof.
