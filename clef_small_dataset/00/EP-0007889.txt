<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus in large, open goods carriers.  the present invention relates to an apparatus in large  open goods carriers, so called container-flats, which display a  loading plane (1) and at least one wall unit (2, 3), for example  an end wall unit, which is fixedly retained in the loading plane  for pivotal switching from a rest position, in which the wall  unit (2, 3) is located in or parallel with the loading plane (1),  and a working position, in which the wall unit (2, 3) makes  substantially a right angle with the loading plane (1).  the problem which forms the basis of the present inven­ tion is that of obviating the inconveniences inherent in the  prior art constructions and, thereby, to realise an apparatus  whose end walls or walls are easier to manipulate between  the rest position and the working position and which are  easier to lock in the working position.  furthermore, it is desir­ able to realise as stable and reliable a hinge construction as  possible for the pivotal end walls units or walls.  this is achieved in accordance with the present invention  in that the anchorage of the wall unit (2, 3) consists of a hinge  means with a shaft in or on which one end of at least one  torsion bar (20, 21) is disposed in a non-rotary manner, the  torsion bar extending longitudinally with the pivotal shaft (18)  of the pivotal wall unit (2, 3), the other end of the torsion bar  (20, 21) being disposed in a non-rotary manner in the loading  plane (1), and that the torsion bar (20, 21) is tension-free in a  position on the wall unit (2, 3) between its rest position and  working position.
