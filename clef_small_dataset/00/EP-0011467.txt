<ABSTRACT>
a tape cassette includes an internal drive system which  is engageable by a drive capstan of a tape cassette machine  and which drives a recording tape of the cassette at a speed  which is higher or lower than the speed at which the tape  would be driven by the capstan alone.  where the tape speed  is reduced, the playing time of the cassette is increased and  the cassette is therefore less wasteful for speech recordings  where a high tape speed is not necessary.  the drive system  can comprise a drive belt (34) which is driven by the capstan  (20) and which passes around a pair of rollers (32 and 32′),  the tape being driven by means of one of the rollers (32′).   alternatively, a rotatable member (such as a roller, a tubular  sleeve or a gear) can be engaged by the capstan, and the  tape is then driven by means of the rotatable member.
