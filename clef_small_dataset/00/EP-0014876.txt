<ABSTRACT>
a portable, electrically energized surface finishing tool  for use with peripherally and planar acting finishing devices  comprises an elongated tool body (20) having a length and  distal first (37) and second (31) opposite ends.  a tool support  handle (36) is positioned adjacent the first end (37) of the tool  and a support spindle (30) which is adapted to receive a  peripherally acting surface finishing tool (48) is positioned  adjacent the second opposite end (31) of the tool.  the support  handle (36) and the spindle (30) are mutually orientated for  providing that the spindle extends horizontally and trans­ versely to the tool body length when the support handle (36) is  positioned vertically.  a guard means (62) is positioned bet­ ween the spindle and the support handle (36).  ease of use and  balance is imparted to the tool by positioning an electric drive  motor armature shaft at a location intermediate the first and  second ends (37,31) and extending from a side of the tool  opposite to the side from which the spindle (30) extends.  the  armature shaft extends transversely with respect to the length  of the tool.
