<ABSTRACT>
an optical data recording system in which a writing beam  (41), such as that generated by a laser (20), is incident on an  acousto-optic device (30) (such as a bragg cell) and may be  diffracted (deflected) at an angle determined by the frequency  of a source applied to the device.  by selecting the system  mangification between the device and a recording medium  (14) such that the magnification is substantially equal to the  ratio of the scanning velocity of the writing beam, or the  velocity of the recording medium if the writing beam itself  does not scan, to the velocity of the sound wave in the  acousto-optic device, the image of the acoustic pulse follows  the surface of the recording medium and permits imaging of  the video signal to the recording medium without blurring.
