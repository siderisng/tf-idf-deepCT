<ABSTRACT>
Method and installation for the production of calcium chloride by the action of calcium carbon hydrochloric acid, said method being characterized in that this reaction is operated in the upper part (23) of a reactor (1) sealed and delimited by a filter sieve (2), so that the pressure of the carboni gas that caused by said reaction serves as a vehicle for the propulsion of the calcium chloride solution obtained through the sieve towards theOutput (9) of said reactor.The installation being characterized in that the upper portion of the reactor (1) is delimited by a filter sieve (2) and closed in a sealed manner, so as to form a reaction chamber (23) whose base is constituted by thisSieve, the outlet orifice (9) of said reactor being arranged under the sieve.
