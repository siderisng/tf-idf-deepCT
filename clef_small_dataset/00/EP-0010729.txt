<ABSTRACT>
a pressure responsive switch, for control dependent on low pressure, contains a socket (1) in which a diaphragm (4), to be acted on by a pressure difference, is clamped, sealed at the edges, a connecting device (2) opening into the socket cavity (13) which is constrained by the socket (1) and the diaphragm (4).  arranged in the socket cavity (13) there is a snap switch (7), operated by the diaphragm (4), the connecting pieces (23) of which lead through the base (3) of the socket (1).  the diaphragm (4) is designed as a cover of the socket (1) and is unconstrained on the outside.  <image>
