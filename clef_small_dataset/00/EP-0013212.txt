<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention is to use a single metal wire (1) formatted by a so-called wire rolling operation which consists of putting the wire shaped jointly. The rolling is followed by a so-called curving operation of the yarn during which the turns at regular intervals, according to the line (00 ') of the line, using corners (C₁ and C₂) in a way that the line formed of a succession of identical groups of three turns in which the first and third turns (S₁ and S₃) have relative to the axis (00 ') of equal inclinations but of the opposite direction and in which one half of the Second Spire (S₂) remains joined with the first Spire (S₁) and the other half remains joined with the third Spire (S₃). Application to the manufacture of double helix delay lines, the "Ring and Bar" type and the "Ring and Loop" type, which are used in progressive wave tubes operating in amplifiers.
