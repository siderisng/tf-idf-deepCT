<ABSTRACT>
a flow divider valve assembly and a power assisted steering  system therewith.  a spool (1) is axially slidable in a spool  cylinder (2) within which is it biased (23, 24) to a neutral condition  in which two control ports (13, 16) are open.  a first of the  control ports (13) is in a first fluid line which extends from an  inlet port (8) by way of a first auxilliary chamber (11) to an  outlet port (15) and the second control port (16) is in a second  fluid line which extends from the inlet port (8) by way of a  second auxilliary chamber (12) to a second outlet port (18).   the outlet ports (15, 18) can be connected to opposite sides of  a power assisting ram in a steering system.
