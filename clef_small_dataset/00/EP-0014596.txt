<ABSTRACT>
a mixed metal oxide electrocatalyst comprising oxides of  at least two metals is formed by the thermal decomposition of  metal-organic compounds, together with a method of produc­ ing electrodes for electrolytic processes carrying a coating of  such an electrocatalyst and the electrodes themselves.  the  electrodes may be used either as anodes or cathodes in elec­ trolytic processes, such as the electrolysis of alkali metal  halides, electro-organic syntheses, electrowinning and water  electrolysis, in electrolytic apparatus, such as fuel cells and  metal/air batteries, and as insoluble anodes in plating pro­ cesses.

<DESCRIPTION>
electrodes having mixed metal oxide catalyst coatings pffld methods for producting sucr electrodes elled of the the this invention relates to the art of electrode catalyst coatings and, more specifically, to mixed metal oxide coatings on anodes and cathodes to be used for electrolytic processes, such as the electrolysis of alkali metal halide solutions, water electrolysis, electrawinning, the operation of fuel cells, electro-organic syntheses and the like. background of the invention electrolytic processes are utilized in the manufacture of many essential basic chemicals required in industrial societies. among these are chlorine and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). these basic chemicals are generally produced in electrolysis cells having anodes and cathodes and a brine solution electrolyte. various cell designs have been utilized, including originally flowing mercury cathode-type cells and, more recently, diaphragm- type electrolytic cells and cells having cation-exchange nedbranes. originally, graphite was used as an anode both in mercury cells and in diaphragm cells. with the introducti# of dimen sionally-stable anodes, it became common practice to utilize anodes having a valve metal substrate with an electroconductive catalytic coating, usually containing precious metals or oxides thereof, in place of the graphite formerly used. because of the ever-increasing and high cost of precious metals, the cost of operating such cells is high, both in terms of original conversion to the incorporation of diiris##ionally#t#le anodes and recoating of the anodes once the coating has deteriorated through use. throughout the history of diaphragn and membrane-type cells, it has been @@@@@@@ to utilize mild steel mesh as a cathode material, since other cathode materials are either cost-prohibitive or not yet fully coe#cialized. in recent years, interest in oxygen or air depolarized electrodes has been increasing substantially, because gas#epolarized electrodes and processes using them are highly energy-efficient. development is under way in order to utilize such electrodes in the dilor-a3kali industry. such gas-depolar- ized electrodes are generally constructed of a hydrophobic polymer material, such as polytetrafluorcet1#lene (pthe), along with an electroconductive material, such as carbon black or precious metal blacks on a porous substrate. again, as with dimensionallystable anodes, an electrocatalyst generally comprising precious metals or oxides thereof is utilized to effect the reduction of oxygen gas at the electrode-gas-electrolyte interface. only the dimensionally-stable anode has found commercial utility in industrial electrolytic processes, because the reduction in production costs offsets the substantial investment in precious metal catalysts employed therewith. a less expensive but comparably effective electrocatalyst would be of extreme value in the industry. it is knawn in the art of catalysis to employ a nickel/ cobalt oxide spinel form of catalyst. thus, g3-ps 1,461,764 describes the preparation of nickel oxide/cobalt oxide spinel catalysts by coprecipitating the metal ions upon a substrate fran the corresponding oxalates or by freeze-drying the metal nitrates in solution with liquid nitrogen and depositing them on the elec- trode substrate, prior to thermal decomposition. these processes are very complex and require the use of highly-sophisticated equipment not necessitated by the present invention. also, thermal decomposition of nitrates creates hazardous oxides of nitrogen,
