<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method of demonstrating thermal cutting processes, characterized in that by means of a cutting unit, at a rotating, circular disc-shaped workpiece, a chip is separated which unrolls from the workpiece in a spiral fashion, or a trimming cut is carried out, where at the end of one rotation of the workpiece, the cutting unit is automatically readjusted in relation to the workpiece by the width of the chip and/or the width of the cut ; and that by means of a camera, the cutting process is observed or recorded, as the case may be, where the camera is arranged ins the angular region between the edge of the workpiece and the chip or, in the case of a trimming cut, between the region of the workipiece edge, which considered in the cutting direction, lies in front of the point of cutting, and the region of the workpiece which lies behind the point of cutting, and is directed towards the point of cutting.
