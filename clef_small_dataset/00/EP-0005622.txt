<ABSTRACT>
process for decomposing water into hydrogen and  oxygen by (1) reacting hydrogen sulfide with cuprous sulfide  to produce said hydrogen and cupric sulfide according to the  equation h₂s + cu₂s → h₂+2cus; (2) decomposing said  cupric sulfide to produce said cuprous sulfide and sulfur  according to the equation 2cus → cu₂s + s; (3) reacting said  sulfur with water to produce said hydrogen sulfide and sulfur  dioxide according to the equation 3s + 2h₂o → 2h₂s + so₂;  (4) reacting said sulfur dioxide with water to produce sulfur  and sulfuric acid according to the equation 3so₂ + 2h₂o → s  + 2h₂so₄; and (5) decomposing said sulfuric acid to produce  said sulfur dioxide, water, and said oxygen according to the  equation 2h₂so₄ → 2so₂ + o₂ + 2h₂o.  this process utilizes lower temperatures and is more  thermally efficient than prior thermal processes.
