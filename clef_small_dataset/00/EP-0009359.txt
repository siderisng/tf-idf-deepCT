<ABSTRACT>
a ventilator for barns and the like, having a generally  rectangular housing (12), containing duct work, adapted to  fit through a wall or roof of the building.  the housing (12)  has an inside and an outside end and at its inside end, the  housing (12) has an intake fan (28) for drawing air in­ wardly, and an outlet fan (30) for drawing air from the  interior of the building.  at its outside end, the housing  comprises a transfer chamber (36) with air outlet openings  (48) on one side of said chamber and air intake openings  (46) on the other side of said chamber.  a two part damper  (50a, b) is movably mounted within the transfer chamber  (36), the two parts being swingable towards and away  from one another.  a linkage arrangement (60a, b) inter­ connects the two parts of the damper so that they move in  unison in opposite directions in response to operation of  a drive motor (64).  this enables the ventilator to operate  in two modes, a first mode in which it draws in fresh air and  expels stale air simultaneously and a second mode in which  it recirculates the air within the building, according to the  settings of the damper parts.  in intermediate settings both  modes of ventilation can take place at the same time.  the  two fans (28, 30) and associated motors are mounted on  a mounting frame (22) which is hingedly connected to the  housing (12) to facilitate servicing of the ventilator.
