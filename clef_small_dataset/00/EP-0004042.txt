<ABSTRACT>
1.  circuit arrangement for the production of the carrier frequencies 612, 1116, 1364 etc. to 4340 khz of the carrier frequency communications transmission system v960 from the control frequency 124 khz employing frequency multiplication, frequency division and mixing, characterized in that a first arrangement produces a first auxiliary frequency of 2604 khz and a second auxiliary frequency of 2976 khz from the control frequency by means of multiplication, and that a second arrangement (fig. ) produces all required carrier frequencies (tr) of the system by mixing, multiplying or dividing only the two auxiliary frequencies, namely the carrier frequency 612 khz from the difference of three seventh and six thirty-firsts of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz, the carrier frequency 1116 khz from the difference of the auxiliary frequency 2604 and half of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 1364 khz from the sum of one third of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and one sixth of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 1612 khz from the difference of the auxiliary 2604 khz and one third of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 1860 khz from the difference of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and one quarter of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 2108 khz from the difference of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz and one third of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz, the carrier frequency 2356 khz from the sum of one third of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and half of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 2604 khz directly from the auxiliary frequency of the same frequency, the carrier frequency 2852 khz from the sum of one third of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and two thirds of 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 3100 khz from the sum of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and one sixth of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 3348 khz from the sum of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and one quarter of the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 3596 khz from the sum of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and one third of the auxiliary frequency 2976  khz, the carrier frequency 3844 khz from the sum of one third of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz and the auxiliary frequency 2976 khz, the carrier frequency 4092 khz from the sum of 2604 khz and half of 2976 khz and the carrier frequency 4340 khz from five thirds of the auxiliary frequency 2604 khz.
