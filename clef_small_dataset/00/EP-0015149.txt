<ABSTRACT>
a sheet-like composite material comprising a micropor­ ous support layer and, supported thereon, a crosslinked,  water permeable, interfacially polymerized, ultrathin  polyamide desalinizing layer, characterised in that the  desalinizing layer comprises the interfacial condensation  reaction product of:   (a) an essentially monomeric, aromatic amine-reactive reac­ tant comprising a polyfunctional acyl halide, the amine-­ reactive acyl halide groups of the polyfunctional acyl halide  being capable of condensing with primary amine functional  groups to form amide linkages in less than 60 seconds under  normal ambient temperature and pressure; which polyfunc­ tional acyl halide has at least three of the acyl halide groups  substituted on an aromatic nucleus comprising less than 3  aromatic rings; the amine-reactive reactant being at least 0. 01  weight-% soluble in liquid aliphatic or liquid halogenated  aliphatic solvents; the aromatic nucleus being free of sub­ stituents capable of chemical interference with inter­ molecular amine-carboxylic acid, amide-forming condensa­ tion reactions; and   (b) an essentially monomeric, aromatic, polyamine reactant  having at least two primary-amine substituents substituted  on an aromatic nucleus comprising less than 3 aromatic rings;  the primary amine functionality of the said aromatic  polyamine reactant being no more than the carboxylic acid  equivalent functionality of said polyfunctional acyl halide; the  aromatic polyamine reactant having a solubility in water of at  least 0. 01% by weight and being free of substituents capable  of chemical interference with intermolecular amine/carbox­ ylic acid, amide-forming condensation reactions;   the polyamide layer having a lower elongation than the  corresponding linear polymer; a molecular weight in excess  of 100,000; a crosslink density of at least 1 per 100,000; a  solubility in liquid organic amide, sulphoxide, and pyr­ rolidone solvents or solvent blends which is less than 10% by  weight and a salt rejection capability, tested with simulated  sea water under 40 to 70 atmospheres pressure and 25°c, of at  least 85% at a flux of at least about 400 l/m²d.  the cross-linked polyamide desalinizing layer is prefer­ ably polymerised in situ on the microporous support layer.  the composite materials are useful for the removal of  solute from solute-containing water.
