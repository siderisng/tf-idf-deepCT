<ABSTRACT>
a process for treating an electrolytic solution to recover a  concentrated solution from a dilute one in an electrolytic cell  (1) or in each of such cells divided by a permeabie diaphragm  (2) into a feed chamber (4a) and a recovery chamber (3a)  provided, respectively, with positive (5) and negative (6) elec­ trodes or vice versa.  a dilute electrolytic solution is fed to the feed chamber  (4a), and, while electrolysis is in progress between the elec­ trode (6) of the feed chamber and the electrode(5) held in the  recovery chamber (3a) in close proximity to, or in intimate  contact with, the diaphragm (2), the electrolyzed solution is  allowed to exude through the diaphragm (2) into the recovery  chamber (3a), whereby the concentrated solution is extracted  into the latter chamber.  in the apparatus for practicing the  process, either the negative (6) or positive (5) electrode is held  in the feed chamber (4a) and the other electrode is held in the  recovery chamber (3a) in close proximity to, or in intimate  contact with, the diaphragm (2).  the feed chamber (4a) is  provided with an inlet for the electrolvtic solution to be treated  and also with an outlet for the treated solution.  the recovery  chamber is provided with a jet means for injecting, at the start  of the electroysis, part of the electrolytic solution to be treated  against the diaphragm (2) and the latter electrode (5), a gas  outlet through which the gas generated at the electrode dur­ ing the electrolysis is released, and an acid outlet through  which a concentrated electrolytic solution that has exuded  into the recovery chamber (3a) as a result of the electrolytic  treatment is taken out of the vessel.
