<ABSTRACT>
a control mechanism is provided for a vehicle braking  system of the kind in which a pair of pressure modulating  valves (18) have their performance modified during vehicle  cornering only so that the brake on the inboard wheel  receives less pressure than the brake on the outboard  wheel.  the control mechanism comprises a member (21)  which has four points (22, 23, 24, 25) forming the corners  of a trapezium.  the first two points (22, 23), which are at  the ends of one of the parallel sides of the trapezium, are  connected to the suspension, the third point (24) is conÂ­ nected to the valves (18), whilst the fourth point (25) is  constrained from vertical movement.  during normal travel  the member (21) rotates freely about the third and fourth  points (24, 25) so that there is no input to the valves (18).   however, in cornering the vehicle roll causes the first and  second points (22, 23) to move differently so that the third  point (24) also tends to move so altering the performance  of the valves (18).
