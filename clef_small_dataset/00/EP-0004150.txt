<ABSTRACT>
an embeddment anchor (1) comprises a tie rod (2) on  which is mounted, at one end, thereof, anchoring means (3)  which may be of fluke-like form.  also mounted upon the tie  rod is a thrust member (5) which, in one embodiment, is  movable along part of the length of the tie rod (2).  the  anchoring means (3) are designed to provide a substantial  proportion of the resistance of the anchor (1), when embedded,  to uplift forces whilst the thrust member (5) provides a  substantial proportion of the resistance of the anchor (1)  when embedded, to lateral forces.  the thrust member (5)  may be so formed that it supports the tie rod (2) whilst the  latter is being embedded.
