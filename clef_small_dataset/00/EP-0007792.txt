<ABSTRACT>
synthetic polymeric adsorbents are produced from  lightly crosslinked macroreticular aromatic copolymer beads  by post crosslinking the copolymer beads while in a swollen  state, the crosslinks resulting from the post-crosslinking  comprising the residue of external crosslinker selected from  polyfunctional alkylating agent, polyfunctional acylating  agent and sulfur halide.  a friedel-crafts catalyst may be used  for the post-crosslinking.  the adsorbents may be functional­ ized to produce ion exchange resins.  the adsorbents are gen­ erally useful in processes for removing components from  fluids by adsorption, particularly in adsorbing organic com­ ponents from liquid or gas streams.  the ion exchange resins  are useful not only in ion exchange processes in general but  may also be useful as catalysts.

<DESCRIPTION>
synthetic polymeric adsorbents and ion exchange resins, their production and processes using them this invention is concerned with synthetic polymeric adsorbents and ion exchange resins, methods of preparing them and catalysis, adsorption and ion exchange processes using them, for example water-treatment processes, processes for the recovery of organic materials from gaseous and other streams and pharmaceutical purification processes. adsorbents are usually solids which exhibit selectivity at their surface for substances in a fluid mixture, thereby providing a means of separating such substances from the mixture. the high surface area characteristic of adsorbents (usually well above 5m.z/g of solid) normally results from a fine state of subdivision (non-porous adsorbents) or from pores in the adsorbent particles (porous adsorbents). carbon black and tio2 and zno pigments are examples of non-porous adsorbents. granular carbon, silica gel, bone char, certain soils and asbestos are examples of well-known porous adsorbents obtained from naturally occurring materials. for separation or purification of complex substances (such as pharmaceuticals) synthetic polymeric adsorbents have been developed, some of which serve also as ion exchange materials or as intermediates for the manufacture of ion exchange materials. however, ion exchange is an adsorption as well as an adsorption phenomenon, so that although all ion exchange materials are adsorbents, the converse is not necessarily true. synthetic adsorbents are usually porous polymeric solids, polystyrene and styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers being representative. although it is possible to prepare fine particle size synthetic polymers directly or by grinding larger particle size polymers to a fine particle size to obtain high surface area, fine particle size adsorbents cannot be used in cyclic processes, particularly processes involving adsorbent beds in columns, since the fine particles pack too tightly and impede fluid flow. adsorbents of moderately large particle size, about 0.02 mm. to 2 mm. diameter or greater, are therefore 7 req-uired. .lymeric..beads, obtained by knowji suspension polymerization techniques, have a convenient particle size for use in columnar operations. nevertheless, although the polymeric adsorbents can be made hydrophobic and the bead form enhances the usefulness of the polymeric adsorbents, their adsorbent properties have been somewhat unattractive in comparison with the carbonaceous adsorbents obtained from the pyrolysis of organic materials. however, the latter tend to suffer from high moisture pick up in humid atmospheres, from poor reproducibility during manufacture, and from such fine pores and rigid structure as to make them vulnerable to cracking, splitting and decripitation under high osmotic pressures such as are often encountered in cyclic operations. the preferred resins of this invention have a good balance of the desirable properties of these prior art resins and avoid their most serious deficiencies. in this regard, even though certain of the adsorbents of this invention may lack the extremely high surface areas of the known polymeric adsorbents or activated carbon adsorbents, they may still equal their performance, especially in adsorption capacity for organic liquids at high concentration. the adsorbents of the invention are polymeric materials in macroreticular bead form which, when functionalised, form ion exchange resins of the invention. the beads
