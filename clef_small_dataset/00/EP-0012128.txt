<ABSTRACT>
a spring assembly (56) for a floating seat ring (40) to urge  the seat ring into sealing engagement with the movable valve  member.  the seat ring (40) is mounted in an enlarged bore  portion at the valve chamber and has an annular rear face (52)  in opposed relation to a shoulder defined by the enlarged bore  portion.  the improved spring assembly (56) is mounted in the  spring pocket formed between the rear face (52) and the  shoulder and has a plurality of undulated annular wave  springs (58,60) about the seat ring (40).  each pair of contiguous  wave springs (58,60) is staggered so that the front nodes  of one wave spring in each contiguous pair is in opposed  contact relation to the rear nodes of the other wave spring of  each contiguous pair.  a flat portion (44a) on the outer circumference  of the seat ring (40) is in nested relation to a cooperating  flat portion (64) on the inner circumference (62) of the  wave spring (58,60) to maintain the wave spring (58,60) in an  oriented staggered relation.

<DESCRIPTION>
spring assembly for floating seat ring background of the invention heretofore, annular wave springs have been utilized to urge seat rings into sealing engagement with an associated valve member, such as a ball or gate. as shown in u.s. patent no. 2,548,128 to j. r. snyder dated april 10, 1951, and u.s. patent no. 3,387,815 to c. g. f. richards dated june 11, 1968, annular undulated wave springs are illustrated to urge a seat member into sealing engagement with an associated ball valve member. however, the prior art does not show the use of a plurality of annular undulated wave springs about a seat ring which are held in an oriented relation to each other so that contiguous wave springs are staggered with respect to the nodes of the springs. description of the present invention the present invention is directed to a spring assembly for a floating seat ring to urge the seat ring into sealing engagement with the adjacent valve member. it is particularly adapted to a ball valve seat ring in which the seat ring has a relatively large floating movement to permit the seat ring to be retracted to a position adequate to permit the removal of the ball valve member in a ball valve for replacement of the seat assembly or sealing element. the improved spring assembly is mounted in the spring pocket formed between the rear face of the seat ring and an opposed annular shoulder formed by a counterbore in the valve body at the valve chamber. the spring assembly comprises a plurality of undulated annular wave springs fitting about the seat ring, each pair of contiguous wave springs being staggered with respect to each other so that the front nodes of one wave spring in the contiguous pair is in opposed contact relation to the rear nodes in the other wave spring of the contiguous pair. a flat portion on the outer circumference of the seat ring is in nested relation to a cooperating flat portion on the inner circumference of the wave springs and maintain the wave springs in an oriented staggered relation thereby to prevent any relative circumferential movement of the wave springs with respect to each other. as illustrated in copending application serial no. 902,324 filed may 3, 1978 and entitled "means and method for in-line removal of seat rings in ball valves" a so-called top entry ball valve is shown in which the upper cover plate is first removed, and then the seat rings and ball are easily removed from the valve body while the valve is in place in a flowline. the rotative movement of the baji is ti"lized to can the seat rings away from the ball to a fully retracted position where they are releasably retained while the ball is removed. thus, a relatively large floating movement of the seat rings is desired and necessary in order to permit the removal of the ball. a camming tool is usually utilized with the ball to can the

what is claimed is:   1. in a valve including a valve body having inlet and outlet flow passages communicating with a valve chamber, a valve member mounted in said valve chamber for movement between open and closed positions relative to the flow passages, an annular shoulder at the juncture of each flow passage with the valve chamber, and a seat ring mounted about each flow passage and having an annular rear face in opposed spaced relation to the associated shoulder to provide a spring pocket therebetween, the improvement comprising: :  an annular spring assembly in the spring pocket between said rear face and said shoulder adapted to urge the seat ring toward the valve member, said spring assembly including at least a pair of contiguous undulated annular wave springs about the seat ring each wave spring having a plurality of rear and front nodes, the rear nodes on the rearmost wave spring being in contact with said shoulder and the front nodes on the foremost wave spring being in contact with said rear face, said pair of contiguous wave springs being staggered with the front nodes of one wave spring of said pair in opposed contact relation to the rear nodes of the other wave spring of said pair, and means to maintain each pair of wave springs in such staggered position.   2. in a valve as set forth in claim 1 wherein said means to maintain each pair of wave springs in staggered position comprises a flat portion about the outer circumference of the seat ring and a cooperating nesting flat portion about the inner circumference of the wave springs to hold the wave springs against rotative movement.   3. in a ball valve as set forth   n    claim 1 wherein each wave spring has a plurality of alternate front nodes and intervening rear nodes, the front nodes being spaced circumferentially of the wave spring about ninety (90) degrees with respect to each other.   4. a top entry ball valve including a valve body having inlet and outlet flow passages communicating with a valve chamber, a ball mounted in said valve chamber for rotation between open and closed positions relative to the flow passages, an upper cover plate removably secured to the valve body and permitting removal of the ball from the valve body when the cover plate is removed, an annular shoulder at the juncture of each flow passage with the valve chamber;    a seat ring mounted about each flow passage and having an annular rear face in opposed spaced relation to the associated shoulder to provide a spring pocket therebetween; ;  an annular spring assembly in the spring pocket between said rear face and   soid    shoulder adapted to urge the seat ring toward the ball, said spring assembly including at least a pair of undulated annular wave springs about the seat ring each wave spring having a plurality of rear and front nodes, the rear nodes on the rearmost wave spring being in contact with said shoulder and the front nodes on the foremost wave spring being in contact with said rear face, said pair of contiguous wave springs being staggered with the front nodes of one wave spring of said pair in opposed contact relation to the rear nodes of the other wave spring of said pair, means to maintain each pair of wave springs in such staggered position, means to urge the seat ring to a retracted position in which the wave springs are compressed,   and means to hold the seat ring in the retracted position.   5. a top entry ball   valise    as set forth in claim 4 wherein said means to hold the seat ring in retracted position comprises a plunger adapted' to contact the outer circumference of the wave springs to urge the inner circumference of the wave springs into frictional engagement with the seat ring, said plunger being operated from a position outside the valve body.
