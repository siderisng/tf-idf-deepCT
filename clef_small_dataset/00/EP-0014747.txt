<ABSTRACT>
Secondary and tertiary 2-carboxivethyl and carboximethyl phosphines as well as their salts of general formulas R-P (CH₂COOME) ₂ I or R - P (CH₂-CH₂-COOME) ₂ II, wherein Me is hydrogen, alkali metal or NR'₄ -Rest with R 'equals hydrogen and / or alkyl or aryl radical and R which fabric, a straight-chain, branched or cycloaliphatically saturated or unsaturated alkyl radical having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and in the case of general formula II (an optionally substituted aryl radical with 6 to 14 can be prepared by the corresponding cyanoalkylphosphine, first with an aqueous alcohal alkali metal hydroxide solution, they are produced by the aqueous solution of the acid salts treated with a highly acidic ione exchanger and the free acids provided with neutralized an alkali metal hydroxide or ammonia or amine, and find use as catalysts IL in the oligomerization of ethylene with the aid of a nickel catalyst.
