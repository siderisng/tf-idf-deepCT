positively on the undercut surface of a dowel (10) provided with a undercut bore (10) with an elongated fastening bolt (18), on the bore-hearted end latch elements (22) are supported, which partially arranged on the fastening bon zen (18) axially displaceable conical construction (28) of a layer lying within the diameter of the Boh tion (12) are swiveled into a surface (17) overlapping position. The locking elements (22) are supported on a head piece (20) at the hole inside end of the fastening bolt (18) and have the shape of itself in the non-swiveled position to a thick-walled sleeve he entirely full sleeve segments. Between the axially displaceably arranged coil construction (28) and a screw head provided at the outer end of the fastening bolt and screwed on a thread on this end nut (38) is arranged a coil spring (32) set by axial compression under bias voltage. The locking elements (22) may be fixed to the locking position against disguising kung, wherein means for releasing this fixation according to at least partial insertion of the dowel (10) are provided in the undercut bore (12).
