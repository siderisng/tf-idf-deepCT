<ABSTRACT>
1.  installation for making stub tubing in a wall (1) of very great thickness for a pressure vessel, comprising a press and a punch (4) provided at its end with a centering tip (41) and having a cone-shaped widened portion (42) which is connected by a rounded connecting surface in its lower part to the centering tip and in its upper part to a concave portion (43) widening upwards from a diameter practically equal to that of the tubing to be obtained, the installation also containing a tubular anvil (5) having a cylindrical central passage (50) connected to a rounded bearing face of the wall by an annular inner surface (51) with a shape corresponding to that of the tubing to be obtained, characterised in that the surfaces for connecting the cone (42) at its ends have such small radii that these connections practically form a sharp edge, the cone (42) thus being connected directly to the concave portion (43) of the punch (4).
