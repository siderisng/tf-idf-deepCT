<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates principally to vehicle fluid pressure  braking systems in which valve devices controlled by the  vehicle suspension system operate only during vehicle cornering  to reduce pressure to the brake which is on a wheel  which is on the inside of the corner.  the braking system uses a variable ratio lever mechanism  to balance the loadings due to pressure in two valve  devices (55,56).  the lever mechanism includes levers  (102,105), control links (107,112), balance beam (109) and a  reaction link (115).  a control mechanism, which can be of a  known kind, moves the reaction link during vehicle cornering  and thus alters the angle which each control link makes with  a line joining the axes of the lever pivots (103,106) and the  link pivots (108,113).
