<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for producing weather-resistant panels or mouldings which consist of wood particles mixed with binding agents, of fibres containing lignocellulose or of raw materials prepared in another way and which are pressed together under the influence of heat, characterized in that before hot-pressing a covering layer (2) made of vulcanisable elastomeric materials, such as natural and/or synthetic rubber of the like, is applied to the top side and/or underside of the cake (9) of chips which has been formed from the wood particles, fibres containing lignocellulose or raw materials prepared in another way, whereupon hot-pressing is carried out with simultaneous vulcanising of the covering layers.
