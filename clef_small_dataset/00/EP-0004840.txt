<ABSTRACT>
a drill boom arrangement comprises a boom proper (10)  that is universally pivotably mounted on a support plate (13).   the boom is swingable by means of two hydraulic cylinders  (16, 17) that are coupled between the support plate and the  boom to form a tripod with the boom.  the hydraulic  cylinders are located on each side of a vertical plane through  the boom.  a boom head (24) is universally pivotably  mounted on the outer end of the boom (10) and it carries a  feed beam (40) for a rock drill (41).  the boom head is  swingable by means of two hydraulic cylinders (27, 28) that  are coupled between the boom and the boom head to form  another tripod with the boom.  these two tripods have  similar geometry but the hydraulic cylinders of one tripod is  located under the boom and the hydraulic cylinders of the  other tripod is located above the boom.  the left hand  hydraulic cylinder of one tripod is hydraulically coupled in  series with the right hand hydraulic cylinder of the other  tripod and vice versa so as to provide for parallel displacement  of the feed beam when the boom is being swung.
