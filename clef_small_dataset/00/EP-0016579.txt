<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus (10) for providing active cooling for semi­ conductor wafers during implantation in an ion implantation  chamber includes a housing (40) incorporating a convexly  curved platen (30).  the platen (30) has a coating (31) of a  pliable thermally conductive material adhered to the surface  thereof.  a clamping ring (36) is mounted within the housing  (40) in slidable relationship with the convexly curved platen  (30) so that the travel of the clamping ring (36) ranges between  a receiving position wherein the clamping ring and the con­ vexly curved platen define a slot (11) for receiving a semicon­ ductor wafer (13, 32) and a locked position wherein a semi­ conductor wafer (13, 32) is firmly pressed against the con­ vexly curved platen (30) by the contact of the clamping ring  (36) against the semiconductor wafer (13, 32) at its circumfe­ rential edge.  in the locked position the wafer (13, 32) substan­ tially conforms on its back side to the contour of the  convexly  curved platen (30).  an active cooling means (28, 39-41) is  provided for transferring thermal energy away from the pla­ ten (30).
