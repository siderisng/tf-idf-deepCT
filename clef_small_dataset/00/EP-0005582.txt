<ABSTRACT>
a method of making slub or thick and thin yarns with  twist variation an open end spinning machines operates by  changing the speed of the yarn as it leaves the rotor of the  open end spinning machine.  the method produces a unique  slub yarn which has a portion of high twist adjacent the slub  in the yarn which has lower yarn twist.  in the apparatus, the  roving 12 is spun by a rotor in a housing 14 and leaves  through a doff tube 18 from whence it passes through rollers  21,23 to be wound on to a roll 28.  a lever 20 with a roller 19 at  its end swings randomly up and down to lengthen and  shorten the yarn between the doff tube 18 and rollers 21,23  thereby speeding up and slowing down the speed of the yarn  leaving the doff tube.
