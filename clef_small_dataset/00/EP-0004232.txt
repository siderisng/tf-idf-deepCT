<ABSTRACT>
1.  a coupling device interposed between the rear of a tractor (1) and an implement (2, 31), the coupling being of the type called a three-point coupling with two lower arms (6) having controlled elevation and an upper retaining arm (12), and comprising a drive transmission (15) to the implement by means of cardan homokinetic joints, characterised in that, at its rear, the tractor is provided with an elevator mast (4) on which the upper arm (12) is articulated, with a support apron (5) which is moveable along the elevator mast and extends transversely of the tractor and which is designed both to receive articulation pivots (10) of the two lower arms (6) of the three-point coupling, any point of each arm (6) being connected by means of an adjustable supporting rod (7) to a point (11) of the support apron located in the vertical plane of the corresponding arm, and to carry a motor device (13) which is connected to the implement by means of the transmission (15) having cardan joints.
