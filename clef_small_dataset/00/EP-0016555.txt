<ABSTRACT>
a full-frame flash illumination system for a document  copying machine including an optical cavity (10) having  interior walls coated with a white, diffusely reflecting mater­ ial.  one end (20) of the cavity contains a platen (24) for posi­ tioning a document to be copied while the opposing end (30)  contains a lens (34) for forming an image of the document on a  light sensitive image plane (36).  illumination from a single  flash illumination source (42) located within the cavity,  undergoes multiple reflecions from the walls resulting in a  uniform diffuse illumination of the document.

<DESCRIPTION>
full-frame flash illumination system for a document copying machine the present invention relates to a full-frame, flash illumination system, for a document copying machine. as demands for faster copying and duplicating have increased, conventional machines which scan documents in incremental fashion to provide a flowing image on a xerographic drum have proved inadequate. new high speed techniques have evolved which utilize flash exposure of an entire document (full-frame) and the arrangement of a moving photoconductor in a flat condition at the instant of exposure. in prior art flash illumination systems, the illumination at the document plane can be generally described as either wholly specular, or partially specular, partially diffuse. u. s. patents 3,777,135; 3,586,849 and 3,669,538 are typical of optical systems of the former type. in each of the disclosed systems, light from a plurality of flash lamps is directly reflected, by means of reflective elements partially enclosing the lamps, toward the object to be illuminated, i.e. a document lying on a platen. light reflected from the document passes through a lens to be focused onto the image plane. however, a significant portion of the light generated by the light source is absorbed by the housing walls or passes out of the illumination area prior to, and following incidence on, the platen. these illumination losses reduce the amount of light reaching the lens and, therefore, to achieve adequate exposure, a plurality of high intensity light sources utilizing large and costly power supplies are required. significant gains in illumination efficiency can be obtained if the light sources are enclosed within an integrating cavity whose walls are made of, or coated with, a nearly diffuse reflecting material. the theoretical implications of diffusely illuminating an object by causing multiple reflections within an "integrating sphere?! is set forth in principles of optics, pp. d 8- 283, (mcgraw hill, 1932). it is therein disclosed that, if the interior wall of a sphere is coated with a white, diffusely reflecting material with high reflectance, multiple reflections within the sphere produce an almost uniform diffuse illumination of an object plane. copier illumination systems as disclosed in u. s. patents 3,97,177 (booth); 3,498,715 (gold) and 3,428,397 (elmer) have attempted to utilize this principle with varying degrees of success. a diffusely reflecting integrating cavity has also been used to achieve uniform fixing of a developed xerographic image as disclosed in u. s. patent 3,529,129. (rees). the gold and elmer references are representative of optical systems which illuminate an object plane with light that is both diffuse and specular. in gold, a pair of lamps are partially enclosed by baffles with reflective interiors. the lamps directly illuminate the object plane with increased illumination directed towards the end of the support by the baffles and by diffuse reflecting surfaces located above the lamps. the housing, however, is not a true integrating cavity since the chamber is not wholly enclosed and many areas are blackened to achieve the specific purposes set forth in the disclosure. elmer also uses a pair of lamps

claims:    1. a full-frame flash illumination system for a document copying macnine   onaracterised    by:  a housing (10) having a top surface (20) defining an object plane and   containing    a platen (24) for supporting  a document to be copied,   a    bottom surface (30)   accoirmodating    a lens   (3a)    for focusing an image of a document onto  an image plane (36) said housing being completely enclosed by side walls (16) (14) joined to said top and bottom  surfaces, said housing having its interior  surfaces completely covered with a high reflectivity material such that said surfaces are highly diffusely  reflective to light incident thereon, and by having  a single flash illumination source (46) positioned within  said housing between said top and bottom surfaces,  and  means to intermittently pulse said illumination  source to produce light flashes which undergo multiple  reflections from said coated surfaces to provide a uni  formly diffuse irradiation at the platen.    '2. the illumination system of claim 1 further  comprising a first blocking element (43) positioned between  the source and the platen of sufficient length and width  to prevent direct illumination from the source from reach  ing any portion of the platen.    3. the illumination system of claim 2 wherein  said blocking element has an aperture (52) therein.    4. the illumination system of claim 2 or claim 3  further including a second blocking element   145)    posi  tioned between the source and the lens of sufficient  length and width to prevent direct illumination of the  lens.      5. the illumination system-of claim 3 wherein said blocking element has an additional blocking element (65) overlying but spaced apart from said aperture said overlying blocking element intercepting and reflecting light emerging from said aperture.     6. the illumination system of any one of claims 2 to 5 wherein the blocking elements are translucent.    7. the illumination system of any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein said platen is coated on both sides with an anti-reflecion material.    8. the illumination system of claim 1 wherein an illumination source (70) is positioned within a recess   76)    of one of said side walls (16) whereby direct illum   a.ion    from said source does not reach said platen.    9. the illumination system of claim 8 wherein the walls of said recess are covered with a specular reflector material.    10. the illumination system of claim 8 or claim 9 wherein the wall (18) opposite said wall (16) containing said recess has coated thereon a specular strip (68) said strip being located so as to specularly reflect direct illumination from said source.
