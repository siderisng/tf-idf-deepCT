<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method for loading and  unloading a lengthy object, such as a container (3), onto a  vehicle or a semi-trailer (2) of a lorry, which is provided with  adjustable support legs (5) at the rear end of the trailer (2).   the trailer (2) also has a bogie (4) movable in the longitudinal  direction of the trailer (2), and the object (3) is pulled onto the  vehicle for support by means of a winch (8).  the trailer (2) is  supported from the ground by means of the support legs (5)  and the bogie (4) is shifted to the front end of the trailer (2).   the bogie (4), at the end of the shifting movement, pushes  the tractor vehicle (1) away from underneath the trailer (2).   the rear end of the trailer (2) is lowered onto the ground by  means of the support legs (5) and the container (3) is pulled  onto the trailer (2) for support.
