<ABSTRACT>
in a drum brake assembly a hydraulic actuator (16) is  engageable with a pair of brake shoes (12, 14) to move the  same into engagement with a rotatable member.  a parking  lever (26) also cooperates with the pair of brake shoes (12, 14)  to move the same into engagement with the rotatable  member and an anchor plate (34) forms a connecting member  between the pair of brake shoes.  a backing plate (10) supports  the pair of brake shoes (12, 14) and the anchor plate (34).  the  anchor plate (34) is movably supported by the backing plate  (10) and a latch (36) cooperates with the anchor plate (10) in a  first position to fix the anchor plate (34) to the backing plate  (10).  the latch (36) is movable to a second position spaced  from the anchor plate (10) to permit the latter to move relative  to the backing plate (10).  in order to control the position  setting of the latch (30), the latch is coupled to the parking  lever (26) so that the latch (36) remains in the first position  until the parking lever (26) is moved whereupon the latch (36)  is also moved to the second position.  consequently, when the  hydraulic actuator (16) is operated in a service brake applicaÂ­ tion, the anchor plate (34) remains fixed to the backing plate  (10) to form a non-servo drum brake and when the parking  brake (26) is operated, the anchor plate (34) is movable with  the pair of brake shoes (12, 14) in the direction of the rotatable  member (18) to form a duo-servo drum brake.
