<ABSTRACT>
a turbine cartridge assembly (19) for a gas-driven dental  handpiece has a pair of bearing assemblies (38,39) on the  rotor shaft (30) and axial and radial support means associated  with the bearing assemblies.  the radial support means may  comprise a ring of resilient material (62,63) around each bear足 ing assembly to provide radial support for the cartridge  assembly (19) within the housing (18) and dampens the trans足 fer of vibration.  the axial support means may comprise a  resilient spacer member, e. g.  a spring-like washer (60),  associated with either or each bearing assembly (38,39) for  compression between the outer race (41,44) of the bearing  assembly and portions (29,28) of the handpiece housing (18)  to axially preload the bearing assemblies (38,39).  the radial  and axial support means are retained on the cartridge assem足 bly (19) e. g.  by snap rings (64,65), so that the cartridge (19) is  removably insertable in the handpiece housing (18) as a unit足 ary assembly.
