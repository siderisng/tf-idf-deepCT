<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to data processing system with  channel error logging.  the specification describes an apparatus for assem­ bling information concerning the occurrence of a channel  (3) error to form a channel error event consisting of four  fields: a channel function field; a field identifying the i/o  register in use at the occurrence of the channel error; a  field identifying the particular i/o adapter (4) using the  channel (3) when the error occurred; and a field specify­ ing the type of channel error.  the four-field channel error  event is placed in an i/o event stack in main memory (5)  accessible to the cpu (1), and the cpu is notified of the  addition to the i/o event stack.  if the attempt to store the  channel error event on the i/o event stack fails, the chan­ nel (3) is stopped until the cpu (1) signals the channel  to restart and to again attempt to log the channel error  event on the i/o event stack.
