<ABSTRACT>
a safety device for ensuring relief of excessive pressure  in an associated vessel, the device incorporating a reverse  buckling disc (8) clamped between inlet support means  (14,24) and outlet support means (16,18,22), knife blades (20)  to the outlet side of the device for rupturing the dome portion  (10) of the disc on reversal of said dome portion when the  pressure in the vessel reaches a critical value, and an annular  ring member (16) also to the outlet side of the device located  and dimensioned to dampen or retard the movement of the  dome portion during reversal, thereby to prevent the segments  of the dome portion formed on rupturing from being  torn away from the flange portion (12) of the disc as might  otherwise occur.
