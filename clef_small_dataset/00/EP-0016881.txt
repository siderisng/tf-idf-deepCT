<ABSTRACT>
a gas recovery method and apparatus for the recovery  and storage of a gas from a gas enclosure or circuit, particular­ ly suitable for the recovery of sulphur hexafluoride (sf₆) from  the arc chamber of a high voltage/current circuit breaker.  a  gas holding vessel (22) is connected, suitably via quick con­ nect coupling (24) and a non-return valve (23), to the gas cir­ cuit or enclosure.  means (21) are provided to hold the vessel at  a temperature below that at which the gas is transformed from  vapour to liquid or solid phase.  suitably a dewar flask and  liquid nitrogen are used.  the liquefied or solidified gas can be  stored in the vessel until required for recharging the circuit or  enclosure.

<DESCRIPTION>
"gas recovery" this invention relates to gas recovery and is more specifically concerned with the recovery of gases from enclosures containing equipment which has to operate in a gaseous environment other than air. there are many areas of technology in which fairly large equipment is required to operate in an atmosphere of a particular gas. one such area is the electrical supply industry where, for example, electric circuit breakers are often required to operate in an atmosphere of sulphur hexafluoride (sf6) gas. sulphur hexafluoride gas is relatively expensive and it is normally recovered and stored if equipment which normally works in the gas is to be serviced or repaired. as the equipment may be sited in remote areas, a portable assembly is used to recover the gas and to recharge the equipment with the gas after the equipment has been serviced or repaired. such assembly comprises a large pump and a storage vessel normally mounted on a vehicle. the amount of gas to be recovered may be 200kg or more, and, as it is normally at pressures between 4 and perhaps 20 atmospheres in the enclosure, the pump used must have a high capacity and the assembly is therefore a cumbersome and expensive piece of equipment, which is used only intermittently. the present invention seeks to amend the need for high capacity pumps by providing a gas recovery apparatus comprising at least one vessel connectable to an enclosure or circuit from which a gas is to be recovered and means for holding the vessel at a temperature below that at which the gas is transformed from its vapour phase to a liquid or solid phase. the apparatus of the invention has the advantage that the use of a high pressure pump is avoided altogether and the gas storage vessels are reduced in size, perhaps fourfold. the conversion of the recovered gas to its liquid phase produces a drop in pressure which induces its own pumping action so that the gas can be rapidly withdrawn from the enclosure or circuit by way of a coupling and, when cold, stored at a pressure at or beneath atmospheric pressure. the cooling arrangement conveniently comprises a bath of liquid nitrogen. the vessel may take the form of a stainless steel or aluminium cylinder mounted in the bath. liquid nitrogen has the advantage that air is not liquified when contained in vessels at temperatures just above the boiling point of the liquid nitrogen. the recovered gas may therefore be separated from air which may have contaminated it through leakage, by applying ä ' ¯-- uum pump to the vessel after the gas has been solidified in the vessel. the invention is particularly well-suited to recovering sulphur hexafluoride from electrical circuit breakers and other such equipment. sulphur hexafluoride is solid at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (-1960c) and liquid nitrogen is readily available as a cheap safe, refrigerant. the apparatus can be stored at a mainten ance depot for servicing a number of circuit breakers and
