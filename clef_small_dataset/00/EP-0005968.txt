<ABSTRACT>
an electronic or computer-based railway control system wherein control signals are transmitted between a control or interlocking room and wayside or track equipment by means of time division multi-plexed signals.  several such t. d. m.  communication systems are employed in parallel to provide redundancy, and each address location has a majority voting circuit, to determine a correct signal in the event of disagreement between signal, and an out-of-coincidence circuit to indicate which system is carrying the erroneous signal.
