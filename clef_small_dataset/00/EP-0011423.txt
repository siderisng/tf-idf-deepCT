<ABSTRACT>
a stack pack type of electrolytic cell, suitable for the generation of chlorates or hypochlorites of sodium or potassium, is disclosed.  such materials are useful for the treatment of water effluents, but varying demand raises problems which known production apparatus cannot deal with.  the cell (10) of the invention has the ability to make economical use of materials, while eliminating the necessity for large external studs for the electrode components, housings to retain fluids and intercell piping connections, since the cell can easily be increased or reduced in capacity by adding or removing chambers and electrode stack packs to or from the cell itself or by adding or removing electrodes to or from the stack packs.  the electrolytic cell proposed can utilize mass-produced components and can be assembled either in a monopolar or bipolar configuration, so as to make most efficient use of existing electrical supply equipment.  between end plates (12), chamber sections (22) alternate with electrode stack packs (24, 26, 38) to form the cell (10) and these units are compressed by tie rods (16) which engage cross members (14) in contact with the end plates (12).
