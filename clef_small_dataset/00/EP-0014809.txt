<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for determining the vapour content of a  gas/vapour mixture comprises two temperature sensing  devices (4,7).  one of the devices (4) measures the temperature  of a liquid evaporating from a liquid saturated wick (5) in  contact with the device.  the other temperature sensing device  (7) measures the temperature of the gas/vapour mixture in  which it is immersed.  a cooling device (1,14) is provided for  condensing some of the vapour from the gas/vapour mixture  to maintain a liquid supply for the wick (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for determining vapour content of a gas/vapour mixture. the invention relates to apparatus for determiring the valour content of a gas/vapour mixture. such apparatus, hereinafter referred to as of the kind described, comprises two temperature sensing devices one of which measures the temperature of a liquid evaporating from a liquid saturated wick in contact with the device, and the other of which measures the temperature of the gas/vapour mixture in which it is immersed. in one well know, method for determining relative humidity, the two temperature sensing devices are provided by mercury in glass thermometers one of which has its bulb covered with a sleeve of a suitable textile material which dips into a small reservoir of distilled water and acts as a wick. the water is drawn up the wick by capillary action so that the bulb of the thermometer is always surrounded by a water surface exposed to the gas. this "wet" bulb is cooled by the evaporation of the water. the temperature difference between the wet and the "dry" bulbs is called the depression of the wet bulb temperature. the relationship between the partial pressure (e) of water vapour in the gas, the vapour pressure (e') of water at the temperature of the wick, and the depression of the wet bulb temperature is usually given by the following cqjeq.ion: e = e' - 6.66 x 10 4p (t -t') where p is the atmospheric pressure, t is the gas temperature in degrees c, and t' is the wet bulb temperature in degrees c. the relative humidity of the gas can then be found by knowing the wet and dry bulb temperatures, since the water content of the gas by volume is very simply related to the partial pressure of the water vapour in the gas. because the rate of evaporation and the rate of heat transfer depend on the same process of molecular diffusion the same equation can be used over a wide range of gas velocities. the wet and dry bulb thermometer is normally used for spot checks on atmospheric humidity. the unit, comprising the two thermometers and the distilled water reservoir, is swung gently to and fro in-the air and the two temperatures are noted. problems arise when an attempt is made to use this unit to measure gas humidity on a continuous basis in an industrial process. it is found difficult to provide a continuous supply of distilled water. according to the present invention, apparatus of the kind described, for determining -the -vapour content of a gas/vapour mixture is characterised by the provision of a cooling device for condensing some of the vapour from the gas/vapour mixture to maintain a liquid supply for the wick. thus by condensing out, for example the water vapour, already present in the gas the need for a separate water supply for the wick is avoided. the cooling device may comprise a reservoir for collection of the condensed vapour and in which part of the wick is located.
