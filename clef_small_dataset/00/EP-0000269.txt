<ABSTRACT>
method for thermally toughening glass sheets and glass  sheets obtained by this method, in particular to be used as  motor vehicle side or rear windows.  a method of thermally toughening glass sheets for use  as motor vehicle side or rear windows so that the glass  sheets produced conform to regulations specifying fracture  requirements.  the glass sheets are advanced through a quenching station  for gas quenching.  the glass is subjected to at least one  localised gas flow which is pulsed at a repetition frequency  related to the speed or advance of the glass sheet through  the quenching statement.  the method induces in the glass  sheet a distribution or regions of more highly toughened  glass interspersed with regions of lesser toughened glass.
