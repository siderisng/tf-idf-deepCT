<ABSTRACT>
the combination implement consists of a float, a spring-lined harrow and a ribbed roller.  the harrow frame is rigidly attached to the float frame, the roller being attached to the rearward end of an arm which is pivoted to the harrow frame.  a compressed spring acts between the harrow frame and arm to load the latter downwardly.  the fastening for the spring is pref.  adjustable to obtain the desired height and pressure against the ground of the roller.  the spring can be a curved blade spring.  the implement allows one-pass seed bed preparations after ploughing.  the tines are mounted to be linearly adjustable, the working depth of all the tool combinations being totally controllable.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention perains to ;t improvement on farming implement comprising a combination of a float, an s-tine harrow and i rihbed roller. after plowing, he ground must t)e work rid such that. the sowing fielci will lie as even as possible, wit )'; few clods :j possible. the most common method is to work the ground in several operations, fist driving over the newly-plowed earth with a float, then with a harrow, and possibly following with ;i ribbed roller. combination implements are known, however, consisting of a float, harrow and ribbed roller, where these implerr√®nts, as one unit, are drawn behind a tractor. in the previously known implements of this type, the harrow frame has been hinged to the float frime, and the ribbed roller has been rigidly fastened to the rear end of the harrow frame, for example, by gleans of an arm. the object of the present invention is to simplify nd improve the above combination implement. this is obtained accord- ing to the invention in that the frame for the s-tine harrow is rigidly attached to the float frame, that the ribbed roller is attached to the rearward end of in arm whose forward end is attached so as to be pivotable in the vertical plane to the reur of the harrow frame, and that the arm for the roller drum is loaded in the downward direction by means of a compressed spring arranged between the harrow frame and the nrm. a practical embodiment is characterized in that the fastening of the spring is adjustable, permitting one to regulate the desired height and pressure against the round of the rib roller a suitable spring for the purpose is a curved @@@ade spring. a further development of the invention is characterized in that blades or knives ure arranged on the undersides ofti@@ float heams, shid blades or knives extending obliquely in reiation to the working direction of the float. a further feature of the invention is that the s-tines on the harrow, in a manner known per se, ere arranged in trans- verse rows ; each row is suspended in a two-armed lever whicb rotatably supported on the frame, and all of the arms are con nected to a common adjustment member. the implement of the invention is very simple in @@@@ struction, and is therefore inexpensive to produce. owiag rigid coupling betwaen the float frame and harrow frame, @@e special height-adjusting means for the s-tines and the springs loaded ribbed roller, one will heve full control crar the warit depth of all of the tool comhinations. in addition, the spacis suspension of the s-tines on the harrow permits a practicmtig lim@au @djustment of the tines, as opposed to @@evious embodi@@ in which the tines, as they moved, described a relstively @@ @ircle such that the angle of engagement of the teeth the herrow movod along the invention will be explained in greater debail is this following with reference to the drawing, which shows one embod ment
