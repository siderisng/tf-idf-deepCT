<ABSTRACT>
a releasably lockable joint which is particularly intended  for use as the knee joint of an orthopaedic leg support com­ prises first and second members (10, 11) pivoted together for  relative flexing movement and having faces (13,14) which  abut to prevent movement of the joint beyond the unflexed  position.  a sliding detent (20) in a slot (19) in the member (11)  is resiliently biased into engagement with a lock surface (17)  of a recess or shoulder (17, 18) in the adjoining end of the  member (10) to lock the joint in the unflexed position.  the  detent (20) is actuated by a release (26) which is preferably in  the form of an external ring pivoted to the front edge of the  second member (11) and connected at an intermediate posi­ tion to the detent (20) by means of a pivot pin (28).  preferably  the detent (20) exerts a wedging action on the lock face (17) so  as to minimise play as the joint wears in service.  the joint may  be provided as a separate sub-assembly for fitting to plain  steels.  the joint can be used by patients requiring a ring-catch,  bar lock or cable release mechanism without alteration to any  operating part except the release member.

<DESCRIPTION>
lockable hinge joint for limb supports and other orthopaedic appliances the present invention relates to a lockable joint which is particularly, but not exclusively, useful as a knee joint of an orthopaedic leg support. a leg brace includes thigh supports ("steels) to either side of the thigh and calf steels to either side of the lower part of the leg, the thigh and shank steels on each side of the leg being connected by a pivot joint at knee level. the pivot joint on one or both sides of the knee is arranged to be locked when the patient is standing or walking but has to be releasable to allow the knee joint to flex when the patient is sitting. the release mechanism may be operated by a ring catch or drop lock which is a sliding ring on the thigh steel which may be lowered into engagement with the pivot joint to lock it -and which is lifted to release the joint. another kind of lock known as a bar lock or french lock involves a hinged release member pivoted to the thigh steel and operated by lifting an extension bar attached to the release member. where bar locks are used, the pivot joints on both sides of the knee are normally lockable and the release members on opposite sides of the knee are interconnected by means of a bar extending around the back of the knee. a further kind of release mechanism employs a hinged release member having an extension bar to which a lifting cable may be fixed. #the patient's disability may often affect parts of his body other than his legs, and the orthopaedic fitter has to select from the range of available release mechanisms one-which is within the patient' 8 capacity to operate. known types of release mechanisms and in particular the ring catch and bar lock mechanisms operate on different principles and require differently shaped# hinge members. the fact that different kinds of release mechanism require the differently shaped hinge members and different ancillary parts decreases the length of production runs and increases the number of parts required to be stocked by a limb fitting centre, both of which are factors tending to increase the cost of orthopaedic limb supports. it is an object of the invention to provide a release mechanism in which the same hinge members may be used in association with different release mechanisms and in particular in association with a release operating analogously to a ring catch by upward finger pressure from the rear of the release mechanism and also in association with a bar lock or cable release,the only modification required being to the release member. manually operated ring catches are not normally spring loaded into the locked position and suffer from the disadvantage that they may accidentally be shaken out of engagement while the patient is walking however, the joint of the invention may be released by upward finger pressure like a manual ring catch but the release

claims:      t.    a releasably lockable joint for an orthopaedic limb support or for an artificial limb, which joint comprises first and second members   (10,11)    pivoted together at their ends for relative flexing movement and having faces (13,14) which abut when the joint is unflexed to prevent movement beyond the unflexed position characterised in #that the first member has an arcuate end (16) which terminates in a recess or shoulder (17,18) and the adjoining end of the second member has a slot (19) which is in register with the base of said recess or shoulder when the joint is unflexed and which extends axially away from the recess or shoulder, a detent (20) slidable in the slot being resiliently biased into a position in which it engages said recess or shoulder and being retractable into the slot by operation of a release (26),  the detent being supported or supportable in a retracted position by said arcuate portion   (¯16)    when the joint is flexed and being urged into engagement with said recess or shoulder (17) when the joint is straightened to lock the joint in the unflexed position.      a    ajoint according to claim   1,    wherein the head of the second member   (llj    is split to form a-fork bracket having two transversely spaced part circular leaves between which is pivoted a reduced thickness portion (15) of the first member (10).   3. a joint according to claim 1 or 2, further comprising a releasable catch for locking the detent in the retracted position.   4. a joint according to claim 3, wherein the releasable catch comprises an auxiliary channel (22) in the second member opening into the detent channel, a ball  catch (23,24) in the auxiliary channel resiliently biased to project therefrom, and a recess (25) in the detent positioned to be engaged by the ball of the ball catch when the detent is retracted.   5. a joint according to any preceding claim, wherein the detent is wedge-shaped with its rear face inclined at a small acute angle with respect to the front face to engage the lock face (17) of the recess or shoulder in the first member which is directed parallel to the inclined face of the detent when the joint is unflexed, the wedging action between the detent (20) and the lock face (17) minimising play in the joint.   6. a joint according to any preceding claim, wherein the interengaging faces of the detent and the shoulder (17) or recess are directed at approximately a right angle to the stop faces (13,14) when the joint is unflexed.    7. a joint according to any preceding claim, wherein the release comprises a lever (26) extending transversely of the second member and pivoted at an edge (27) thereof, the lever being connected by means of a pivot pin (28) to the detent (20) and extending from the opposite edge.   8. a joint according to claim 7, wherein the lever (26) is in the form of an external ring fitted to the second member with its front edge pivotally received in a recess in the front edge of the second member and the internal surface of its rear edge normally spaced from the rear edge of the second member, an upward movement of the rear edge of the ring retracting the detent (20) into the slot (19).   9. a joint according to claim 8, wherein the rear portion of the ring (26) is provided with a socket for  receiving an extension lever (31) which forms part of a bar lock or cable lift device.
