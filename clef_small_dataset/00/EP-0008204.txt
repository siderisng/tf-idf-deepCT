<ABSTRACT>
this invention is concerned with carburetion of gaso­ line for the purpose of reducing the consumption of gaso­ line and preventing pollution.  the procedure for carrying  out this function is by evaporation and osmosis.  in the low­ er chamber (14) of the carburetor where the liquid gaso­ line is located are immersed a plurality of special tubes (5).   the tubes (5) have in their lower portion on the inside sur­ face an absorbant material, and wicks extending therefrom.   in the upper portion of the tubes where the wicks are lo­ cated, there are a plurality of lateral openings (5e).  the  gasoline is located in a lower chamber (14) where the tu­ bes (5) are immersed.  the uper portion of the tubes are  not immersed in the gasoline.  when the motor is turned  on, the intake valve (4) opens and air is drawn through the  air filter (2) in the carburetor and down into the tubes (5).   the air contacts the wicks in the tubes (5), vapor is form­ ed, and passes through the openings (5e) thereof into a  chamber which has a protective material (7) located there­ in.  from this chamber, the vapors of gasoline pass into the  intake tube (9) and are metered by the butterfly valve (10)  for delivery to the manifold and distribution to the cyliners  of the engine.  there is also provided a valve (13) in proxi­ mity to the intake arrangement to insure the release of any  back pressure which develops during a backfire.  this valve  is designed to open automatically and release the pressure  so as to prevent damage within the carburetor.
