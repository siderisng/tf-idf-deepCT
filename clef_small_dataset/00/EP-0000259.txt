<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for aligning a transducer (2) in  a housing (1) forming part of a radiation generator in which  the optical or acoustic axis is made coincident with the  mechanical axis (5).  the alignment procedure comprises  reflecting a beam emitted by the transducer (2) from concentric  reflecting surfaces, (m₁, m₂) the common axis (9) of which  is rotated (8) around the mechanical axis (5) whilst  orthogonal (x, y, z) corrections to the transducer (1) position  are made in order to establish the position of maximum constant  reflectance.  these steps determine the focal position  (0).  the angular (αβ) position of the reflecting surfaces  (m₁, m₂) is then adjusted by rotation around the focal position  (0), again until a maximum constant reflection is obtained,  and because these surfaces (m₁, m₂) are coupled to a rotatable  support (4) enclosing the housing of the transducer (1)  the support (4) is repositioned accordingly.  the support (4) is  then secured to the housing (1).
