<ABSTRACT>
an aqueous emulsion or dispersion of a partly water-soluble  material is prepared in a two step process, a dispersion  of polymer particles containing one or more materials  having a very low solubility in water is prepared in the first  step and a partly water-soluble material is added in the second  step which diffuses into the polymer particles obtained  in the first step.  where the partly water-soluble material is a  polymerizable monomer, polymerization may be effected  after diffusion of the monomer into the polymer particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a process for preparing aqueous emulsions or dispersions of a partly water-soluble material or mixtures of partly water-soluble materials, and possibly further polymerisation when the partly water-soluble material is a monomer or a mixture containing one or more monomers. in u.s. patent specification no. 4,113,687, which discloses a process for preparing emulsions of somewhat water-soluble vinyl monomers, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to prepare stable emulsions of vinyl monomer by preparing in a first step an aqueous pre-emulsion of a material having a very low solubility in water, by an efficient homogenisation process, and then upon addition of water and emulsifier allowing the somewhat water-soluble vinyl monomer to diffuse into the droplets of the material having a very low solubility in water. the fact that the droplets in the pre-emulsion consisted of a material which combined very low water solubility and low molecular weight, had the effect that the droplets could absorb 50-500 times their own volume of the somewhat water-soluble vinyl monomer, with formation of stable dispersions which were subjected to polymerisation to form a latex. the pre-emulsion was in this case prepared by homogenisation, which leads to a broad distribution of the droplet size which became even broader after absorption of the vinyl monomer. in german offenlegungsschrift p27 51 867.8 there is disclosed the preparation of a dispersion of particles by ordinary emulsion polymerisation, but in contrast to ordinary polymer latexes, the particles contain a substantial fraction of oligomers having a much lower molecular weight. as a consequence of this the particles may take up 20-500 times their own volume of a somewhat water-soluble substance. in order to attain the formation of oligomers having low molecular weight by ordinary emulsion polymerisation there is used according to german offenlegungsschrift p27 51 867.8 an addition of chain transfer agent during the polymerisation, which causes the formation of shorter chains. both in the process described in u.s. patent specification no. 4,113,687 and in german offenlegungsschrift p27 51 867.8, there is obtained in a first step a pre-emulsion of particles which have the ability to take up a somewhat water-soluble material in an amount of 10-200 times more than corresponding polymer particles. by the method described in german offenlegungsschrift p27 51 867.8 one avoids the homogenisation of the substance having a very low solubility in water and having a low molecular weight, which is described in u.s. patent specification no. 4,113,687. further, the method disclosed in german offenlegungsschrift p27 51 867.8 provides greater possibilities for the preparation of more monodisperse droplets or particles with a predetermined size. a disadvantage of the method described in german offenlegungsschrift p27 51 867.8, is however, that the chain transfer agent which usually will be a mercaptan compound, is a badly smelling, slightly toxic compound with which it is unpleasant to work. further, addition thereof will often result in a reduction of the rate of polymerisation. it may also require that the chain transfer agent is added in portions

<CLAIMS>
a process for preparing an aqueous  emulsion or dispersion of a partly water-soluble  material characterized in that an aqueous dispersion  of polymer particles is prepared in a first  step containing from 0.05 to 10 times by volume, based on the polymer, of one or more materials having a  water-solubility of <10-2 g/l and having a molecular  weight of <5000 (herein referred to as  substance i) said substance i not being an oligomer of the polymer forming the particles and being non-crystalline at the temperature at which it is incorporated into the particles and is in liquid form at the temperature at which substance ii is introduced in a second step, and that in said second step the  partly water-soluble material, having a water-solubility  of at least ten times that of substance  i (herein referred to as substance ii) is  added under conditions which prevent or hinder  transport of substance i through the aqueous     phase, whereby substance ii diffuses into the  polymer particles swelled with substance i and increases the volume of said particles by from 20 to 1000 times, based on the polymer. a process as claimed in claim 1 wherein  the substance i has a water-solubility of <10-4  g/l. a process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,  wherein a substance i is added in the first step  to an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles or  to an aqueous dispersion of monomer or mixture  of monomers from which the polymer particles  are prepared in the presence of substance  i, under conditions which cause a substantial  increase in the rate of transport of substance  i through the aqueous phase to the polymer  particles which particles are thereby  swelled with substance i, and then  adding substance ii in the second step. a process as claimed in claim 3 wherein  the rate of transport of substance i through the  aqueous phase in the first step is increased by  preparing a finely divided aqueous emulsion of  substance i which is added to the dispersion of  polymer particles. a process as claimed in claim 3 wherein  the first step is effected in the presence of a  solvent which is soluble in water and is a  solvent for substance i; the solvent, if desired,  being removed after the first step. a process as claimed in any one of the  preceding claims, wherein a monomer is added  wholly or in part as substance ii which monomer  is polymerized after having diffused into the  swelled polymer particles. a process as claimed in claim 6, wherein a water-soluble initiator  is added after  the addition of monomer in the second step. a process as claimed in claim 6, wherein  an initiator having a water-solubility of <10-2  g/l is added dissolved in substance i in the first  step. a process as claimed in claim 8, wherein  a liquid initiator is used as substance i and also  serves as an initiator for the polymerisation of  monomer introduced in the second step. a process as claimed in claim 1, wherein  the dispersion of polymer particles of the first  step is prepared by homogenisation of a mixture  of a monomer, substance i and, if desired, an  oil-soluble initiator with water and emulsifier, to  obtain an emulsion of this mixture, then, if  desired, adding an initiator having a water-solubility  as defined in claim 8, and effecting the  polymerisation whereby a dispersion of polymer  particles containing 5-90 percent by volume  of substance i is obtained. a process as claimed in claim 10,  wherein a vinyl monomer is used as substance  ii and is polymerised after diffusing into the particles  prepared in the first step. a process as claimed in any of  claims 1 to 9 wherein a monodisperse  emulsion or dispersion is obtained.
