<ABSTRACT>
The motor (10), which entails the carriage (6) on the slide (4) via an endless chain transmission (7), is reversed in rotation by permutation of the food phases, when the Trolley (6), whose position is repeated by the potentiometer (12), reaches inverting setpoint positions fixed by the potentiometers (14 and 15). The motor (10) is equipped with a known type (23) of the known type to reduce the current at the start or inverted current, and which must be resolved so that the engine reaches its nominal regime . According to the invention, the motor (10) is selected such that its rated power corresponds to the one necessary to cause the reversal of the trolley stroke (6) coupled to the motor in a chosen time, and the means of Inversion (23) remains in service continuously, since the necessary power between the inversions is low. Under these conditions the engine can ensure thousands of inversions on time.
