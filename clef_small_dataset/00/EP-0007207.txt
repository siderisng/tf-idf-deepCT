<ABSTRACT>
although the method and apparatus of the present invention  can be utilized to apply either a uniform or a non-uniform  covering of material over many different workpieces, the  apparatus (20) is advantageously utilized to apply a thermal  barrier covering (64) to an airfoil (22) which is used in a turbine  engine.  the airfoil is held by a gripper assembly (86) while a  spray gun (24) is effective to apply the covering over the  airfoil.  when a portion of the covering has been applied, a  sensor (28) is utilized to detect the thickness of the covering.  a  control apparatus (32) compares the thickness of the covering  of material which has been applied with the desired thickness  and is subsequently effective to regulate the operation of the  spray gun to adaptively apply a covering of a desired thickness  with an accuracy of at least plus or minus 0. 0015 inches  (1. 5 mils) despite unanticipated process variations.
