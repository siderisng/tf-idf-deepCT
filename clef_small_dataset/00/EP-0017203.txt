<ABSTRACT>
The initial brake shoe (1) is provided with forward traveling is provided with clinches and is located thereof on guide rollers (2) of a carrier (3).On the carrier (3), the second brake shoe (5) is supported over a take-up (4).The other end of the second brake shoe (5) relies on forward travel to a stationary abutment (6).The first brake shoe (1) is provided at its end in the region of the abutment (6) with a driver (10), which at reverse drive the second brake back (5) and via the take-up (4) also the carrier (3) in the directionthe arrow r shifts.As a result, the carrier (3) is strongly spread against the brake current mel (9) and at tendency for reverse drive a very high braking force is achieved in this way.
