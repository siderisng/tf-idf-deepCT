<ABSTRACT>
in a method for the quantitative measurement of loss of water in buried conduits, a defined quantity of water is fed, over a particular period of time, into a pipeline section (1) which is blocked and provided with consumer branches, the water consumption is measured at the connection points of the consumer branches, and the difference between these two quantities of water is determined.  the arrangement which serves to carry out the method comprises a pipeline section (1) which is blocked by gate valves (14) and in which a hydrant (8) is provided which is connected via a line (9), in which a water meter (10) is arranged, to a further hydrant (7) provided in the operational mains.  the water meters (6) arranged in the consumer branches and the water meter (10) provided in the line (9) of the two hydrants (7,8) are equipped with a device for repeated recording of the meter status.  <image>
