<ABSTRACT>
in a desk with drawing-board, a fixedly installed horizontal working surface and a movably arranged drawing-board (2) are provided.  the drawing-board (2) is pivotable about a horizontal tilt axis located above the back edge of the working surface.  the drawing-board (2) can be locked in the vertical rest position shown in broken lines.  in the use position, shown in unbroken lines, the drawing-board (2) is inclined.  between the working surface and the drawing-board (2) there remains a free space (43) in which work material lying on the working surface can be located.  the back (30) of the drawing-board (2) is designed as a usable board surface, which is turned towards the working surface when the drawing-board (2) is in the rest position.  the desk is particularly suitable as a place for study.  the arrangement of the drawing-board (2) permits it to be used on both sides.  it is not necessary to clear the working surface prior to drawing work.  the desk is suitable for placing against a wall, since there are no rearwardly-projecting parts and the movement of the drawing-board from the front is easily possible.  <image>
