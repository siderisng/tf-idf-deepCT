<ABSTRACT>
a coating on an external rim (29) of a container (30)  to be closed by heat sealing a coated cover (19) onto the  rim (29) is heat-activated in a preheating stage (15) and  then the cover (19) is pressed onto the rim (29) whllst  applying heat to the cover (19) and/or rim (29) so that the  coatings on the rim and cover are sealed together.  the  preheating (15) preferably is with hot air whilst the rim  (29) is supported on a support frame (31) which prefer­ ably is also heated.  the invention has particular applica­ tion to cardboard containers of food requiring cooking by  the consumer and permits the use of surlyn cover coat­ ings (47) with polyester rim coatings (48) for such con­ tainers (30).  in the surlyn/polyester combination, it is  preferred that the cover (19) and rim (29) are only pres­ sed together at a plurality of discrete locations so that  polyester is squeezed into intermediate areas allowing  surlyn to penetrate the cardboard layer (46) of the rim  (29) at the pressing locations.
