<ABSTRACT>
a linear electric motor comprises a hollow cylindrical  frame 11 of magnetizable material, an elongated armature  20 provided with a permanent magnet 21 having a pair of  magnetic poles 22, 23 supported for linear axial movement  in the frame, and a stationary winding 30 circumposing the  armature 20, the winding comprising a pair of coils 32, 33  wound on a pair of axially spaced bobbins 42, 43 secured  to the frame.  the bobbins supporting the coils are dispos­ ed adjacent to respective end portions 13, 14 of the frame  serving as stationary poles.  each coil circumposes a re­ spective pole piece secured to an end of the magnet 21  and each of the coils is disposed between one of the mag­ netic poles and the frame.  energization of the coils of the  stationary winding exerts a force on the coils with respect  to the armature resulting in linear motion of the armature.
