<ABSTRACT>
the cosine correction factor of a receiver for compatible  am stereo reception is controlled by the amount of high  frequency energy present in the demodulated signal.  large  amounts of such energy indicate a low signal-to-noise ratio  and cosine correction under such conditions is then not  desirable.  during periods of excessive high frequency energy,  a filter circuit output causes a switching circuit to remove  the derived cosine correction factor and cause division of the  demodulated signal by a factor of one instead.  the output of  a cosine phase detector (24) is coupled to a divider (25)  through the switching circuit (27).  the output of the detector  (24) is also coupled to a high pass filter (29), an output of  which is coupled to a first control input of the switching  circuit (27).  a second control input (30) provides a reference  signal.  when the s/n ratio of the received signal is low and  thus the output of a limiter, which contains only the phase  information of the received signal, contains large amounts of  high frequency energy, the high pass filter (29) provides to  the switching circuit (27), a control voltage sufficient to  disconnect the output of the detector (24) from the divider  (25) and to substitute therefor the reference voltage which is  such as to cause the divider (25) to effectively divide the  demodulated signal (l-r) cos âŠ˜ signal by a factor of one.
