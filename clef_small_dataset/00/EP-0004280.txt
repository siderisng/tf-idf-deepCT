<ABSTRACT>
a deck container restraint system is disclosed which  utilizes discrete containers against vertical movement in  modules of three-wide, typically four-high stacks or columns  to prevent overboard loss due to static and dynamic  load conditions experienced at sea.  a three-wide, one-high  bottom tier of containers is secured against side to side  and vertical movement by deck cones having locking devices.   the overlying three-wide second tier is secured  against side to side and vertical movement by cones having  locking devices at the top of the first tier.  finally the three-wide,  two-high top third and fourth tiers of containers are  loaded, first by being tied vertically together by cones  having locking devices and second, by being lifted in vertically  tied pairs onto stacking fittings at the second-third  tier interface.  the stacking fittings restrain side to side  movement at the second-third tier interface only.  upon  completion of placement of the third and fourth tier, an  equalizing spreader fits over the top of the three-wide, four-high  container columns or stacks, restraining relative vertical  and horizontal movement between the corners of  adjacent containers.  by providing for remote fastening of  the equalizer to the top of the three-wide, four-high module,  container restraint against dynamic loadings commonly  experienced at sea can occur without conventional horizontal  or vertical ties.  provision is made to expand the  module to container columns on either side of additional  equalizer spreaders are used.
