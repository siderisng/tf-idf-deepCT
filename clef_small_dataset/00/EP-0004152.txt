<ABSTRACT>
a recurring analog signal is digitized by repeatedly  comparing it to a reference level, or to several reference  levels, during each signal occurrence to determine where the  signal has a value related to each reference level.  the reference  level, or levels, are changed between signal occurrences  but remain constant during each occurrence.  digitization  is completed after several occurrences of the signal have  been analyzed in this manner.
