<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for washing running length  textile fabric in open width, in which fabric (f) advances  generally upwardly through a washing chamber (a, aâ€²) and  along a sinuous path having a plurality of substantially  planar runs inclined at an angle to the horizontal while wash  water cascades downwardly on the fabric.  the wash water  cascades from one to another of a plurality of trays (30) in  such a manner as to bring fabric being washed into contact  with progressively cleaner water as the fabric is being  progressively cleaned.
