<ABSTRACT>
a heating and/or cooling module (1) for use in an  underfloor heating and/or cooling system and system  comprising such modules.  each module comprises a  continuous length of plastics tubing (2) laid in a serpen­ tine configuration on a thermally conductive support (3)  for the passage of water through the tubing.  the tubing  (2) and support (3) are prefabricated as a portable unit  which, because the support is flexible, can be folded  about an axis parallel to the length of the tubing.  the  tubing (2) has an internal bore which is sufficiently small  to prevent air from becoming trapped in the tubing.  the  tubing (2) and support (3) may be encapsulated in a  flexible envelope to accomodate expansion and contrac­ tion movements.

<DESCRIPTION>
modules for underfloor heating and/or cooling systems description this invention relates to heating and/or cooling modules for use in underfloor heating and/or cooling systems, for example in homes, schools, offices, hospitals, etc. one known form of under floor central heating system comprises an electric heating cable, consisting of an electric heating wire sheathed in a plastics tube, which is embedded in a screed of concrete forming a floor of a building. another form of underfloor central heating system comprises a tube, made either of metal or a plastics material, which is embedded in a concrete screed as the floor is built and through which heated water is passed. in both these known systems, the concrete screed in which the heating cable or heated water tube is embedded forms a large storage-type heating system. however, these known systems suffer from a major disadvantage, particularly in the installation thereof, in that the heating cable or heated water tube is laid on a sub-floor from a reel or coil during installation, thus resulting in high labour costs, and requiring considerable care and skill on the part of the persons installing the system. ele concrete srreed is ssseyuerrtli poured over the sub-floor. in other systems there is usually a need for anchor points embedded in the subfloor, thus weakening the effectiveness of the dampproof membrane at these points. long runs of such piping also tend to give off heat, metre by metre of length, thus causing inequalities in flow temperature with diminishing temperatures towards the end of the run. other systems are known, based upon the use of sinuous pipes, but primarily for installation in walls, where the problems and requirements are different from those of an underfloor system. one such example is described in uk patent specification no. 536390. it is an object of the present invention to provide a modular system which can be completel prefabricated, which is portable, and which can easily be transported to the site for installation. it is another object of the present invention to provide a module which by virtue of its construction is extremely easy to handle and to manoeuvre in restricted access conditions. it is a further object to provide a module which overcomes the problem of air-locks which, particularly in an underfloor system with long runs of substantially horizontal pipe, can be especially troublesome with known systems which use relatively large bore pipes. it is yet another object of the invention to provide a modular system which enables one substantially to equalise the flow temperature of the water to ensure an even dispersal of floor temperature. in accordance with the present invention there is provided a heating and/or cooling module for use in an underfloor heating and/or cooling system, the module comprising conduit means arranged in a serpentine configuration for the passage of a heating or cooling liquid therethrough, and thermally conductive support means for the conduit means both to support the conduit means and to dissipate heat therefrom, characterised in that the conduit

claims:    1. a heating and/or cooling module for use in an underfloor heating and/or cooling system, the module comprising conduit means arranged in a serpentine configuration for the passage of a heating or cooling liquid therethrough, and thermally conductive support means for the conduit means both to support the conduit means and to dissipate heat therefrom, characterised in that the conduit means and support means are prefabricated as a portable unit adapted to be laid as a unit on a flooring surface, the support means is flexible to enable the complete unit to fold about an axis parallel to the lengths of the conduit means, and the conduit means is a continuous length of plastics tubing with an internal bore which is sufficiently small to prevent air from becoming trapped within the tubing during the passage of the liquid therethrough.    2. a module as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the tubing has an internal bore of the order of 7 mm diameter.    3. a module as claimed in claim 1 or 2, including means to accommodate expansion and contraction of the tubing, characterised in that said means comprises a flexible envelope within which the tubing and the support means are encapsulated.    4. a module as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the envelope comprises a wire-reinforced sheet of plastics material.    5. a module as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the envelope is such that when the module is buried by the flooring material the envelope is pressed into intimate contact with the tubing around a major sector of the tube circumference and pockets of air are trapped in the region of the minor sector of the tube circumference.     6. a module as claimed in any preceding claim,  characterised in that the support means comprises a metal wire mesh on to which the tubing is secured in intimate contact therewith.    7. a heating and /or cooling system comprising a plurality of modules as claimed in any preceding claim buried in an under floor system, characterised in that the modules are connected to flow and return pipes as a set in parallel or as a number of sub-sets with the modules in parallel in each sub-set.    8. a system as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that there are two modules in each sub-set.
