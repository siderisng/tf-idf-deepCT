<ABSTRACT>
textile materials formed of polyester or nylon  fibers having improved durable soil release and moisture  transport characteristics are provided by application to  the textile material of at least about 0. 001 to about 10  weight per cent of a cellulose acetate polymeric constituent  having a degree of substitution of the acetyl moiety  of from about 0. 9 to about 2. 3.  such a cellulose acetate  polymeric constituent is represented by the formula    wherein x is an integer of at least 50, n is an integer of  from about 2. 1 to about 0. 7, and the expression 3-n is the  degree of substitution of the acetyl moiety in a solvent.   in the process for producing same, the cellulose acetate  polymeric constituent can be applied to the fabric from  a pad bath containing the polymeric constituent and a  solvent capable of solubilizing the polymeric constituent,  by exhaustion techniques during the dyeing of the textile  material, or by exhaustion techniques from an aqueous  admixture containing finely dispersed particles of the  cellulose acetate polymeric constituent.
