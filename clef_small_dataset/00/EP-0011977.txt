<ABSTRACT>
a forming fabric for making an endless belt for a paper­ making machine is produced by first weaving a length of  conventional fabric with warp yarns (10) extending from each  of its two ends.  a selected number of the extended warps (10)  are then cut at each end so that each cut warp (10a) is adjacent  a remaining extending warp, and loops (14, 14′) are formed  from the remaining extending warps at the ends of the fabric.   the ends of the looped warps are woven back through fills  (12) of the fabric to a position near the cut warps (10a) and to  provide tail ends (20) of the looped warps projecting from the  surface of the fabric.  the fabric is made into an endless belt by  joining its two ends, and this is done by interleaving the loops  (14, 14′) of the two ends (a,b) inserting a joining pin (18)  through the interleaved loops (14, 14′), and pulling the project­ ing tail ends (20) of the looped warps to tighten the loops  around the joining pin and draw the ends of the fabric  together.
