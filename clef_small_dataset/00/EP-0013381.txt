<ABSTRACT>
the aim is to improve cooling in reflector lighting fixtures for high-pressure lamps having a protective glass cover on the reflector.  a holder that is attached to the lighting fixture housing is provided for the high-pressure lamp.  this lighting fixture housing is subdivided by a transverse partition wall (5) into an upper chamber and into a lower chamber (4).  the holder (8) is attached to the underside of this partition wall (5) mentioned above.  the holder (8) projects with its free end into the end region of the chamber (4), which has ventilation slits (7), and penetrates the latter along its length.  the opening (14) of the reflector (12), accommodating the free end of the holder (8), carries a seal (15) bearing on the outside against the holder (8).  <image>
