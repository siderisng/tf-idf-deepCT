<ABSTRACT>
a facsimile receiver having means for receiving signals  and having writing means for writing on a copy medium on a  rotatable drum 110, further includes a modulator means  (130, 159) for generating a signal transmission to a remotely  located transmitter during predetermined intervals in which  received signals are absent.  the signal from the receiver  provides a periodic handshake function.  the duration of the  signal is short compared with the duration of the predetermined  intervals.  the receiver is thus able to participate in  handshake signalling without necessitating reduction of the  bandwidth available for facsimile transmission.
