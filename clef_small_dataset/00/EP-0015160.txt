<ABSTRACT>
in an oil-filled electric power cable installation, the oil is  pressurised using oil tanks (13) connected to stop joints (11) in  the usual way, and an oil-purifying unit is connected between  stop joint and tank.  the oil-purifying unit comprises a column  or bed (1) of a molecular sieve or other active purifying agent  with particle sizes, and interstice sizes, big enough to limit the  pressure drop across the unit to 20 kn/mÂ² at the most.  this  eliminates the need to provide bypass passages controlled by  valves as the oil can flow both ways through the column.
