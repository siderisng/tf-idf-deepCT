<ABSTRACT>
acid gases such as co₂ and h₂s are scrubbed from a gas  mixture in an absorption zone (2) employing an aqueous  solution (22) comprising an alkali metal compound and a  sterically hindered amine of formula: r-nh₂-(ch₂)m-nh₂ in  which r is a secondary or tertiary alkyl or cycloalkyl c₄ to c₂₀  hydrocarbon group and m is from 2 to 5, under elevated  temperature and pressure causing the formation of a cyclic  urea of formula:    in which r is a secondary or tertiary c₄ to c₂₀ alkyl or cycloalkyl  hydrocarbon and m is from 0 to 3.  the solution containing  absorbed acid gases is steam stripped in a regeneration zone  (6, 8) and a portion of the resulting lean solution is cooled (in  19) to a temperature at which the cyclic urea selectively pre­ cipitates.  the cooled portion of the solution is passed through  a filter (16 or 17) to separate the cyclic urea solids before being  recirculated (23) with the rest (21) of the lean solution to the  absorption zone (2).
