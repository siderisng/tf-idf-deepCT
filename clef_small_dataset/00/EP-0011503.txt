<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a circuit for adjusting the high  and low spin speeds of a machine.  the motor speed is  adjusted by phase angle control circuit which receives an  adjustable d. c.  signal from the output 37 of the circuit shown  in figure 2.  during normal washing, only switch 29 is closed provid­ ing a first d. c.  level at output 37.  during slow speed spinning  switch 24 is closed to provide a second d. c.  level at output 37  variable by resistor 40.  at high speed the switch 43 is addi­ tionally closed to provide a third d. c.  level variable by resistor  42.  the resistors 40 and 42 are preferably ganged to simplify  operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
"device for controlling the speed of a washing machine motor the present invention relates to a device for controlling the speed of a washing machine motor. the motor speed controllers currently being fitted on washing machines are of the solid-state type and have a number of advantages over traditional electromechanical designs. one of the most outstanding of these advantages is the versatility they afford as regards the functions that can be performed. thanks to the introduction of solid-state controllers, machines can be made to perform a number of functions which were simply unobtainable at one time. one of the many functions a washing machine is called upon to perform is spinning at the end of the washing operation. this spinning operation is performed on known machines in a variety of different ways. some perform only one type of spinning operation at a single speed regardless of the type of load being washed. others spin at variable speeds or with two independent spinning cycles - low speed (about 400 revs/min of the drum) and high speed (about 800 revs/min) - actuated one after the other by the timer on the machine. in the case of the latter system, the load is practically dry after high-speed spinning. nevertheless, for best spinning results, provision should be made for adjusting the speed of both the high-speed and low-speed operation to the type of load being washed. depending on the thickness of the items being washed, spinning speed should be neither too high (to avoid creasing) nor too low (to prevent the load still being wet after spinning). it is also important to be able to adjust both speeds during both spinning cycles (high and low speed) as creasing also depends on how fast the low-speed spinning operation is performed. adjustment of both spinning speeds must therefore be left to the user of the machine and made as simple as possible. the aim of the present invention is therefore to enable adjustments to be made to washing machine motor speeds for high-and low-speed spinning operations. a further aim of the present invention is to enable both speeds to be adjusted simply and cheaply. according to the present invention, there is provided a device for controlling the speed of a washing machine motor, comprising a regulation element for regulating the speed of the motor in dependence upon a control signal and a circuit for generating the control signal, the latter circuit including a reference signal generating circuit, characterised in that the reference signal generating circuit is operative to generate a first or second type of signal according to whether the motor is to be run at a speed within an acceptable first or second range, and that control means are provided for continuous adjustment of the said first and second type of reference signal so as to provide for continuous control of motor speed within each of the first and second acceptable ranges. a detailed description will now be given with reference to the attached drawings,
