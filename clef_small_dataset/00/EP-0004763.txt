<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle steering locking mechanism comprises a toothed annulus (18) having, for example, eighteen teeth, which is keyed to the steering shaft.  the annulus (18) is contained within a housing (10) which fits on the steering column and a bearing (17) within the housing (10) supports the steering shaft.  a bolt (22) is movable under the action of a spring (23) into engagement with the annulus (18) in a direction parallel to the axis of the steering shaft.  retraction of the bolt (22) is effected by means of a cam (27) coupled to a key-operated device (35).
