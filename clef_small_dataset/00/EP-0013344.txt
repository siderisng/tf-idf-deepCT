<ABSTRACT>
the circuit receives the input signals at the terminals (12) to (18) of the bases of the input transistors (20) to (26).  when no high- level signal is applied to the input terminals, none of the input transistors is conductive.  the line (28) is practically at the level of the power source v.  subsequently, the clamping transistor (48) is blocked and the output transistor (40) conducts, so that the output terminal (42) is at a high level.  if one of the input terminals is at a high level, the voltage in the line (28) falls, but is maintained by the clamping transistor (48) at a level such that none of the input transistors is saturated.  the transistor (40) being mounted in transmitter-follower mode, the output terminal (42) is at the low level.  the transistors (40) and (48) cannot be saturated at any time.  the circuit therefore has a high switching speed and can be produced as an integrated circuit on a small area.  <image>
