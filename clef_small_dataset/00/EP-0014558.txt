<ABSTRACT>
this invention is a means for assembling an electrical  component in a casing (28) which in use generates enough  heat to require a heat sink (26) on a printed circuit board (10).   the casing (28) is mounted on studs (20) swaged into the base  of the heat sink (26) and having projecting heads (25) which  are tinned and fit in holes (35) in the board (10) so that the  exposed ends can be soldered to the printed conductive  pattern to hold the heat sink and component assembled with  the board.

<DESCRIPTION>
heat sink mounting this invention relates to heat sink mountings and one object is to provide a simple and yet efficient way of mounting on a printed circuit board an electrical component such as a semi-conductor device which generates sufficient heat in use to require to be assembled with a heat sink. a heat sink is merely a body of thermally conductive material for example, copper or aluminium, which may include fins, which is in intimate contact with the heat generating device and which provides a substantial surface area for transmission of heat to the surrounding air. printed circuit boards tend to have a number of components assembled with them, and electrically connected to the printed circuit by soldering, and it has been usual to connect up those components which do not generate much heat by a conventional wave soldering operation. then it has been usual to clean and trim the board and inspect it and then mount semi-conductor,devices and the like with their heat sinks in separate manual operations with separate nuts or other connections passing through the circuit board after which the leads from the components are soldered to the printed circuit and cleaning,#trimming and inspection is repeated. according to one aspect of the present invention, an electrical component and a heat sink assembly is mounted on a printed circuit board by at least one stud which is secured at one end of the printed circuit board, and serves to hold the component assembled with the heat sink. the securing is conveniently by soldering the exposed end of the stud to the printed circuit, and for that purpose that part of the stud, at least can be plated with a suitable soldering metal. the stud can be a force fit in a corresponding hole in the heat sink, or can be otherwise assembled with it, and then the exposed end of the stud can be used for assembling the component with the heat sink, perhaps by use of threads on the stud and a co-operating nut, while the one end of the stud serves to hold the assembly of heat sink stud and component to the printed circuit board. an advantage is that assembly with the board is merely by soldering the exposed end of the stud to the printed circuit, and that can be done in the same machine operation as is used.for connecting other non-heat generating electrical components to the printed circuit. the stud conveniently has a flange serving to space the heat sink from the printed circuit board, and that can as thick as the desired space and sufficient in diameter merely to engage the facing surfaces of the heat sink and the board. if a large space is required, then there may be a stand-off shank between the flange and the one end of the stud which is effectively an elongation of the flange. according to the second aspect of the invention a heat sink suitable for carrying an electrical component is assembled with
