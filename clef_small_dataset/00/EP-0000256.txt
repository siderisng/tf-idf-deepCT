<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method of cleaning teeth by  applying thereto one or more elements selected from  yttrium, scandium and lanthanum and the lanthanides, and  to compositions, such as mouthwashes, toothpastes and  dental gels, for use in such a method.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to dental hygiene, and more particularly it relates to a method of cleaning teeth. it is known that a wide variety of elemental cations, including those derived from gallium, yttrium, lead, indium, beryllium, cerium, dysprosium, iron, arsenic, thorium, iridium, rubidium, vanadium, zirconium, titanium, tin, thallium, aluminium, copper, ruthenium, gold, samarium, rhodium, mercury, lithium, cobalt, lanthanum, uranium, zinc, barium, caesium, strontium, calcium, cadmium and chromium, reduce the acid solubility of tooth enamel in an in vitro test system (r. s. manly and b. g. bibby, j. dent. res., 1949, 28, 160―171 ). it is also known that tooth enamel may be remineralised by sequential application to the teeth of a cationic and an anionic component which react below the tooth surface to form an insoluble salt. examples of the cationic component are ions derived from barium, lanthanum, manganese, lead, tin, zinc, indium, zirconium, iron, titanium, vanadium and cadmium (uk patent specification no. 1,452,125, equivalent to french patent no. 2,202,697). french patent no. 997,488 states that caries can be prevented by using an oxidising solution containing a metallic catalyst derived from iron, copper, manganese, zinc, silver or one of the 14 rare earth elements. this patent contains no examples. it has been found that administration of yttrium nitrate to rats, either by intraperitoneal injection or via the drinking water, reduces the incidence of caries and this effect has been attributed to the incorporation of yttrium into the dental enamel, thus reducing its acid solubility. (r. castillo mercado and t. g. ludwig, arch. oral. biol., 1973, 18, 637―640). it has also been found that mouthrinsing with a stannous fluoride solution reduces plaque formation on tooth enamel (n. tinanoff, j. m. brady, and a. gross, caries res., 1976, 10, 415―126; n. tinanoff, j. dent. res., 1977, 56, spec. issue a, a138). it has now been discovered, and herein lies our invention, that deposits such as dental plaque may be removed from the surface of teeth, or may be prevented from adhering thereto, by application of the lanthanum cation. the invention consists of the use of a salt of lanthanum for the manufacture of a non-oxiding aqueous composition for cleaning plaque and for stains from human teeth which consists essentially of the unbound cation of the element lanthanum in the form of a water soluble salt and in free of any ingredients which precipitates the cation as a water-insoluble salt. the invention is particularly useful for cleaning teeth in human beings. the efficient cleaning of teeth is, of course, of immense cosmetic value. one of the substances routinely found on the surface of teeth is bacterial plaque and the method of this invention is particularly useful in removing plaque from teeth or in preventing its adhering thereto. the method of the invention is also useful in removing various types of stain from teeth, for example the stain produced by smoking tobacco. in addition bacterial plaque is generally regarded as a dominant etiological factor in caries and periodontal disease and removal of plaque

<CLAIMS>
1. the use of a salt of lanthanum for the manufacture of a non-oxidising  aqueous composition for cleaning plaque  and/or stains from human teeth which consists essentially of the unbound  cation of the element lanthanum in the form of a water-soluble salt and is  free of any ingredients which precipitate the cation as a water-insoluble  salt. 2. the use of lanthanum chloride for the use claimed in claim 1.
