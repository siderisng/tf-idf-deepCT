<ABSTRACT>
1.  a high-pressure rapid connection coupling for connecting fibre extinguishing hoses or the like to faucets of pressurized water pipes, said coupling comprising : a) a funnel-shaped hose connecting piece (11) with a hose fitting piece (13) at the smaller opening and with an outwardly bent rim (14) at the larger opening : b) an elastic sealing element (15) having an elastic membrane (16) covering the larger opening of the hose connecting piece (11) and having an outer torus (17) provided with an annular groove (18) open inwardly in a radial direction, with said rim (14) of said hose connecting piece (11) engaging in said annular groove, wherein the membrane (16) is provided with a central orifice (19) having a diameter smaller than the smallest diameter of the faucet outlets to be held therein ; characterized by the following features : c) the edge of the central orifice (19) merges into a tube piece (20) projecting in an apronlike manner into the interior of the hose connecting piece (11), with the wall thickness and opening width thereof decreasing from the outside to the inside ; d) a reinforcing element (21), comprising a disc (22) with a central orifice, an outer cylindrical collar (23) and a lip (24) projecting radially inward from said cylindrical collar, covers the membrane (16) on its outer face with the disc (22) and embraces the torus (17) by means of the outer peripheral edge portion of said disc (22), the cylindrical collar (23) and the lip (24) projecting radially inward from said cylindrical collar.
