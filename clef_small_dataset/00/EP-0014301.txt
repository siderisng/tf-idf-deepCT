<ABSTRACT>
the invention refers to a level measuring device suitable  for measuring the level of any substance, advantageously but  not necessarily dangerous substances whether due to heat,  toxicity or others, with or without anti-oxidization superficial  layers, including in mutual cooperation and coordination:   an intense light source (17) illuminating a limited and  restricted area (21) on the surface (12) of the medium whose  level (a-b-c) is to be measured;   a receiver-perceptor (24) processor (14-16) so arranged that at  least part of the optical control axis (120) is at an angle in  relation to the incidence optical axis (20) of said light source  (17),   therebeing advantageously present one or more regulating  means (67-70-41-42) responsive to the ambiental light and to  the possible infrared rays or other types, regulating means  (44) responsive to absorption and reflection features of the  rays (20-120) by the material of the surface (12) and the  medium in which the rays (20-120) propagate, alarm means  (38-57-77) and regulation means (27-33-45-51-55Â­ -56-70-76-64).
