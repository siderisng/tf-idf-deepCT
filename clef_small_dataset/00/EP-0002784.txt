<ABSTRACT>
a variable air flow oven (10) is disclosed in which a  variable air directing control means (70) delivers varying  amounts of heated air under various positive pressures in  an alternating pattern to jet orifices (60) in opposite side  walls (54) of the oven in an inverse ratio.  hot air jets from  opposite sides of the oven meet at points of common  velocity in the processing chamber to produce a turbulent  mixing of the hot air in a vertical plane.  the turbulent heated  air travels from one side of the oven to the other ad a  controlled rate under the controlled operation of a motor  (72) driven mechanical linkage arrangement (92) to assure  even baking, cooking or drying of the products being  processed through the entire processing chamber in the  oven.  the system operates at a positive pressure at all  times, so that the main supply of heated air flows through  one side duct and a smaller volume of heated air flows  through the opposite side.  as the air pressure is varied to  the hot air jets in the opposite side walls, the vertical plane  of turbulent heated air sweeps back and forth through the  chamber, contacting the entire product, and then is drawn  into a return duct (64) for reheating and recirculation.
