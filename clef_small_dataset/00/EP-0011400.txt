</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
description "an aminoglycosidic antibiotic salt" this invention relates to an aminoglycosidic antibiotic salt with educed toxicity. aminoglycosidic antibiotics such as dibekacin (3', tobramycin(3|-deoxyranamycin b), 4'-dideoxykanamycin b))/gentamicln, kanamycin bekanamycin (kanamycin b), amikacin and neomycin are widely used as antibacterial agents which are very effective for clinical treatment of the infections caused by gram-positive, gram-negative and acid-fast bacteria. however, it has been reported that these antibiotics, when administered to patients suffering from renal failure or other diseases, may induce disorders in the auditory organ or kidney, and as a result, such antibiotics have found only limited utility in clinical applications. thus, an agent for reducing the disorders in the auditory organ and kidney induced by aminoglycosidic antibiotics or an aminoglycosidic antibiotic with reduced toxicity has long been desired. as a result of studies into the possibility of reducing the toxicity of aminoglycosidic antibiotics, it has now been found that a d-glucaro-1,5-lactam salt of an aminoglycosidic antibiotic produced by having d-glucaro-1,5-lactam act upon the aminoglycosidic antibiotic is less toxic than the aminoglycosidic antibiotic per se accordingly, the invention resides in one aspect in an aminoglycosidic antibiotic salt comprising an aminoglycosidic antibiotic associated with d-glucaro-l, 5-lactam. in a further aspect, the invention resides in an anti-microbial pharmaceutical composition including, as a main ingredient, a salt of aminoglycosidic antibiotic and d-glucaro-l, 5-lactam in such an amount that the salt exhibits the intended antibiotic effect but has reduced toxicity as compared with the aminoglycosidic antibiotic per se. d-glucaro-1,5-lactam having the following formula: emi3.1 is already disclosed in japanese patent publication 28,375/70. as its formula suggests, the d-glucaro-1, 5-lactam has a strong carboxylic acid group which renders it acidic and, therefore, it reacts readily with the amino group of an aminoglycosidic antibiotic in a solution and forms a salt. to be more specific, an addition of a d-glucaro-1,5-lactam aqueous or watercontaining methanol solution to an aminoglycoside aqueous or water-containing methanol solution results in immediate formation of a salt thereof at room temperature. the salt may also be produced by having a calcium or barium salt of d-glucaro-1,5-lactam act on an aminoglycoside sulfate and removing the calcium or barium sulfate precipitated. the amount of the d-glucaro-1,5-lactam added varies with the number of the amino groups of the aminoglycoside and with the ph of the solution of the resulting salt, 2 to 5 moles of the lactam generally being used per mol of the aminoglycoside. the molar ratio of the lactam to glycoside should be relatively large for aminoglycosidic antibiotics having 5 to 6 amino groups such as dibekacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, bekanamycin and neomycin, whereas the ratio should be relatively small for aminoglycosidic antibiotics having 4 amino groups such as kanamycin a and amikacin. an increased amount of d-glucal -1,5-lactam is necessary for preparing a weak acidic salç within the pharmaceutically acceptable ph values and hence the molar ratio of the lactam to glycoside is not necessarily an integer. one reason for the variation in the molar ratio of the lactam to glycoside is that an aminoglycoside in the
