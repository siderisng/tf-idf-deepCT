<ABSTRACT>
an emergency flotation assembly for a helicopter comprises inflatable tubular float members attached to the helicopter skids which when inflated operate to keep the craft afloat while on the surface of a body of water.  each float is attached to the craft by a fabric flange or flanges extending from the float surface and secured to each horizontally disposed skid structure.  each float is further stabilized by connecting other surface portions of the float, peripherally spaced from the location of the fabric flanges, to a sleeve which is slidably mounted on each of the struts of the craft extending between the skids and the body of the craft.
