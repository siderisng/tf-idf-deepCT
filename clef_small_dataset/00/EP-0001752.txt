<ABSTRACT>
an improved pivot joint (10a) has a rotatable and tiltable  stud (12a).  a rotational preload force is applied to the stud  (12a) by a bearing (16a) which is circumferentially stressed in  tension to apply a clamping force to the stud (12a).  this  clamping force resists rotation of the stud (12a) relative to a  housing (14a) until a predetermined minimum rotational  force is applied to the stud (12a).  a tilting or sidewise preload  force is applied to the stud (12a).  a tilting or sidewise preload  force is applied to the stud (12a) by a resiliently compressible  bushing (18a) which is disposed between the bearing (16a)  and the housing (14a).  since the tilting preload force is  applied to the stud (12a) by the bushing (18a), the bearing  (16a) can be designed to provide an optimum rotational preload  force without regard to tilting preload force design considerations.   similarly, the bushing (18a) can be designed to  provide optimum tilting preload forces without regard to  design considerations influenced by the rotational preload  forces.  the pivot joint (10a) is advantageously assembled by  resiliently expanding the bearing (16a), moving the stud  (12a) into alignment with the bearing (16a) then releasing the  bearing (16a) so that it contracts part way back to its initia  condition.  the diameter of the stud surface (26a) engaged by  the bearing (16a) is large enough so that the bearing (16a)  cannot fully retract back to its initial condition.  this results in  tension stresses being set up in the bearing (16a) so that it  applies a clamping force against the stud (12a) to hold it  against rotation.  the bearing (16a) is provided with stop  means (112) which limit sideward tilting movement of the  stud (12a).
