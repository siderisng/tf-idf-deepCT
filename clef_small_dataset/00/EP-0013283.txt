<ABSTRACT>
in a turning machine or the like an apparatus for simul­ taneous axial and radial profiling of work includes circumfe­ rential profiling means (16,18) rotatably mounted on a spindle  (s) and a carriage support (14) mounted on the machine adja­ cent the spindle (s), a movable tool support carrier (40) on the  carriage support (14) movable parallel to the spindle axis, a  tool holder (44) mounted in the tool support carrier (40) for  movement parallel to and radially of the spindle axis and the  tool holder (44) including longitudinal profiling means (48)  and including tracking means (20,22) mounted between the  circumferential profiling means (16,18) and the longitudinal  profiling means (48) for simultaneously tracking both of the  profiling means.  the apparatus has at least two different patterns includ­ ing, a first set of cooperating circumferential and longitudinal  profiling means for forming a first control pattern, a second  set of cooperating circumferential and longitudinal profiling  means for forming a second controled pattern, means for  operatively connection the first and second sets of profiling  means with the tool (t), and means for positioning said first  set of profiling means relative to the second set of profiling  means whereby when the work (w) is rotated and the tool (t)  moved into engagement therewith, the work (w) is profiled  with at least two said different patterns according to the posi­ tioning of said first and second sets of cooperating circumfe­ rential profiling means.
