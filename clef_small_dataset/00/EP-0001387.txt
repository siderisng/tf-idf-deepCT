<ABSTRACT>
1.  tap-changing switch with a load diverter switch (2) sitting in a cylindrical housing and with a tap selector (4), which is arranged there-under and which is actuable by an intermittent gear (3) arranged between load diverter switch housing and tap selector, and with at least one annular screening (5) arranged externally on the load diverter switch housing for evening out the electric field emanating from the potential-carrying parts of the load diverter switch, characterised thereby, that the annular screening is laid as helix (7) around the load diverter switch housing (2) as well as around the intermittent gear (3), wherein at least one end (11, 13) of the helix is connected to the potential of the star point (12) in the case of three-phase tap-changing switches or to the grounding (12) in the case of single-phase tap-changing switches.
