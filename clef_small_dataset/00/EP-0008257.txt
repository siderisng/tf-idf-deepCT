<ABSTRACT>
1.  a valve intended for operation in the presence of a fluid liable to form condensate, comprising chamber b, a, a', at least one b of which has condensate to evacuate therefrom, and provided to this end with a device for recovering condensates 2, said chambers b, a, a' depending on the pressure in each of them being at least temporarily separable and/or isolatable from one another by closing means such as a closure 1 carried by a diaphragm 4, said valve being characterized in that the device for recovering condensates 2 is secured to the closing means 1, 4 and comprises a body 21 and flap valve members 22, 23, 24 each housed within a cavity 221, 231, 241 in the body, said cavities 221, 231, 241 communicating with one another through a throat 251 hollowed out in the body 21 and connected by respective conduits 222, 232, 242, each opening at their lower portion to one of said chambers b, a, a', said flap valve means 22, 23, 24 preventing communication between the cavities 221, 231, 241 and the respective conduits 222, 232, 242 in the absence of condensate to remove, in such way that when the condensate level in the conduit 222, connected to chamber b from which condensate must be removed, reaches a predetermined height, pressure resulting from the condensate high level lifts the flap valve means 22 lying in the respective cavity 221 and permits introduction of condensate into the cavities 221, 231, 241 and the throat 251 in the body 21, and that when the level of condensate reaches a fixed height in the body 21, the force resulting from archimedes' principle makes the flap valve means 23, 24, float in the cavity 231, 241 connected to the chamber a, a' in which pressure in higher, thereby causing removal of the condensate from said chamber a, a'.
