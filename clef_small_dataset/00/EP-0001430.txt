<ABSTRACT>
the equipment is intended to assist particularly school beginners, who are not yet well versed in reading and writing, as a line indicator for finding and refinding the correct line which is to be read or which is to be copied, that is to say it is used as a reading and writing aid.  unlike known copyholders, which are to be mounted at fixed work stations, the equipment is easily transportable; it has a spring clip (1) suitable for clipping onto the edge of a booklet, book, book cover or other item having lines, and this clip (1) is designed as a carrying part for an indicator carrier (9) moving on the clip, and preferably displaceable upwards and downwards, on which in turn a line indicator (10) is supported, can be adjusted to various angle positions, and can preferably be latched.  <image>   <image>
