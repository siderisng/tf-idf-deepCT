<ABSTRACT>
a building or partitioning system in which door sets or  glazing ponds including one or more panes of glass (40) comÂ­ prise a frame (35) around which are secured spaced pairs of  metal clips (42) over which glazing beads (39) fit to define a  channel receiving a peripheral edge portion of the pane.  the  metal clips (42) are secured to the frame (35) by tabs (44)  which are pressed out from the metal forming the clips.  a  sealant may be applied between the glazing beads and the  glass.  this is destroyed by fire but the pane of glass will  remain intact to preserve the fire resistant properties of the  system.

<DESCRIPTION>
"building or partitionin systems" this invention relates to building or partitioning systems or the like and more particularly to door sets and glazing ponds including one or more panes of glass. in existing building or partitioning systems it is generally the glazing panel which offers the lowest resistance to fire. often the glass is mounted by means of p.v.c or other plastics material beads and fittings which deteriorate and burn after only a short exposure to intense heat. even some aluminium fittings have proved unsatisfactory. what we now propose is a building or partitioning system in which door sets or glazing ponds including one or more panes of glass comprise a frame, spaced pairs of resilient metal clips arranged at intervals around the frame, and metal beads which fit over the clips to define a channel cor receiving a peripheral edge portion of a pane of glass. preserably, the clips are secured to the frame by tabs which are pressed from the metal forming the clip. an embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with referex e to the accompanying drawings o! which: figure 1 is a fragmentary view of a section of a partition including a glazing pond; figure 2 is a perspective view generally on arrow a in figure 1; figure 3 is a perspective view of a resilient metal bead clip; and figure 4 is a cross-section showing the manner in which glazing beads are arranged for holding a pane of glass. thie partition has vertical studs 10 (one shown) secured at intervals in a base channel 12 their upper ends 14 being connected to a head channel 16 by stud extending brackets 18 affording limited adjustment of the height of the partition. panels 20 of plasterboard or other suitable material are clamped to the vertical studs 10 by battens 22 in the form of shallow channel sections over which cover strips 24 are fitted to conceal the clamping screws 26. the cover strip 24 is cut away for clarity at the bottom of figure 1. at intervals along the foot of the partition are clips 28 carrying a skirting 29 extruded p.v.c. or other plastics material. when a glazing pond is required a horizontal stud 30 is secured between adjacent vertical studs 10 (one shown) by stud angle brackets 34 and a rectangular frame 35 is built by horizontal and vertical glazing spacers 36 which are secured to this respective studs 30 and 10 but extend beyond the edges thereof so as to bridge the full width of the partition including the thickness o two plasterboard panels 20 and the stud (10 or 30) therebetween. a facing is provided by further cover strips or glazing channels 38. a pane of glass 40 is mounted in the frame 35 by means of metal (e.g. aluminium) glazing beads 39 held by pairs of spaced resilient metal glazing bead clips 42 secured at intervals along the horizontal and vertical glazing channels. for ease of

claims:   1. a building or partitioning system of the kind including door sets or glazing ponds   comprising    one or more panes of glass and a frame for each of the said panes characterised by spaced pairs of resilient metal clips (42) arranged at intervals around each frame (35) and metal glazing beads (39) which fit over the clips to define a channel for receiving a peripheral edge portion of the pane of glass (40).    2. a system according to claim 1 characterised in that each resilient clip (42) is secured to the frame (35) by tabs (44) which are   pressed    from the metal forming the clip (42).   3. a system according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the blazing beads (39) are generally c-shaped in cross-section, and fit over the clips (42) such that the clips extend into the interior of the glazing beads (39).   4. 4 system according to   a:ly    one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that -a sealant is applied between the glazing beads and the pane of glass.   5. a building or partitioning system constructed and arranged substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
