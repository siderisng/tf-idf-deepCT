<ABSTRACT>
an articulated railroad vehicle (1) having two or more  body portions (2,3) is supported on three or more single wheel  set trucks (6,7,8).  each truck is pivotally attached to a vehicle  body portion.  sensing means (4,5) detect the angle between  the articulated body portions.  the output from the angle of  articulated sensing means is used to guide each of the wheel  sets to a radial configuration when the vehicle negotiates a  curve.  in the preferred embodiment the sensing means com­ prises hydraulic actuators (23,24,25) and the wheel set guid­ ing mechanisms comprises further hydraulic actuators  (29,35,40).
