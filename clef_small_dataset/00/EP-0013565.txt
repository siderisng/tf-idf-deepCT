<ABSTRACT>
in this apparatus, which is intended in particular for transport receptacles for intermediates for the production of polyurethane foam, an outer receptacle (1, 11, 21) provided with a releasable closure is provided, into which a transport receptacle (4, 14, 24) to be emptied can be inserted with sealing against the inside of the outer receptacle (1, 11, 21).  leading into the interior of the transport receptacle (4, 14, 24) to be emptied is an outlet line (7), which is passed through the outer receptacle (1, 11, 21), the interspace between the outer receptacle (1, 11, 21) and the transport receptacle (4, 14, 24) being designed as a pressure space which can be brought to the pressure of a fluid medium and to which a pressure-medium feed line (5, 15, 25) is allocated.  using such an apparatus, it is possible to transport liquid intermediates for plastics in a simple and loss-free manner to the processing stage without the necessity for transfer from the transport receptacle into some other receptacle.  <image>
