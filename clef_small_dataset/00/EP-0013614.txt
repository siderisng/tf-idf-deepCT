<ABSTRACT>
a sample tube for obtaining a column of liquid of pre­ determined height in laboratory applications comprises a  simple and effective construction, with a local restriction 16 in  internal diameter a predetermined distance from an inlet end  12 and a movable valve member such as a lead shot 20  disposed in the tube between the restriction 16 and the oppo­ site end 14, for co-operating with the restriction to retain a  column of liquid at the level of the valve member and restric­ tion 16 by surface tension effects.  in operation, liquid is drawn  into the tube by suction to a level substantially above restric­ tion 16, then the suction is removed and the liquid is allowed  to drain out of the end 12, passing the lead shot 20 owing to an  imperfect seal between the lead shot and the restriction 16.   when the liquid reaches the level of the lead shot and restric­ tion, it is retained at this level by surface tension effects  interacting with the lead shot and restriction.
