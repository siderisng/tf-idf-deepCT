<ABSTRACT>
in the manufacture of a monolithic led array, in which  portions of the array are electrically isolated from one another  by channels (5) cut or etched through the slice of n-type  material (1), the channels are filled with a glass frit which is  bonded to the semiconductor material on each side of the  channel, to give a robust construction.  a suspension of glass  particles in a liquid medium is introduced into the channels,  then the liquid is removed and the glass powder is sintered;  the channels may be of uniform width, or may consist of a  wide portion (10), formed first from the back of the slice, and a  narrower, shallow portion (11) formed subsequently from the  front of the slice to meet the wide portion, to give high resolu­ tion.  the glass suspension may be introduced into the chan­ nels by spreading or spinning over the slice surface, or by  electrophoretic deposition and/or capillary action.
