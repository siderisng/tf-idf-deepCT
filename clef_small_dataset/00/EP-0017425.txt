<ABSTRACT>
n-acyl-6-aminopenicillanic acid sulfones, including  methicillin sulfone and the novel compounds quinacillin  suifone and cloxacillin sulfone, whose corresponding n-acyl-­ 6-aminopenicillanic acid has a rate constant not more than  100 seconds⁻¹, are of utility as β-lactamase deactivators and  can be administered to animals being treated with a β-lactam  antibiotic.  compositions comprise the sulfones, optionally in  admixture with a β-lactam antibiotic and/or a pharmaceutical  carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
n-acyl-6-am8inopenicillanic acid derivatives, their use as ss-lactamase deactivators, and compositions containing them and s-lactam antibiotics. this invention relates to n-acyl-6-aminopenicllanic acid derivatives, some of which are novel per se, to their use as ss-lactamase deactivators, and to compositions containing them and ss-lactam antibiotics. the resistance of certain bacteria to ss-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins is frequently due to b-lactamases, bacerial enzymes which catalyse the rapid hydrolysis of the ss-lactam ring of the antibiotics. one approach to the problem of overcoming this resistance has been to use antibiotics which, because of their structure, are poor substrates for the hydrolytic bacterial enzymes. the cephamycins disclosed by nagarajan et al, j.a.c.s. 93 (1971) 2308-2310, are such hydrolysisresistant antibiotics. another approach has been to use a ss-lactamase deactivator which is itself not an effective antibiotic, in conjunction with an antibiotic, to protect the antibiotic from hydrolysis. one such deactivator is clavulanic acid, disclosed by howarth et al, j.s. chem. conunun. (1976) 276-277; reading et al, antimicrob. agents chemother.ll (1977) 952-857 and dumon et al, antimicrob. agents chemother. 15 (1979) 315-317. other compounds which deactivate bacterial hydrolytic enzymes are some carbapenam compounds such as, for example, ps-5 disclosed by okamura et al, j. antibiotics 31 (1978) 480-482and the olivanic acid derivatives disclosed by brown et al, j.c.s. chem. commun. (1977) 953-954 and maeda et al, j. antibiotics 30 (1977) 770-773. clavulanic acid and the carbapenams have all been isolated from natural sources. synthetic compounds have also been used to deactivate e-lactamases. examples are 66-bromo-des-amino- penicillanic acid disclosed by pratt et al, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 75 (1978) 4145-4149 and knott-ilunziker et al, biochem. j. 177 (1979) 365-367; 6-des-aminopenicillanic acid sulfone (cp-45899) of formula i emi2.1 disclosed by english et al, antimicrob. agents chemother. 14 (1978) 414-419 and belgian patent specification no. 867,859; and 6-chloro-des-aminopenicillanic acid sulfone disclosed by cartwright et al, nature 278 (1979) 360-361. methicillin sulfone, of formula ii emi2.2 is disclosed by johnson et al, j. org. chem. 28 (1963) 1927, but no utility is ascribed to this compound therein. according to the present invention, n-acyl derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid sulfone whose corresponding n-acyl derivative of 6-aminopenicillanic acid has a rate constant (cat) of not more than 100, preferably not more than 25, seconds 1, are of utility as ss-lactamase deactivators and can be used for that purpose in animals being treated with a ss-lactam antibiotic. the n-acyl-6-aminopenicillanic acid sulfones can be administered to any animal, including humans, with a bacterial infection, either alone, if the patient is being treated with a ss-lactam antibiotic, or i admixture with a -b-lactam a.,xldiotic. in either case, if desired, a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic carrier substance may be used. the relative proportions of the sulfone and the antibiotic administered to the patient or present in the mixture may be from 1:100 to 100:1 by weight, depending on specific circumstances. the dosage consequently can vary over a wide range depending upon the dosage of the desired ss-lactam antibiotic, which conventionally ranges from 50 mg
