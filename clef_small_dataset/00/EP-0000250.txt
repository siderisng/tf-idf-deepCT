<ABSTRACT>
a drainage foil comprising a hard wearing nose portion  that includes the leading edge of the foil and which is normally  permanently fixed to a web forming machine.  the trailing  part of the foil is detachable and has an upper surface  parallel to, or at least in part downwardly inclined to, the  upper surface of the nose portion.  among the advantages of  the arrangement is the ability to alter the drainage effect of  foils in a web forming machine by removal or substitution of  the detachable portion while the machine is running so that  the web forming cloth is supported during such interchange  or removal and so that the nose portion is not damaged by  the handling involved in removal or substitution of a foil.
