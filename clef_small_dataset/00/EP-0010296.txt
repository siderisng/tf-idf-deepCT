<ABSTRACT>
triglycerides in a sample are quantitatively determined  using a test composition having a system for converting the  triglycerides to fatty acids and glycerol, a system for oxidizing  the glycerol, and a system for determining the amount of  oxygen consumed or the amount of hydrogen peroxide or  glyceraldehyde formed in the oxidation of the glycerol.

<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention the present invention relates to a method for the quantitative determination of triglycerides in a sample by an enzymatic reaction and a test composition suitable there for. the determination of triglycerides is a clinically significant lipid test for hyper-lipoidemia. however, the conventional methods for such determination are burdensome in operation and are, therefore, inconvenient for routine use. for example, the most commonly employed procedure at present is the acetylacetone test in which triglycerides are first isolated by extraction with an organic solvent. the triglycerides are then hydrolyzed with an alkali and the glycerol which is formed is oxidized with an oxidizing agent such as sodium metaperiodate. the formaldehyde thus formed is condensed with acetylacetone and the degree of the color developed is determined by colorimetry. the operation thus comprises several steps. the acetylacetone procedure is disclosed in, for example, m.j. fletcher, "a colorimetric method for estimating serum triglycerides" clinic a chimica acta viol. 22, 393-397 (1968). more recently, a method for the determination of serum triglycerides by an enzymatic reaction is disclosed in u.s. patent no. 4,038,146. in this method, triglycerides are hydrolyzed into fatty acids and glycerol by the action of lipoprotein. l4pase and the gly cerol is converted to dihydroxyacetonk by the action of glycerol dehydrogenase in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad). the nadh thus formed is converted to a pigment and the degree of color development in the visible ray region is measured. although this method is capable of being carried out in one step, it is difficult to adapt to automatic analytical instruments. it has now been found that triglycerides in a sample may be quantitatively determined simply by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, the enzymatic oxidation of glycerol thus produced and thereafter detecting tie / -so formed or alternatively the consumption of oxygen. summary of the invention according to the present invention, triglycerides in a sample are quantitatively determined by solvolysis of the triglycerides to form fatty acids and glycerol, oxidizing the glycerol with glycerol oxidase in the presence of oxygen to form glyceraldehyde and hydrogen peroxide and determining the amount of glyceraldehyde or hydrogen peroxide formed or determining the oxygen uptake. broadly, the mechanism of the present invention is illustrated as follows: emi2.1 <tb> triglycerides <tb> <sep> solvolysis <tb> fatty <sep> acid <sep> + <sep> glycerol <tb> <sep> enzymatic <sep> reaction <sep> (glycerol <tb> <sep> oxidase) <sep> in <sep> the <sep> presence <sep> of <sep> 2 <tb> <sep> glyceraldehyde <sep> + <sep> h <sep> 202 <tb> <sep> l <sep> i <tb> <sep> detection <sep> detection <tb> the reactions described above proceed stoichiometrically and the amount of glyceraldehyde or hydrogen peroxide formed or oxygen uptake is proportional to the amount of triglyceride in the test sample. detailed description of the invention basically, the method and test composition for the determination of the present invention comprises a system for converting triglycerides in a sample to glycerol and fatty acids (system i), a system for oxidizing the glycerol with glycerol oxidase in
