<ABSTRACT>
the substituted tetrazines of the formula:    and of the formula:    wherein: r¹, r² and r⁴ each represent hydrogen, phenyl,  alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or alkenyl or alkynyl of 3 to 6  carbon atoms, each of which may be unsubstituted or  substituted by one or more halogen atoms, hydroxy groups,  cyano groups, carboxy groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups of 2  to 5 carbon atoms, or alkoxy groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms;  or r¹ and r² together represent a single bond; r³ represents  alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 3 to 7 carbon  atoms, phenyl, or phenylalkyl of 7 to 10 carbon atoms, each  of which may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more  halogen atoms, alkyl or alkoxy groups of 1 to 6 carbon  atoms, nitro groups, cyano groups, mercapto groups, or  alkyl-mercapto groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and r⁶  represents a phenyl group substituted in at least the  2-position by fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine; are  effective to combat acarids and their eggs.  most of the compounds are new and processes for their  preparation are described.
