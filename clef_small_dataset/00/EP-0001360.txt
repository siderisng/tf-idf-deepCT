<ABSTRACT>
a lightweight building block and mortarless wall formed  therefrom.  the block (20) is generally rectangular and comprises  side walls (22,24), end walls (26,28), and an interior wall  (30) which divides the interior of the block into two vertical  passages (32,34) through the block.  in certain blocks, parts of  the end and interior walls are removed to form horizontal  channels through the blocks.  the blocks are provided with  projections (36) and recesses having rectangular cross sections  by which means they may be interlocked together to  form walls.  in such a wall, the vertical passages and horizontal  channels may receive reinforcing structures to impart added  strength and load bearing properties to the wall.
