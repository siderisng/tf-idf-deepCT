<ABSTRACT>
a mobile sweeper has a framework (13) supporting a  hopper (21) for receiving dust and debris swept from an  underlying surface.  a broom chamber (32) is mounted on the  framework (13) to overlie the surface to be swept and is in  communication with the hopper (21).  the broom chamber  (32) can move vertically relative to the framework (13).  a  rotary driven broom (53) is mounted on the broom chamber  (32) and is capable of limited vertical movement relative to  the chamber (32).  a resilient tubular seal (84) is disposed  between the broom chamber (32) and the hopper (21) so that  a dust seal is maintained therebetween while the broom  chamber (32) undergoes vertical movement.  a bump  encountered on the underlying surface elevates the broom  chamber (32) permitting the sweeper to pass thereover while  allowing the broom (53) to descend and continue in sweepÂ­ ing contact with the surface.
