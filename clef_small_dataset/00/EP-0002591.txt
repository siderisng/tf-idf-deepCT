<ABSTRACT>
a system for priming liquid ink writing instruments such  as ink jet writers and capillary ink pens is disclosed.  a source  of ink (12) is pressurized to force ink through the ink jet or  other pen (10) so that a small droplet is formed at the jet or  pen outlet.  as the drop forms at the jet or pen (10), it is  eventually drawn away into an adjacent orifice in a collector  ring (30) by capillary action.  an integrated priming pump (26)  serves both to pressurize the ink source (12) to form the ink  droplet, and to apply a vacuum to a collector bottle (32)  which is coupled via a flow control element (38) to the orifice  to remove the ink drawn away into collector ring (30) by  capillary action.  the priming pump (26) includes a pressure  relief valve to ensure that the ink jet or pen is not  overpressurized during priming.  in ink jet writer applications,  the drop removal orifice is formed as a portion of the droplet  charging ring.
