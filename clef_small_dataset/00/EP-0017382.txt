<ABSTRACT>
a multi-element transducer array ultrasonic imaging  system in which a selected group of adjacent elements is  used, the selected group being sequenced along the array to  achieve a scanning action, and signals to and/or from the  elements of the selected group being delayed so as to focus  the selected group to a desired focal length in transmission  and or reception respectively, including a respective trans­ mitter circuit (t) connected with each element (l) of the  array, each transmitter being arranged to be enabled by the  application of an enable signal thereto and arranged to  produce a transmission pulse which is applied to its  connected element upon the application of a control signal to  the transmitter while the transmitter is in the enabled state.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to ultrasonic imaging systems for producing ultrasonic images of objects. in particular the invention relstes to multielement transducer array ultrasonic imaging systems in which a selected group of adjacent elements is used, the selected group being sequences along the array to achieve a scanning action, and signals to and/or from the elements of the selected group being delayed so as to focus the selected group to a desired focal length in transmission and/or reception respectivelyo such a system will hereinafter be referred to as a system of the kind specified in knoam systems of the kind specified in transmission high voltage pulses for application to the elements of the selected active group are produced by a single set of transmitters (usually equal in number to half the number of elements in the active group) the high voltage pulses from the transmitters are applied to the correct elements of the array via respective independently controllable switches, one switch bein connected in the signal path of each element. thus the selection of the switches determines the active group of elements in transmission and the same switches are used to determine the active group in reception. thus since the switching is performed with high voltage signals the switches must be high voltage com- ponents and to ensure good system performance the switches should have a low "on" resistance to reduce losses in reception and should have a low noise contribution so as to provide a good signal/noise ratio in reception. it is an object of the invention to provide a system of the kind specified wherein the above constraints on good system performance are obviate, in accordance with the invention a system of the kind specified includes a respective transmitter connected with each element of the array, each transmitter being arranged to be enabled by the application of an enable signal thereto and arranged to produce a transmission pulse which is applied to its connected element upon the application of a control signal while the transmitter is in the enabled state. preferably there is also associated with each element a receiver switch arranged to be controlled by the output voltage of the respective transmitter so as to be closed by the quiescent output of said transmitter and to be opened by the transmission pulse output of said transmitter preferably each said transmitter comprises an ahz gate to the inputs of which a control signal and an enable signal are applied, a switch arranged to be controlled by the output of the ±nz gate and connected between a first potential and a second different potential, and a capacitance having one terminal connected to the switch so as to be at the first potential when the switch is closed and to be at the second potential when the switch is open, the other terminal of the capacitance forming the transmitter output. said transmitters are preferably so arranged that their quiescent output voltages are controlled by said enable signals. preferabl; each said receiver
