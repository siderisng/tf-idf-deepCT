<ABSTRACT>
a method of making 2,4,5-trichlorophenol by chlorinating  2,5-dichlorophenol is characterised by reacting 2,5-dichlorophenol  with chlorine in the presence of liquid inert  polar aprotic reaction medium such as nitrobenzene or a  chlorinated hydrocarbon reaction medium, particularly 1,2-dichloroethane,  and preferably a lewis acid catalyst, particularly  aluminium chloride.  the product contains a higher ratio  of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol to 2,3,6-trichlorophenol than has  been obtainable previously.
