<ABSTRACT>
1.  an apparatus for applying to inner surface regions of cavities in a motor vehicle body a layer of an anti-corrosion material which is liquifiable both by the addition of heat and by the addition of solvent, characterized by the combination of the following features : a) the apparatus includes lines (15, 16) which serve to feed the material (8) into the cavities (supports 11, 12) and whose free ends are supported (17, 18) so as to be directed upwardly, b) there is provided for the body (1) a holder which is adapted for lowering the body (1) into a position in which downwardly directly holes (13, 14) in the body (1) which lead to the cavities (11, 12) are aligned with the free ends of the lines (15, 16) in a leak-proof manner, and for raising the body (1) from the ends of the lines (15, 16), c) the lines (15, 16) are heated and lead from a heated reservoir (6, 7) for the material (8) in a molten state, the said lines being supplied with the molten material (8) from the said reservoir by means of a feed device (19, 20), d) a heated collecting trough (2) for the molten material (8') flowing off from the cavities (11, 12) after the latter have been filled extends below the holder for the body (1) and the free ends of the lines (15, 16) and is connected by way of an outlet line (22) to devices (23) for preparing the collected material (8'), and a feed device (21) is connected to the reservoir (6, 7).
