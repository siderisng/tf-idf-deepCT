<ABSTRACT>
a method for the removal of a fluid material from a  container (1) and a container (1) for carrying out the  method, wherein the container is provided at its lowest  part with a self-closing valve (3) adapted to be opened by  an upward thrust and wherein a drain tube (5) is provided  below the valve, at least a section of the drain tube (6)  being adapted to move upwardly so as to co-operate with  the valve (3), a striking means (8) being provided on the  drain tube (5) and adapted to provide an upward thrust to  the valve body (3) of the valve as the striking means (8)  moves upwardly.  the method comprises moving the striking  means (8) upwardly so as to open the valve (3), thereby  causing the fluid material to flow out of the container (1)  and into the drain tube (5).
