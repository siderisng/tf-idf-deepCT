<ABSTRACT>
an energy-absorbing torque transmitter comprising a  hub member and rim member, one of which is connected to  an output shaft, the other to an input shaft, the hub member  having at least two hub rollers mounted thereon, the rim  member of larger diameter having a plurality of rim rollers  mounted thereon, said hub and rim members being operaÂ­ tively connected by at least one belt of an oriented  copolyetherester elastomer trained over hub and rim rollers,  said belt capable of being stretched by up to about 60% of its  original length upon application of force to either shaft to  permit relative rotation of said hub member with respect to  said rim member so that torque is transferred from one shaft  to the other through said belt.
