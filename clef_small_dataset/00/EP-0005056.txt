<ABSTRACT>
a fluid coupling device is disclosed of the type including  an output coupling member (13), a cover (35), a valve plate  (29) separating the fluid reservoir chamber (33) from the fluid  operating chamber (31), and an input coupling member (11)  rotatably disposed in the operating chamber.  valving (41)  controls the flow of fluid between the reservoir and the  operating chamber in response to variations in a condition  such as temperature.  the input member has a front face (55)  adjacent the valve plate and a rear face (57) co-operating  with the adjacent surface (59) of the output member to define  interdigitated lands and grooves (61, 63).  the input member  defines a plurality of fluid passages (71) permitting direct  axial communication of fluid between the front face and the  lands and grooves.  this direct flow into and out of the lands  and grooves is effective to reduce substantially the time  required to achieve full engagement and full disengagement  of the coupling.  the invention is also effective to feed fluid  into the lands and grooves during engagement, to increase  the overall torque capacity of the coupling.
