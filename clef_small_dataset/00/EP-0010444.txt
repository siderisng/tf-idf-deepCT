<ABSTRACT>
a preformed roof panel of a furnace comprises an outer  layer (37) of openwork form from which there is suspended a  thermally insulating inner layer (38).  the inner layer consists  of a corrugated web of ceramic fibres which is exposed in the  openings defined by the outer layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
title a furnace this invention relates to a furnace, in particular to the structure of a furnace wall. by a wall, we mean herein any structure which defines a bout wry of a furnace chamber and we use the term generically to include a roof and a door of a furnace. furnace walls commonly comprise an outer layer of imperforate sheet metal and a lining constructed of blocks of thermally insulating material. according to a first aspect of the invention, we provide a furnace having a wall which comprises an inner layer of thermally insulating material and an outer lay which supports the inner layer, thereon the outer layer is of openwork form and the or each inner layer supporte@ thereon is adapted to admit to the interior of the furnace aprobe when the probe is thrust into the wall from the outside of the furnace. by openwork, we mean an array of elements which define apertures between them. preferably, the elements are initially structurally separate members which are secured together in spaced apart relation to form a panel of openwork form alternatively, the elements of a panel may be integral with one another. we have discovered that an outer layer of openwor@ form is better able to withstand heating up and cooling down of a furnace without undergoing deformation, than i an outer layer of imperforate sheet metal. a further advantage of an outer layer of openwork form is that the presr- ce or hot sp@@@ or the .e i:ffi > er l;. or layers, that is places where the temperature of the outer surface of the inner layer is excessively high, can be observed through the apertures in the openwork outer layer and the exact position of such hot spots can be determined. according to a second aspect of the invention, we provide a furnace having a wall which comprises an inner layer of thermally insulating material and an outer layer which supports the inner layer, wherein the outer layer is of openwork form, the inner layer comprises a web of fibrous material in which the fibres are not bonded to each other throughout at least a part of the web and the web is exposed in openings defined by the outer layer. fibres which are not bonded to each other can be moved apart to admit between them a probe which is to be inserted through the wail into the furnace chamber. thus, temperature measuring instruments can be inserted through the wall at almost any selected position to measure the temperature at a required position within the furnace and subsequently the instruments can be moved to other positions. if the inner layer of a furnace in accordance with the second aspect of the invention becomes defective in a local region, a temporary repair can be effected by pushing additional thermally insulating material through the apertures of the outer layer. furthermore, if a hot spot or other defect is observed from the outside of the furnace, the position
