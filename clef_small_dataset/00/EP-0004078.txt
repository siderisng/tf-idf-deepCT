<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a color correction method and a circuit for its implementation, which are particularly suitable for application in graphical image production. The color-corrected image is disassembled in pixels. A maximum color to be corrected and the top of the vector associated with your associated vector in the color space will be selected a spatially limited area. For each of the color-corrected pixels, it is checked whether the vector associated with its tip is in the range, and for the color vectors lying with its tip within the range, a correction according to a color correction vector is made, which is made up of a freely selectable vector and one Overlay variable, which makes the color correction vector maximum when the color vector to be corrected coincides with the vector of the maximum to be corrected, and the closer to zero, the closer of the color vector to be corrected is on the edge of the area. Furthermore, a circuit is indicated, with which the process can be carried out quickly.
