<ABSTRACT>
thermoplastic compositions comprise blends of 15 to 65  parts by weight of thermoplastic crystalline polyolefin resin  and 85 to 35 parts by weight of cross-linked rubbery  chlorosulfonated polyethylene (cross-linked csm rubber)  per 100 total parts by weight of polyolefin resin and csm  rubber, in which the csm rubber is cross-linked to the extent  that no more than 40 weight percent of the rubber is  extractable in toluene at 23°c.  compositions having both  thermoplastic and elastomeric properties contain the  polyolefin resin in an amount up to 50 weight percent of the  composition, and csm rubber, cross-linked to the extent that  no more than 20 weight percent of the rubber is extractable  in toluene at 23°c. , in an amount up to 85 weight percent of  the composition.  compositions of the invention can be  prepared by continuous mastication of a blend of thermoplastic  crystalline polyolefin resin and uncured csm rubber  with curative for the csm rubber at curing temperature until  the required extent of cross-linking of the rubber is attained.
