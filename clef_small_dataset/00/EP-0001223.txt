<ABSTRACT>
a water-insoluble immunological reagent having a specific gravity of about that of water comprising discrete particles of a latex carrier to which a water-soluble polyhydroxy compound is covalently bound having condensed thereto through a covalent link a known immunologically active material (including enzymes, proteins, hormones, antigens, antibodies, polysaccharides, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, viruses and rickettsia); a process for the manufacture of said reagent; an immunological method using said reagent; a kit containing said reagent and the use of said reagent in immunological determinations.  a latex comprises discrete particles of a latex carrier to which a polyhydroxy compound is covalently bonded.
