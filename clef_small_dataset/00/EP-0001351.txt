<ABSTRACT>
in a sodium sulphur cell, the cathodic reactant comprising  sulphur and sodium polysulphides is highly corrosive and  of poor electrical conductivity.  it is known to put carbon material,  e. g.  a graphite felt in this reactant to form a conductive  path to a metal current collector which must be protected  against corrosion in any cell having a long life.  the present  invention is directed to an improved current collector.  figure 4 illustrates an embodiment in which the current  collector comprises an aluminium rod or tube 25 surrounded  or partially surrounded by a sheath 26 of a metal, such as a  nickel alloy, resistant to corrosive attack.  the aluminium rod  or tube 25, where it is exposed, becomes coated with an oxide  and/or sulphide layer which is non conductive.  the sheath is  welded at 28 through this layer to provide electrical conductivity  and may have radially extending fins 27.
