<ABSTRACT>
in lining parts to be stamped of an aluminium electro­ lytic cell by filling a carbonaceous stamping material into  the part and stamping the filled stamping material, a mix­ ture consisting essentially of a carbon aggregate and a  binder and being capable of being stamped at a tempera­ ture above 100° c is prepared; a solvent for the binder  containing aromatic hydrocarbon as a main component in  an amount incapable of effecting stamping of the stamping  material at room temperature.  but capable of stamping at a  temperature of 50 to 100° c, when added to the mixture, is  prepared separately from the mixture: the mixture and the  solvent are mixed together to prepare a carbonaceous  stamping material; and the carbonaceous stamping ma­ terial is applied to the part to be stamped of the cell at a  temperature of 50 to 100° c to effect the lining of the cell.   the stamping environment is greatly improved by eliminat­ ing generation of pitch fumes and hot vapors and at the  same time deterioration in physical properties of the stamp­ ing material is substantially prevented.
