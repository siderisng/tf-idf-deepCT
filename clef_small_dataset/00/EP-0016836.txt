<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a method and apparatus for scattering  a foamable mixture capable of forming poly-urethane foam.   foamable mixture is uniformly and transversely scattered on a  moving surface to thereby provide a uniform layer of the foam­ able mixture over the whole area of the moving surface.  the  foamable mixture is first fed to and spred over first surfaces  and then scattered from the first surfaces to a second moving  surface as fine particulates of foamable mixture.  in practice,  the foamable mixture (10) is fed to and spread over two  spreader-rolls (1) and (2), i. e. , the first surfaces, and then finely  divided into particulates by two scatter-rolls (3) and (4) that  each rotate in engagement with the associated spreader-rolls.   the particulates of foamable mixture are then scattered on the  moving surface.  this process is useful for manufacturing lami­ nate products having a sheet or layer of polyurethane foam.
