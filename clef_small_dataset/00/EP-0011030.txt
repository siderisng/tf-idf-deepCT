<ABSTRACT>
the substance to be determined is subjected to a specific bonding reaction with a primary bonding partner in a known and limited quantity, a part of the said primary bonding partner remaining after completion of the specific bonding reaction.  the remaining bonding partner is adsorbed specifically on a solid phase consisting of a polyacrylamide gel sensitised with a substance which has specific bonding properties for the primary bonding partner and is then detected enzymatically or by fluorescence.
