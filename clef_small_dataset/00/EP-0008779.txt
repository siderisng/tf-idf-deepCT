<ABSTRACT>
1.  an air outlet device for ventilating rooms comprising a distributor box (10) connectable to an air supply duct, an air outlet frame (16) leading from the distributor box (10) to the room, outlet openings dividing the air outlet frame (16) in the longitudinal direction, air directing plates (22) which extend in the longitudinal direction of the air outlet frame (16) and which are adjustable in sections, and a slide (24) which is disposed on the distributor box side of the air outlet frame (16), extends over the entire length of the air outlet frame (16), is displaceable in the longitudinal direction and comprises covering surface (30) whose size corresponds to the outlet cross-section of the outlet openings and whose spacing corresponds to the spacing of the outlet openings, characterized in that, - the air outlet frame (16) is divided by crossbars (18) into compartments (20) which form the outlet openings ; - the air directing plates (22) are disposed in the compartments (20) so as to be individually adjustable ; - second and third slides (26 and 28) are mouned so as to be displaceable in the longitudinal direction, and are connected to and displaceable in the longitudinal direction, and are connected to and displaceable towards the first slide (24) and comprise covering surfaces (32, 34), whose size corresponds to the outlet cross-section of the compartments (20), and - the spacing of the covering surfaces (30, 32, 34) of the three slides (24, 26, 28) corresponds in each case to the quadruple spacing of the compartments (20).
