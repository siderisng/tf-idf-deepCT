<ABSTRACT>
r-n-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)- 3-phenyl-propylamines  of formula (i):    wherein:   r₁ is hydrogen or fluorine;   r₂ is hydrogen or hydroxy; provided that at least one  of r₁ or r₂ is hydrogen;   r₃ is hydroxy;   c is an asymmetric carbon atom having the r abso­ lute stereochemical configuration; and pharmaceutically-­ acceptable salts thereof, can be used in the treatment of con­ ditions of depressed cardiac contractility or to physically con­ dition biological systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
r-n- (2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl) - 3-phenylpropyl gamines, their formulations, use and preparation this invention relates to novel propylamine derivatives useful in the treatment of various cardiac and circulatory disorders, pharmaceutical formulations containing those derivatives and methods of preparing the novel propylamines. whilst numerous compounds which have inotropic properties are known, use of such compounds is severely limited due to their associated undesirable side-effects or rapid inactivation in biological systems. in many cases the treatment of congestive heart failure can only be effectively accomplished with the use of older drugs such as digitalis and allied cardiac glycosides. the main pharmacodynamic activity of digitalis resides in its ability to increase the force of myocardial contraction. digitalis is thus widely used in the treatment of cardiac failure, and is said to be presently the fourth most frequently prescribed drug in the united states of america. whilst digitalis and its related glycosides are widely used, they remain some of the most dangerous drugs employed. all digitalis-type preparaticns are toxic at high doses. digitalis toxicity in the heart can be lethal, most of digitalis poisoning being due te the cumulative effect of maintenance doses taken over a relatively long period of time, or from use cf a large dose in the treatment of severe arrhythmias. certain catecholamines recently have been found to exert a positive inotrople effect on heart muscle without the detrimental side effect of si- nificant increase in heart rate. u.s. patent no. 3,987,200 discloses a method of increasing cardiac contractility utilizing compounds such as dl 3, 4-dihydroxy-n- [3- (4-hydroxyphenyl) -1-methyl-n- propyll-ss-phenethylamine hydrochloride, now generically referred to as dobutamine. dobutamine is well suited for treating myocardial infarction with failure, congestive heart failure, cardiac by-pass surgery and traumatic surgery. however, like most other catechol derivatives, it is rapidly inactivated in biological systems by the action of catechol o-methyl transferase. dobutamine and its related drugs are thus restricted to intravenous infusion in hospitalized patients and do not lend themselves to maintenance therapy and the prophylactic treatment of heart failure. the present invention provides a select group of phenethanolamine-type compounds which are uniquely inotropic, cause minimal undesired side effects, are not rapidly inactivated in biological systems, and are orally effective. the compounds are thus ideally suited for the treatment and maintenance of conditions of depressed cardiac contractility, and can be used prophylactically in patients suffering from heart failure. according to the present invention there are provided compounds of formula (i): emi3.1 wherein: r1 is hydrogen or fluorine; ri is hydrogen or hydroxy; provided that 2 provided at least one of r1 or r2 is hydrogen; r3 is hydroxy; c is an asymmetric carbon atom having the * r absolute stereochemical configuration; and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. preferred compounds of this invention are those of the above formula wherein r1 is hydrogen and r2 is hydroxy. this invention additionally provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the above formula associated with a pharmaceuticallyacceptable carrier therefor. the compounds of formula (i), or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, can be used in the treatment
