<ABSTRACT>
copolymers are described of at least 75% by weight of  tert-butyl styrene, from 1% to 24% by weight of a  copolymerisable second monomer and from 1% to 10% by  weight of methacrylic acid, the copolymers having certain  specified solubility and rheological characteristics in avtur  50 aviation kerosene.  a process for making the copolymers by  aqueous emulsion polymerisation of the monomers under  certain defined conditions is also described.  the copolymers  are useful as additives to liquid hydrocarbon aircraft fuels for  the purpose of reducing the tendency of such fuels to form  inflammable mists under shock conditions.
