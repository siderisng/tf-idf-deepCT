<ABSTRACT>
a control system for operating a double-acting hydraulic  ram or motor including a proportional meter-out type direc­ tional control valve which meters the flow of fluid out of the  load and, in association therewith, a combined flow and pres­ sure control valve in the return line from the load.  the flow  and pressure control valve is responsive to the pressure drop  across the meter-out orifice of the directional control valve  such that return line flow is restricted at high pressure drops  and the supply pressure to the load is increased at low pres­ sure drops whereby a substantially constant pressure drop  across the meter-out orifice is maintained irrespective of the  size or direction of the load.
