<ABSTRACT>
a character recognition system scans characters to be  recognised in accordance with a predetermined scanning  function and provides representations of curve elements  forming the character.  these representations are com­ pared with representations of a plurality of selected curve  segments and data indicating the "best match" between  each of the curve elements and the curve segment is ob­ tained.  the system is previously trained using a large number  of known characters.  each of these known characters is  scanned and data representing the "best match" between  each of the curve elements of the known character and the  selected curve segment is obtained.  the two sets of data are compared so as to determine  which of the known characters is most closely equivalent to  the character to be recognised.
