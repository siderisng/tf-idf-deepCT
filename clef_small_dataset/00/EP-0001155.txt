<ABSTRACT>
a pipeline inspection system, in which a vehicle moveable  within the pipeline by a fluid flowing in the pipeline, has  sensors associated with the vehicle to detect flaws in the  pipeline, and a speed control for the vehicle in which the  speed control includes a braking system which imposes a  continuous axial drag on the pipeline wall and means are  provided to vary the imposed dray between upper and lower  limits such that the summation of the variable drag characteristics  of the pipeline and the imposed drag remains approximately  constant and the vehicle moves at a speed substantially  equal to the average flow velocity of the fluid in the  pipeline.
