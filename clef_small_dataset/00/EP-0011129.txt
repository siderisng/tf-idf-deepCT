<ABSTRACT>
novel 1,2,4-triazole derivatives are described having the  following formula    wherein r represents hydrogen or methyl, r₁ stands for hyd­ rogen or (c₁-c₄)alkyl, or r and r₁ taken together may rep­ resent a further bond between the carbon atom and the  oxygen atom, r₂ and r₄ each independently, represent hyd­ rogen, chloro, fluoro, bromo, (c₁-c₄)alkyl or (c₁-c₄)alkoxy,  r₃ stands for (c₁-c₄)alkyl, (c₁-c₄)alkoxy, allyloxy propar­ gyloxy, trifluoromethyl, phenyl, chloro, fluoro, bromo or  dimethylamino or r₃ and r₄ taken together may represent a  methylenedioxy group.  also described is a process for their manufacture.  use of  the novel compounds as antireproductive agents and phar­ maceutical compositions containing them as active ingre­ dient are also claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
new 1,2,4 triazole derivatives, a process for their 1anufacturi, their use as antifertility agents and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. the present invention relates to a new class of 1,2,4 -triazoles with antifertility activity, to the process for their preparation, to their use as antireproductive agents and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. the new 1,2,4-triazoles of the present invention have the following general formula emi1.1 wherein r represents hydrogen or methyl, r1 means hydrogen or (c1-c 4)alkyl or r and r1 taken together may represent a further bond between the carbon and the oxygen atom, r2 represent hydrogen, chloro, fluoro, bromo, (cl-c4)alkyl or (c1-c4)alkoxy, r3 stands for (c1-c4)alkyl, (cl-c4)alkoxy, allyloxy, propargyloxy, trifluoromethyl, phenyl, chloro, fluoro, bromo and dimethylamino and r4 represents hydrogen, chloro, fluoro, bromo, (cl-c)alkyl, or (c1-c4)alkoxy or r3 and r4 taken together may represent a methylenedioxy group. as used herein the term "(c1-c4)alkyl" identifies a straight or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, l-me- thylethyl, butyl, l-methylpropyl, 2-methylpropyl and l,l-dimethylethyl, and the expression "(c1-c4)alkoxy11 identifies straight or branched alkoxy radicals having at most 4 carbon atoms selected from methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, l-methylethoxy, butoxy, l-methylpropoxy, 2-me thylpropoxy and l,l-dimethylethoxy. other 5-(2-hydroxymethyl}phenyl-lh-1r2,4-triazoles and more particularly those bearing an unsubstituted or a nitro substituted phenyl group at the 3-position are described in belgian patent no 786.562. said patent covers a new class of l-alkyl-3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4 -triazoles having cns depressant activity which can be prepared also by n-alkylating the corresponding l-unsubstituted derivatives. it will result to any person skilled in the art that, owing to the great mobility of the hydrogen atom of 1,2,4-triazoles (see k. t. potts, chem. rev,, 61, 99, 1961 and, again, k. t. potts, j. chem. soc. 3451, 1954) the compounds of the invention may also exist as the corresponding tautomeric forms emi2.1 wherein the hydrogen atom is located on one of the other two nitrogen atoms of the the triazole triazole nucleus. since it is known that tautomeric forms rapidly exchange into each other, being in a state of dynamic equilbrium it is intended that said tautomeric forms have to be considered as a part of the invention even though, throughout the specification the 3,5-disubstituted-li -1,2,4-triazole derivatives of the present invention have been numbered according to formula i. the compounds of the present invention possess remarka- le antifertility and anti-reproductive properties. a second object of the present. invention is a general method for preparing the novel 1,2,4-triazoles which comprises,as the first step, the preparation of the 2-hydroxymethyl derivatives, i.e. compounds of formula i wherein r and r1 represent hydrogen, which can be synthesized by rearrangement of hydra zones of substituted benzaldehydes with 4-hydrazino -lh-2,3-benzoxazines of tiie formula emi3.1 in the actual practice the rearrangement is carried out, according to j. heterocycl. chem. 9, 58 (1972), simply b refluxing the starting hydrazones in a thigh boiling inert organic solvent such as xylene xylene , halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, ,n-dimethyl formamide and the li- ke, for about 30 to 120 minutes and then
