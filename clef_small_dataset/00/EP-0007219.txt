<ABSTRACT>
a process for catalytically reforming a naphtha with hyd­ rogen in a plurality of serially-connected catalytic reforming  reactors wherein undesirable catalyst activity causing exces­ ive hydrogenolysis and reduced c₅+ hydrocarbon yields  after a fresh catalyst has been regenerated and reactivated  several (e. g.  about 5 or more) times is at least partly reduced  by the addition of a maximum of 0. 01 wt. % sulfur, based on  the total weight of the catalyst to the catalyst of a reactor.  if  desired, water may be injected to displace excess sulfur from  over-sulfided catalyst.  preferably, the amount of sulfur added  to a fresh catalyst is progressively, (and preferably propor­ tionately) reduced from one regeneration-reactivation sequ­ ence to the next such that, on and after about the fifth regen­ eration and reactivation of the catalyst, a maximum of about  0. 01 weight percent sulfur is added to the catalyst.  the catal­ yst of the lead reactor(s) of the series is preferably not directly  sulfided, but indirectly sulfided by sulfur added to, and  released by the tail reactor, or reactors.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification tda process eor catalytically cforr.sint a naphtha in te!e presence of hydrogen" the present invention relates to a process for catalytically reforming a naphtha in the presence of hydrogen. reforming with hydrogen, or hydrofonsing, is well established industrial process employed by the petro leurn industry for upgrading virgin or cracked naphthas for the production of high octane products. noble metal, notably platinum type catalyst are currently czrployed. it has become the practice to employ a plurality of adiabatic fixed-bed reactors in series with provision for interstage heating of the feed to each of the several reactors. in all professes the catalyst must be periodically regenerated by burning off the coke in the initial part of the catalyst reactivation sequence, since coke deposition gradually deactivates the catalyst. in a cyclic type of process, the reactors are individually isolated, or in effect swung out o line by various piping arrangements, the catalyst is regenerated to remove the coke deposits, and then reactivated while the other reactors of the series remain on stream. a "swing reactor" temporarily replaces a reactor which is removed front the series for regeneration and reactivation of the catalyst, and is then put back in series. in such processes hydrogen is produced in net yield, the product being separated into a c5+ liquid product, e.g., a c5/430 f product, and a hydrogen-rich gas a portion of which is recycled to the several reactors of the process unit. in a cyclic reforming unit, individual reactors of the w'jlti-reactor unit can be isolated, the catalyst regenerated and reactivated, and the reactor placed back on stream without sig'iificantly affecting unit feed rate or octane quality. by adjusting the regeneration frequency, the unit can be economically designed for the minimum loading of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation metal, or metals components on the catalyst while maintaining an optimum yield of c reformate at given conditions. essentially all petroleum naphtha feeds contain sulfur, a well known catalyst poison which can gradually accumulate upon and poison the catalyst. most of the sulfur, because of this adverse effect, is generally removed from feed naphthas, e.g., by hydrofining or by contact with nickel or cobalt oxide guard chambers, or both. in use of the more recently developed mulfizmtallic platinum catalysts wherein an additional metal, or metals hydrogenation dehydrogenation component is added as a promoter to the platinum, it has become essential to reduce the feed sulfur to only 8 few parts, per million parts by weight of feed (ppm). for example, in the use of platinum-rhenium catalysts it is generally necessary to reduce the sulfur concentration of the feed well below about 10 ppm, and preferably well below about 2ppm, to avoid excessive loss of catalyst activity and c5 liquid yield. the role of sulfur on the catalyst presents somewhat of an anomaly because the presence of sulfur in the feed can adversely affect the activity of the catalyst and reduce liquid yeild: and yet, sulfiding of the mult4-metallic catalyst species, which is a part of the catalyst reactivation procedure,
