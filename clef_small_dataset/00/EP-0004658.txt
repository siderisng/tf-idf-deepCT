<ABSTRACT>
acetylenic hydrocarbons are removed from a c₄- or  c₅-hydrocarbon mixture containing a c₄- or c₅-diolefin  respectively.  the feedstock (e. g.  a c₄- or c₅- cut from an  ethylene plant) is extractively distilled to remove paraffins  and mono-olefins in the raffinate, using acetonitrile (acn),  dimethyl formamide (dmf), furfural, acetone, dimethylacetamide  or n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone mixed with 0-12 weight  percent water as the extraction solvent.  the bottoms from  this first extractive distillation is subjected to a second  extractive distillation in which virtually acetylenes-free solvent  is used.  isoprene is withdrawn as the distillate with  substantially reduced acetylenes content.  the bottoms of the  second extractive distillation is split three ways.  two streams  are handled conventionally (recycle and heavies removal).   the third is stripped free of acetylenes so that it may be used  as solvent in the second extractive distillation.
