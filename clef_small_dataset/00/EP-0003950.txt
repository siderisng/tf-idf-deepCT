<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a lift device particularly suitable  for lifting handicapped persons with or without wheelchairs,  into a vehicle or building.  the lift can be incorporated into the  doorway of any given vehicle, or into any step structure within  a building.  the lift, in its stowed position, forms the normal  steps and includes a platform made of four hinged parallel  sections (1, 2, 3, 4) which can be withdrawn and folded into  two steps.  the second section (2) which forms the upper step  raiser in the stowed position comprises two telescopically  interconnected elements (41, 43), and can be expanded to  provide a wider platform.  the fourth section (4) which forms  the lower step raiser in the stowed position can be rotated to  act as an access ramp along the forward edge of the platform  and flipped upward to form an angle stop preventing the  wheelchair from rolling backward during platform motion.
