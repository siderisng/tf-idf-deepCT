<ABSTRACT>
1.  system for the articulation of two consecutive links (2) of a chain, particularly for the links carrying workpieces of a chain of a device conveying workpieces between different work stations, comprising two main stirrup pieces (4, 5), at least substantially in u-form, their backs (6, 7) opposite each other and being able to rotate with respect to each other about a first axis of rotation transverse with respect to said backs, said main stirrup pieces (4, 5) being to this end connected by a lug (8) provided with a head (9) at one of its ends and passing through an opening (10) in the back of the first (5) of said main stirrups, so that said head rests on the edge of said opening, characterised in that, at its end opposite the head (9), the lug (8) comprises transverse, parallel and opposite grooves (13, 14) to allow the introduction of the corresponding narrowed part (15) of the said lug in a slot (16) provided in the second main stirrup piece (4), which slot opens in a free edge of the back of the latter and in that elastic means (18') are provided, tending to separate the two main stirrup pieces (4, 5) from each other.
