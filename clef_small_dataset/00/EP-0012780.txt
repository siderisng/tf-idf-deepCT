<ABSTRACT>
a front implement hitch for securing an implement (14)  forwardly of a propelling tractor (12).  the hitch includes a  generally u-shaped frame (30, 32, 48, 34) on which a pair of  forwardly extending implement-supporting lower links (58)  are mounted at their rear ends by mounting means (92)  which include adjustment means (90, 94, 96, 102) for adjust­ ing the lateral spacing between the rear ends of the links.  an  intermediate portion of each of the lower links may contact a  rub block (82) on the frame to limit side to side sway of the  lower links.  the frame is also provided with quick-attach  formations in the form of bayonet pins (38, 40) which engage  apertures in mounting portions (42, 44) carried on the tractor  so that the hitch can be readily attached to and detached  from the tractor.
