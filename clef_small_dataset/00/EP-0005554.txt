<ABSTRACT>
a pair of anatomically fitted trousers with an improved  construction of the crotch and front region consisting of the  usual leg portions, the usual waistband and a novel combination  crotch/front panel (24).  the conventional leg portions with one, two or various  seams at any desired location are closely fitted around each  upper thigh and buttock, are suspended from the waistline  by means of the usual waistband and are joined together at  the rear by a medical seam (32), closely following the  contour line of the sagittal section of the pelvis down to a  point near the anus (30).  starting at said point (30) an oblong  triangular cutout (33) is provided between said leg portions  having two concavely curved long edges (25b, 26b) and one  convexly curved or straight short edge (27b), exposing the  perineum and genitals, the public area and abdominal area  above up to the waistband.  into said triangular cutout the  combination crotch/front panel (24) is inserted, acting like a  large shallowly cupped hand held over the genitals and  acting like an accordion between the leg portions in the  perineal area during leg movement, having two oblong  convexly curved (25a, 26a) or straight edges (25c, 26c) and  a short concavely curved (27a) or straight edge (27c), being  connected along its oblong edges to the leg portions along  the long edges of said triangular cutout and along its short  edge to the waistband, thus connecting the two leg portions  from said point near the anus up to the front portion of the  waistband.
