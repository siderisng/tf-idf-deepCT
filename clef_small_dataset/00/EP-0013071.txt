<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides new histamine h₂- antagonist  compounds of structure 1    in which r¹ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy,  halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, amino, lower alkylamino,  lower alkanoylamino, di(lower alkyl)amino or cyano; r² is in  the 3-, 4- or 5- position and is hydrogen, or r² is lower alkyl  substituted by amino, lower alkylamino, di(lower alkyl)amino,  n-piperidino or n-pyrollidino, or r² is ethoxy or propoxy  ω-substituted by amino, lower alkylamino, di(lower  alkyl)amino, n-piperidino or n-pyrollidino; y is methylene or  oxygen and x is methylene or sulphur provided that one or  two of the groups x and y is methylene; z is hydrogen or  lower alkyl; a is c₁-c₅ alkylene or -(ch₂)pw-(ch₂)q- where w is  oxygen or sulphur and p and q are such that their sum is from  1 to 4, and b is hydrogen, methyl, c₃-c₆ cycloalkyl, a heteroaryl  group optionally substituted by one or more of the groups  lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halo, hydroxy and amino, or b is a  naphthyl, 6-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxinyl), a 4- or 5-  (1,3-benzodioxolyl) group, or a phenyl group optionally sub­ stituted with one or more lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen,  aryl(lower alkoxy), hydroxy, lower alkoxy-lower alkoxy, trif­ luoromethyl, di(lower alkyl)amino, phenoxy, halophenoxy,  lower alkoxyphenoxy, phenyl, halophenyl or lower alkox­ yphenyl groups and pharmaceutical compositions containing  them.  a compound of structure 1 can be prepared by reacting  a compound of structure 3 in which q is nitroamino, loweral­ kylthio, benzylthio or halogen with an amine of structure 2, in  which    r³ is in the 3-, 4- or 5p position and is hydrogen, lower alkyl  substituted by a group r⁴, or is r⁴ch₂ch₂o-or  r⁴ch₂ch₂ch₂o-, where r⁴ is di(lower alkyl)amino,  n-piperidino, n-pyrrollidino, a protected amino group or a  protected lower alkylamino group, and where necessary any  amino-protected group present in the substituent r³ is  removed.
