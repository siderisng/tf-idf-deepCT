<ABSTRACT>
an ammonia production process comprises steam  hydrocarbon primary reforming, air secondary reforming,  carbon monoxide shift, carbon oxides removal, ammonia  synthesis and discarding of non-reactive gases and is made  more economical in energy consumption by using excess  air in secondary reforming and treating the synthesis gas  to separate a hydrogen-enriched stream and returning that  stream to the synthesis.  preferably the synthesis gas after  carbon oxides removal is compressed if at all by no more  than 50% and consequently the process can be carried out  in a plant having a gas circulator but no compressor.  preferably  synthesis is at a pressure in the range 40-80 bar  abs.  and at an outlet temperature in the range 350-430Â° c  over a catalyst containing iron, cobalt and promoting compounds.   recovery of the hydrogen-enriched stream is preferably  from a side stream of synthesis gas.
