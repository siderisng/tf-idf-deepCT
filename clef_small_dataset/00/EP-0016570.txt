<ABSTRACT>
a tire building machine of the expandable bead lock type  employs an elastomeric specially shaped radially expanding  bead lock (43) including a shaping and turning bladder (48)  which includes an air passage system therethrough.  the elas­ tomeric bead lock is confined for radial expansion in an annu­ lar outwardly opening chamber (114) in the form of an isos­ celes trapezoid in radial section with the elastomeric bead lock  being of similar configuration and expanded by direct applica­ tion of air pressure within the chamber.  the configuration of  the annular chamber and the bead lock compensate for  stretching of the bead lock upon enlargement.  the edges of  the bead lock at the axial sides of the chamber are undercut for  flexibility while the walls (70, 71) of the chamber are specially  coated to maintain the seal.  the bead lock incorporates inter­ connected metallic segment side plates (76, 77) which not  only limit the stroke of the moving seal but insure stability  axially of the bead and provide the desired concentricity.  the  bladder is pressurized through an annular air passage system  and sealed conduit (137) extending radially through the pres­ sure chamber inside the bead lock.
