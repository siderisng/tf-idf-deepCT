<ABSTRACT>
isomeric mixtures of dlsubstituted aromatic compounds  are brought into contact with a shape selective crystalline ze­ olite catalyst, under conversion conditions, to undergo selec­ tive reaction of the 1,4-isomer, thereby leaving the 1-2-iso­ mer and/or 1,3-isomer in excess of equilibrium.  the shape  selective zeolite catalyst employed herein comprises a crys­ talline zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and  a constraint index, as herein defined, within the approximate  range of 1 to 12.

<DESCRIPTION>
selective reaction of 1,4-disubstituted - bemzene colsounds - this invention relates to a process for selectively reacting and removing 1-4 disubstituted benzene compounds from mixtures containing such compounds by reacting in the presence of a specified shape selective crystalline zeolite catalyst. the separation of meta or ortho isomers from para disubstituted aromatic compounds is a difficult but necessary step in the production and isolation of ortho and meta compounds. the approach has most frequently been to take advantage of the differences in the boiling points of the various isomers and utilize fractional distillation to make the separation. however, as can be seen from table ia, the differences between the temperatures at which the isomers boil are in reality so very small that in order to achieve efficient separation one must employ very elaborate and expensive distillation columns. table ia boiling points at 760 mm hg emi2.1 emi2.2 <sep> isomer <tb> r1 <sep> r2 <sep> ortho <sep> meta <sep> para <tb> ch3- <sep> ch3- <sep> 144.4 c <sep> 139.1 c <sep> 138.3 c <tb> ch3- <sep> ch3ch2- <sep> 165.2 c <sep> 161.3 c <sep> 162.4 c <tb> ch3- <sep> ch3# <sep> 178.3 c <sep> 175.1 c <sep> 177.1 c <tb> <sep> ch <sep> ch3# <tb> ch3ch2- <sep> ch3hc2- <sep> 138.5 c <sep> 181.0 c <sep> 183.8 c <tb> ch3# <sep> ch3# <sep> 210.0 c <sep> 203.2 c <sep> 210.3 c <tb> <sep> ch- <sep> ch ch3# <sep> ch3# <tb> the time-honored method of isolating or removing particular positional isomers from isomeric mixtures of disubstituted aromatic compounds has also been the classical fractional distillation technique. this method, however, has not been very practical on an industrial scale unless there is a significant difference in the boiling points of the various isomers. in terms of many important industrial aromatic compounds, particularly those having one or more polar substituents, separation or significant enrichment of particular isomers by boiling point is an extremely difficult and expensive endeavor, and at times is quite impossible. table ib below will illustrate the problem with the boiling points of a few typical compounds. table ib b.p., c name ortho meta para hydroxy isopropyl benzene (isopropylphenol) (cumenol) 213.4a 228a 228-30b amino isopropyl benzene 220-1b 225a (isopropylaniline) chloro isopropyl benzene 191c 657mm 198.3a (chlorocumene) 62-688mm methyl benzaldehyde (tolualdehyde) 220a 199a 204-5a chlorobenzaldehyde 211.9a 213-4a 213-4a a. 760 mm hg b. 745 mm hg c. 754.6 mm hg u.s. patent no.3,029,300 to scftaeffer discloses a selective clathration process for the separation of xylene isomers, but this also involves an elaborate procedure requiring very specialized and expensive equipment. a catalytic process for the selective production of particular xylene isomers, involving a platinum on alumina catalyst, is disclosed in u. s. patent no.3,078,318 to berger. selective production of para dialkylbenzenes in the presence of specific zeolite catalysts is described in u.s. patents mo.3,965,209 to butter et al; 4,001,346 to chu; 4,086,287 to kaeding et al and 4,090,981 to-rodewald. it has now been discovered that both polar and non-polar 1,2-disubstituted and 1 ,3-disubstituted aromatic compounds
