<ABSTRACT>
a method of heating a glass sheet which is moved on a  conveyor which contacts one face of the sheet.  in order to  reduce the contact between the contacted surface of each  glass sheet (13) and to keep the leading edge of each sheet  (13) clear of the conveyor (6), anticlastic bending of the sheet  (13) is caused, and the stable anticlastic shape of the sheet  (13) is determined such that the sheet (13) is arched away  from the conveyor (6) transversely of the sheet (13) with  respect to the conveying direction and with the sheet (13)  having a reverse curvature along its longitudinal extent so  that the leading and trailing edges of the sheet are bent away  from the conveyor (6).  anticlastic bending of the sheet (13) is  caused by producing a temperature differential between the  central area and at least a part of the periphery of the sheet  (13), for example, by heating said part of the periphery.
