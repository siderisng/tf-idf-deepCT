<ABSTRACT>
a raster display apparatus capable of displaying graphic  pictures includes a processor 13 for loading character codes  (pointers) in a character buffer 12.  the pointers address a  character/cell generator 22 to derive the bit patterns necesÂ­ sary to refresh the display 1 under control of refresh logic 19.   as the picture becomes increasingly complex, requiring  more and more different character cells, the character/cell  generator 22 fills.  space is created by combining two or  more adjacent cells into a single low-resolution-displayed  cell: an op code associated with each character code  (pointer) determines whether the cell is to be displayed at full  or reduced resolution and causes refresh logic to clock bit  patterns associated with low resolution cells at a slower rate.   optionally, the processor 13 changes low resolution parts of  the picture to high resolution when an operator interacts  with the low resolution part using a light pen 30.
