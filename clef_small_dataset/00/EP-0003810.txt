<ABSTRACT>
1.  a fixing arrangement for a structural element (1) for forming or lining walls, comprising an inherently stable plate (1a) and a backing (1b) made of light insulating material, characterized in that the inherently stable plate (1a) is suspended from a ceiling (2) or wall (3), only in the region of its upper edge by means of its suspension elements which are arranged on its rear side facing towards the backing (1b) and which are insulated with respect to the suspension surface, and is suspended off-centre with respect to its vertical plane of gravity such that the plate (1a) exerts pressure on the backing (1b).
