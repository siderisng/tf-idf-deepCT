<ABSTRACT>
a girder fitting adapted to be secured to a length of  scaffold tube and to clamp the scaffold tube to a girder.  the  fitting (10) comprises a main body (14), a clamp (16) pivotally  mounted on the main body (14) at one end thereof, and means  (18,20) for releasably holding the clamp (16) to the main body  (14).  the clamp (16) and main body (14) are so shaped as to  receive and clamp between them a length of scaffold tube (9)  and the main body (14) is further shaped such that the vertical  load of the scaffold tube (9) is borne substantially entirely by  the main body.  a portion (22) of the main body (14) extends at  an end remote from the clamp (16) in a direction substantially  at right angles to the major length of the main body (14) and a  screw (24) is provided which is engageable with a flange (13)  of the girder whereby a length of scaffold tube (9) fitted with  the fitting (10) can be clamped to the flanged girder.
