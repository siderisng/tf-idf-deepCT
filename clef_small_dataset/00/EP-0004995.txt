<ABSTRACT>
a linear and rotary electromagnetic device particularly  adapted as a linear and rotary stepper or stepper motor.  a  cylindrical movable member or armature (30) is provided  which is mounted for both axial movement and for angular  movement about its axis.  the armature member has teeth  (40) on its surface formed in both axial rows and in  circumferential alignment or rows.  stator means having  poles (60) with windings (62) associated with the poles is  provided, the stator means having a central opening in which  the movable armature member is mounted for axial and  angular movement.  by energizing certain angularly spaced  windings, the movable armature member may be caused to  rotate.  by energizing axially spaced windings, the movable  member of armature can be caused to move axially.   simultaneous angular and axial movement is achieved by  energizing appropriate windings.

<DESCRIPTION>
linear and rotary device this invention relates to electromagnetically actuated devices, more particularly actuators or-motors of this type which are capable of both linear and rotary drive and especially combined linear and rotary steppers or stepper motors. rotary stepper motors are widely known and used in various technical fields the common form of such a stepper motor is one that operates in 200 discrete steps, the motor having a toothed.rotor and a stator with poles constructed appropriately for this number of steps. < examples of rotary stepper motors are in u.s. patents such as nos 2,93-1,929; 2,982,872; 3,434,014. stepper motors that operate in steps are commonly used in connection with digital equipment wherein pulses are applied to the stepper motor which used as an actuator. linear electromagnetic actuators are also known in the #art, such devices embodying linearly movable armature members having teeth which are associated with a stato.r having poles and windings which are energizable to cause the movable member.to move in the direction of its length. an exam#ple of such a device is illustrated in u.s. patent no, 3,894,275. devices are known in the prior which are combÃ¬nei rotary and linear motors or positioning mechanisms. illustrative of such devices are the following u.s. patents: 3,394,295; 3,430,120; 3,441,819;, 3,745,433; 3,851,196 and 3,889,165. the latter patent utilizes a cylindrical movable member which has teeth both on the inside and the outside associated with stators having windings so arranged as to produce both linear and rotary movement. all of the prior art devices are lacking in specific effectiveness, capabilities, #implicity and compactness of constructional arr.angemeflts whereby to realize efficiency and effectiveness of both the linear and rotary movements. it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved linear and rot'a'ry- device. according to the resent invention we provide a linear and-rotary device including in combination, a first member having an axis-'-which is movable and which is mounted to be movable angularly about its axis and to be movable axially, said member having means formed on its surface which provide angularly spaced teeth, said last means being constructed so that axially spaced teeth are provided as well as ngularly spaced teeth on the surface of the said member, stator means having poles and including windings and having a circular central opening in which the movable member is disposed so that the sseeth of#the movable member can move adjacent to the poles of the stator means, the stator means including poles and windings which are spaced axially, 'the said stator means being constructed such that energizing certain axially spaced stator windings, the movable member can be caused to move axially and whereby the capability is provided that by energizing stator windings that are angularly displaced from each other the said movable member is caused to rotate about its axis. a preferred form of the invention takes the form of linear and rotary stepper. an elongated cylindric,al movable armature member is provided which is mounted for both axial and angular movement.
