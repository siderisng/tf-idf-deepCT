<ABSTRACT>
a water-saving faucet, particularly for kitchen sinks  and bathroom basins, is provided.  the faucet comprises  at least one water valve (60, 62), a sink-sweeping movable  spout (20) and a spout valve means (12) coupled to a  spout.  the open and closed states of the faucet are  controllable by the movable spout and the open state of  the faucet is substantially unaffected by the sweep of  the movable spout across the effective area of the sink or  basin.  an attachment for converting a standard mixing  faucet having a movable spout into a water-saving mixing  faucet is also provided.
