<ABSTRACT>
an insulated-gate field effect transistor which is adapted  for detecting and measuring various chemical properties  such as ion activity in a solution.  the transistor has a  chemically sensitive layer (22) which overlies a portion of a  substrate (2) other than that covered by the gate insulator (6).   when this chemically sensitive layer (22) is exposed to a  solution (32) or other substance, the electric field in the  substrate (2) is modified which changes the conductance of  the channel between a source region (4) and a drain region  (8).  the change in conductance is related to the chemical  exposure and can be detected with a current meter (52).
