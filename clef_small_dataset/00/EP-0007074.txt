<ABSTRACT>
For common operation in a preferably with a plurality of operational amplifiers (V₁, V₂ ,.,, Vn), the amplifier assembly for a plurality of useful signals to be processed (E₁ E₂ ,.,. en), which are superimposed by a larger interference signal, is provided, the uses signals, for example, to supply physiological measurements for EEG and ECG measurements, to positive inputs (+) of the single amplifier, while the negative inputs (-) each connected to the connection point of a two-resistant voltage divider (R₁, R₂) which are each between the respective amplifier output and a potential reference point (P). This reference potential is determined by the output of another opera tension amplifier (V₄), at the positive input is supplied with a superimposed by the interference signal overlaid reference signal (UE4), while its negative input at the connection point of a two-resistant voltage divider (R₂ ', R₁ ') Is connected between the output of this further operational amplifier and the potential reference point (P). For measuring signal amplifiers, z. B for physiological measurement signals, therefore, the equal time reduction already takes place in the preamplifier stages, so that separate differential levels can be saved for interference signal suppression.
