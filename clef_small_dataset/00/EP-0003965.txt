<ABSTRACT>
resinous polymer sheet material having surface decorative  effects.  the material is made by applying to a potentially  foamable resinous composition (16) a printing composition  layer (18) forming a pattern and then applying to said printing  composition layer a resinous polymer wear layer (22) having  therein reactive polymerizable and cross-linkable monomeric  materials.  there is included in areas (20) of the sheet material  a polymerization initiator, perferably dicumylperoxide, capable  of initiating a polymerization and cross-linking reaction  of the monomeric materials, and the surface of the wear layer  is heated in order to develop the foam, preferably also  mechanically embossed, and to bring about such reaction at  the areas of the polymerization initiator.  the melt viscosity of  the wear layer at said areas is thereby increased so that said  areas will have a different appearance than the other area of  said wear layer.
