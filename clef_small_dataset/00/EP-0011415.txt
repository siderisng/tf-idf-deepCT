<ABSTRACT>
film forming compositions are disclosed which can be  utilized to make vapor barrier films having low water vapor  transmission, good flame retardancy and low smoke genera­ tion characteristics.  the compositions contain an internally  plasticized vinyl chloride copolymer resin as a major polymer  component, rather than an externally plasticized vinyl  chloride polymer, or a blend of a vinyl chloride polymer and  chlorinated polyethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
title film forming composition and vapor barrier made therefrom the present invention relates to a film folding composition which can be utilized to make vapour barrier films suitable for use in building construction and vapor barrier film so formed. vapor barrier films are specialized products which are commonly used in building construction to retard the transmission of water vapor into or from the interior of the building. they should have a balance of the following characteristics: a low water vapor transmission value; good flame retardance and low smoke generation properties; good low temperature flexibility; good tensile and tear strength; and easy processibility for such forming operations as calendering, extrusion casting, extrusion blow molding, and solvent casting. one approach to making such films has been the use of an externally plasticized vinyl'chloride polymer resin as the polymer component of such films in conjunction with appropiate amounts of flame retardants, fillers, lubricants, stabilizers, and like ingredients (e.g., see film no. 1 in table 1 of u.s. patent no. 3,983,290). although such films show resistance to water vapor transmission, the presence of externally added plasticizer gives rise to the possibility of plasticizer migration and resulting embrittlement of the product with the passage of time. another approach to forming such films has been to incoporate chlorinated polyethylene in the polymer component, together with the vinyl chloride polymer, in an eff@rt to reduc@ the amcun@ of plast@' @@ needed in the composition. the presence of plasticizer is believed to contribute to water vapor transmission in vapor barrier films (see, kogyo kagaku zasshi, vol. 64, 349-355 (1961), abstracted in chem. abstr., vol. 57, 4875 f). some recent examples of vapor barrier film constructions of this type are shown in: u.s. patent no. 3,983,290; belgian patent no. 855,443; and u.s. patent no. 3,872,041. the present invention provides a flame retardant, heat stabilized film forming composition containing a polymeric component, said composition being adapted to be used to form a vapor barrier film having low water vapor transmission, good flame retardancy, low smoke generation, and good low temperature flexibility characteristics, char-acterised in that the predominant ingredient in said polim,erc component is an internally plasticized vinyl chloride copolymer resin. it also provides a vapor barrier film made from such composition. a preferred internally plasticized resin for use in such a comp@- sition comprises from about 50% to about 85, by weight, vinyl chloride, from about 3% to 47%, by weight, of a c6-c10 alkyl acrylate, and from about 47% to about 3%, by weight, of a bis(hydrocarbyl) vinylphosphonate. the film forming composition of the present invention typically comprises the following components a) from about 40% to about 70%, by weight of the composition, of a polymer component comprising a predominant amount, for example, in excess of about 45%, by weight of the polymer component, of an internally plasticized resin, which will be described in greater detail below; b) from about 08 to about 35%, by weight of th± composition, of at least one filler material; c) from about 11
