<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus permitting the use of heat as a therapeutic  principle for the neuroarticular pathologies (arthrosis, arthÂ­ ritis, sciatica etc. ) comprising an independent source of heat  (20) which develops namely heat by catalytic reaction of a fuel  and a belt (37) for supporting said source adaptable to that  zone of the body which it is desired to treat.  a layer of material  resistant to heat of well determined thickness and thermal  conductivity is interposed between the body and the source of  heat (20) to regulate the surface temperature fixed by the  therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
independent warming apparatus in particular for neuroarti cular pathology therapy. the present invention refers to an independent warming apparatus in particular suitable for neuroarticular pathology therapy. in the medical field the use of heat is known as a therapeutic principle in all neuroarticular pathologies such as, for example, arthrosis, arthritis, neuroradicolitis, sciatica and it is also known that the contribution of heat assumes the maximum efficacy when the patient can at the same time keep the painful joint in motion. the apparatus existing at the present time on the market are constituted by sources of heat which normally are not independent and therefore may be used by the patient only in positions of rest; there are two drawbacks constituted firstly by the lesser efficiency of the supply of heat and secondly by the obvious necessity of reducing the supply time in order not to cause excessive loss of time. the invention, the subject of the present patent, proposes to present an independent heating apparatus so as to ensure a supply of constant heat for a long period of time at the temperature most adapted to the therapy. another object of the invention is that of realizing an apparatus which may be applied to the patient rapidly and safely and allow complete freedom of movement of same, a non final scope of the present invention is that of making available an independent heating apparatus which is easily obtainable from elements commonly found in the trade and which in addition is able to give the fullest guarantees of reliability and safety in operation. the objects mentioned and others which will follow better in the following are obtained by an independent heating apparatus in particular for neuroarticular pathology therapies according to the invention comprising essentially an in dependent source of heat; a layer of heat resistant material applied to the opposite faces of the source of heat intended to be arranged parallel on the surface of the body of the patient so as to determine the surface temperature fixed for the therapy, the said material being arranged on one of the two faces of clasping means with holding means and keeping in position of the source of heat according to the zone of the body which it is desired to subject to the therapy. these and other working constructional features of the invention are made evident better from the detailed description which follows having as its object an apparatus according to the invention and illustrated in the attached dra- wings in which figure 1 shows the independent source of heat formed by a benzine heater suitable for the pocket covered with two layers of wool felt; figure 2 shows the supporting belt of the source of heat in the lumber zone; figure 3 shows the application of the apparatus in the lumber zone; figure 4 shows the supporting belt of the source of heat of the cervical zone; figure 5 shows the application of the apparatus in the cervical zone. referring to the
