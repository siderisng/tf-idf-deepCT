<ABSTRACT>
trans-4a-phenyl and substituted phenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6  7,7a-octahydro-1h-2-pyrindines of the formula    wherein:  r1 is hydrogen, c₁-c₈ alkyl, ch₂r₃,    in which:   r₃ is c₂-c₇ alkenyl, c₃-c₆ cycloalkyl, furyl, or tetrahydrofuryl;   r₄ and r₅ independently are hydrogen, c₁-c₃ alkyl, or  halogen;   n is 0, 1, 2, or 3;   m is 0 or 1, except that when m is o, n is other than o;   x is co, choh, ch=ch, s, or o, except that when n is o,   x is other than s or o;   r₂ is hydrogen, hydroxy, c₁-c₃ alkoxy, or c₁-c₃ alkanoyloxy;  and  the non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition  salts thereof, are useful as analgesic agents having mixed  agonist and antagonist properties.  the compounds can  be prepared by reacting a 4a-aryl-2-substituted-3,4,4a,  5,6,7-hexahydro-2-pyrindine with hydrogen and platinum  oxide.
