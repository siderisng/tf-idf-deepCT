<ABSTRACT>
cleaning machine with means for blasting the goods to  be cleaned.  inside a liquid container (23) there is provided a  liquid-permeable cassette providing a magazine (38) for the  granules and connected to a bottom outlet (36) in a treatment  chamber (12) wherein the blasting shall take place.  the cas­ sette is connected by a valve-controlled opening (45) to the  suction side of pump means (25) for sucking-in liquid from the  liquid container via the cassette while carrying granules there­ from, and for supplying the liquid containing granules to the  treatment chamber from which the granules are again supplied  to the cassette through the bottom outlet.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
cleaning machine the invention relates to a cleaning machine with means for blasting the goods to be cleaned- by means of liquid containing granules, comprising a treatment chamber for receiving the goods, a liquid container, pump means the suction side of which is connected to the liquid container for sucking-in liquid, nozzle means connected to the pressure side of the pump means for ejecting liquid towards the goods in the treatment chamber, and means for supplying granules to liquid supplied to the nozzle means, and for separating granules from #liquid ejected from the nozzle means. cleaning machines in which blasting of the goods to be cleaned is applied are used for instance for washing beavilysoiled goods with adhering food residues which are difficult to resolve and remove only by spraying liquid containing conventional dishwashing detergents. in a prior art embodiment (das 1.148,360) of a dishwashing machine of this type, commonly called heavy-duty dishwashing machine, the granules are located on a grid in the treatment chamber below the goods to be washed, and by forcing liquid from below through the grid said granules are thrown towards the goods together with the liquid. the arrangement is not satisfactory because the liquid containing granules cannot without difficulty be directed towards the goods to be washed in such a manner that an optimally effective cleaning of the goods is achieved. in another embodiment (u.s. 1,76-1,492) granules formed as balls are introduced by means of an injector into the liquid when it is ejected towards the goods to be washed, and are then separated from the liquid again by means of a grid when the liquid leaves the goods, to be forwarded to the injector by means of separate conveyor means in order to be introduced into the liquid again. such an arrangement is effective per se, but the conveyor means provides a complication because it fails easily during operation of the machine and can hardly operate with relatively small granules. the invention aims at providing a cleaning machine of the type initially referred to in which the granules are supplied and separated by means of a constructively simple arrangement in a reliable manner also as far as small granules are concerned, and which at the same time provlaesthe possibility to direct the liquid containing granules by means of the nozzle means in the most suitable angle of incidence towards the goods in order to obtain an optimally effective cleaning of the goods. in order to achieve this the cleaning machine according to the invention is characterized in that the last-mentioned means comprises a liquid-permeable container which is located inside the liquid container with a bottom outlet in the treatment chamber connecting to the liquid container via the liquid-permeable container, and in that this container is connected through a valve-controlled opening to the suction side of the pump means for supplying the granules to the liquid through this opening such that liquid containing the granules is sucked-up and circulated by the pump means, or alternatively
