<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for annealing cold rolled tapes of metal, in particular of steel, having the shape of coils (2, 3, 4) within which the windings are directly contacting one another, the coils (2, 3, 4) being, within this device, heated during a heating stage and, after a thermal retardation for maintaining the temperature, cooled during a cooling stage, said device comprising a protective hood (15) enclosing the coil or coils (2, 3, 4) and said device having connected to the exterior space (14) defined by the protective hood (15) connected the suction side of a cooling blower (24) and having connected to the interior space (27) enclosed by the coil or coils the pressure side of said cooling blower (24), a gas cooler (27) being provided in series connection with the cooling blower, characterized in that, the exterior space (14) delimited by the protective hood (15) is closed with respect to the interior space (17) enclosed by the coil or coils (2, 3, 4) by the housing of a circulating blower (8) formed of a centrifugal blower, said circulating blower being coaxially arranged relative to the coil or coils (2, 3, 4) and having its impeller (38) arrestable during the cooling stage and the pressure side of the cooling blower being connectable with the interior space (17) enclosed by the coil or coils via the impeller space (18) of the impeller (38) of the circulating blower (8).
