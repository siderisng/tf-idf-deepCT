<ABSTRACT>
the present means therefor comprise a continuous  resilient strip (3) incorporating a channel (12) by which it is  fitted about the periphery of the additional pane (6) to have a  section (11) standing proud of a face (6a) thereof.  the  additional pane (6) is marginally undersized relative to the  existing pane (7) whereby, together with the seal (3)  mounted thereon, pane (6) can be positioned in face to face  juxtaposition to pane (7) with strip (3) interposed therebetween.   by way of either a non-return valve (17) in pane (6) or  an hypodermic type insertion either through seal (3) or  between seal (3) and pane (7), the cavity (13) between the  panes (6, 7) is partially evacuated.  the resultant suction  sealling impinges the panes (6) and (7) to seal (3) and thus  together to provide a double glazed installation.  the same  method, means can be used in production of double glazed  units.
