<ABSTRACT>
in accordance with the present invention, there is provided  herein improved glass fiber dispersions for making  uniform glass fiber mats by the wet-laid process.  the well  dispersed glass fiber compositions of this invention usually  are prepared by mixing chopped glass fibers in water with  a small amount of an amine oxide surfactant.  as a feature  of the invention, the dispersions may be formed at relatively  high glass fiber consistencies.  the resultant dispersions  then are used to make very high quality glass fiber  mats at high rates of production.
