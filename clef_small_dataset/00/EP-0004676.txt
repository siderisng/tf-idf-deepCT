<ABSTRACT>
ammonia, oxygen e. g. , as air, and a ketone react in  contact with a catalyst such as porous, amorphous silica or  alumina which may or may not have a coating to form an  oxime, at temperatures such as 50°-500°c.  the oximes have  known utilities, including uses as oxidation inhibitors and as  intermediates for production of amides.  in particular, when  the ketone is cyclohexanone, the cyclohexanone oxime in  the reaction product can further be converted to the cyclic  amide, caprolactam, e. g.  by contacting the product with an  aluminosilicate catalyst having average pore diameter of at  least 7 angstroms, especially a molecular sieve, suitably  downstream in the same reaction vessel.  caprolactam is the  monomer starting material for nylon 6.
