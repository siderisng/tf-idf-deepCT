<DESCRIPTION>
jet ink composition the invention relates jet ink and particularly an aqueous jet printing ink for printing with a jet ink printing system. one of the main problems with jet inks is thati when the ink jet printer is not being used for an extended period of time, ink in the nozzle dries out, causing plugging of the nozzle. this invention comprises a new class of liquids which when used in proper amounts alone or in combination with other humectants, overcome nozzle clogging problems. the principle underlying jet printing with ink is based on driving ink through a fine nozzle of metal or glass so that uniform ink droplets are ejected from the nozzle tip. these ink droplets are charged and electrostatically deflected with a deflecting electrode, arranged in front of the nozzle, so that symbols are printed with a preliminarily determined matrix. in this printing process the ink in the nozzle is divided in fine ink droplets and the direction of the ink jet is controlled by deflecting plates or through nozzle movement. this printing process is highly dependent on the properties of the ink. the ink must be capable of forming stable ink droplets under pressure and under an electrical field, and have a high deflection sensitivity. further, the ink must readily emerge from the nozzle. in addition, clogging of the nozzle by drying ink must be prevented. commercial jet inks are divided in aqueous and nonaqueous inks. nonaqueous inks have the disadvantage of low stability ink droplets because of low surface tension. as a result, while in flight the ink droplets form a fog. in addition, such a nonaqueous ink has a high electrical resistance and a low defelcting sensitivity. at the same time, these ink droplets are particularly unstable under a high electrical charge. consequently, it has been difficult to print clear and distinct symbols with this method. the concepts of the present invention reside in a new and improved ink composition suitable for use in jet printing comprising an aqueous solution of a water-soluble dye and a humectant consisting of at least one member of the group consisting of organic phosphonates and organic phosphites. dialkyl alkylphosphonates are a group of stable organic phosphorus esters possessing unique properties and offering considerable potential for commercial exploitation. dialkyl alkylphosphonates include: dimethyl methylphosphonate dimethyl ethylphosphonate d ibutyl butylphosphonate bis(2-ethylhexyl) 2-ethylhexylphosphonate these materials are neutral esters of phosphonic acids and are clear, colorless, mobile liquids with very mild, characteristic odors. they are similar in many respects to the trialkyl phosphates which have found a wide variety of commercial applications. the significant structural difference between the two is that the phosphonates have one alkyl radical attached directly to the phosphorus atom by a carbon-phosphorus bond. this structural difference gives the phosphonates several advantages over the phosphates: among these are higher flash points, lower toxicity, and greater thermal stability. other significant differences in comparison with the corresponding phosphates are that the phosphonates have one less oxygen atom in the molecule, lower molecular
