<ABSTRACT>
human antibodies are produced specifically from human  lymphocyte cell lines grown in vitro.  the cells utilized to  initiate the cell lines are obtained either in vivo by sensitizing  a human host with the antigen to the antibody desired or in  vitro by sensitizing human lymphocytes with the antigen and  isolating the thus sensitized cells.  the isolated cells are  transformed with lymphotropic virus and are grown to  establish a continuous cell line capable of producing the  human antibody specifically.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a process for forming antibodies and more particularly to a process for fcm- ing antibodies utilizing continuous human cell lines. presently, antibodies are produced routinely by injecting an antigen into an animal, bleeding the animal after a suitable incubation time and isolating the antibody from the serum. since the antibodies thereby produced are heterologous, there is the attend- ant risk of anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions. furthermore, the immunogenic antibodies cannot be used repeatedly in the same patient for diagnosis and therapy. prior to the present invention, continuous lymphoid cell lines from various sources including plasmacytomas and lymphomas of human origin have been established which synthesize and secrete inrmunoglo- bulin(s). unfortunately, none of the antibody produced in this manner has a desired predetermined specificity. for example, a prior attempt to initiate human lymphoblastoid cell lines in vitro capable of synthesizing specific antibody yielded cell lines synthesizing gamma globulin which was not of the desired specificity. however, continuous cell lines synthesizing antibody with a specificity directed toward a bacterial vaccine have been established by in vitro viral infection of cultures from the spleen of a rabbit hyperimmunized with the bacterial vaccine. in addition, murine lm?hoid cell lines yielding antibody of predetermined specificity have been established by fusing mouse myeloma cells with normal mouse lymphocytes¯¯from immunized animals. however, like antibodies obtained from the blood sera of non-human animals, the antibodies produced from these cell lines suffer the disadvantages associated with all heterologous antibodies. thus, prior to the present invention, there is no procedure available for producing in vitro human antibodies of a predetermined specificity from a continuous cell line. it would be highly desirable to produce human-antibody of desired specificity in vitro from a continuous cell line. the-huxan antibody obtained would be safer for use than heterologous antibody since the risk of anaphylaxis are other allergic reactions would be eliminated. continuous production of human antibody would be of enormou- benefit in the prophylaxis and treatment of certain human infectious diseases, particularly viral, where te effectiveness of present-day chemotherapy has. not teen demonstrated conclusively as well as the neutralization of effects of endogenous hormones extrinsically idministered toxins or drugs or in vivo diagnosis using radioactively labeled antibodies. the vesicle for producing large amounts of the antibody in vitro would provide a source of antibody which is no; antigenic and which could be utilized repeatedly ir the seme patient for diagnosis and therapy. according to the present invention there is provided a process for producing a ht:an antibody which comprises: a. administering the antigea for the antibody to human lymphocyte cells to :;:simulate produc --tion of said antibody by said :ells, b. transforming said cells with a lympho tropic virus, c. growing said transformec ells in vitro, d. concentrating the transi:aned cells cap able of producing said antibody specifically from other transformed cells that produce immunoglo- bulin without said antibody, e. growing said concentrated transformed cells in a growth medium to form continuous cell lines, and f. recovering said antibody
