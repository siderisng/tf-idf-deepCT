<ABSTRACT>
1.  rotating tap head (1) designed to be inserted in a tap body (2) and applied to a fluid inlet (4) communicating with the base of this tap body (2), the head comprising at least one annular sealing joint (9) applied to the fluid inlet (4), a lower sealing disc (8) which is fixed and urged towards the sealing joint (9) and which is traversed by at least one fluid flow aperture (12a, 12b) and has a plane polished upper surface (8b) on which may slide, with a rotary movement, and in order to adjust the rate of flow of the fluid traversing this lower disc (8) by complete, partial or non closure of its flow aperture(s) (12a, 12b), inner plane polished surface (7) of an upper sealing disc (7) which is rotationally rigid, by means of supplementary drive projections (15, 16) with a manual rotary control element (6) on the exterior of the tap body (2) and whose lower portion (6a) is, with the sealing discs (7, 8) housed within a substantially cylindrical housing (5, 5a, 5b) having two lateral apertures (14a, 14b) and two longitudinal lugs (17a, 17b, 170a, 170b), this head further comprising two deflectors (13a, 13b) for the lateral deflection towards the lateral apertures (14a, 14b) of the housing (5, 5a, 5b), the fluid arriving from the bottom, and at least one fixed stop engaging with at least one sector which is rotationally rigid with the control element in order to limit the possible angle of rotation of this element, characterized in that the longitudinal lugs (17a, 17b, 170a, 170b) define two spaces between each other constituting the two lateral apertures (14a, 14b) of the housing (5), in that the upper disc (7) has at least one flange (21) constituting an angular limitation sector engaging with a corresponding lateral aperture (14a, 14b) of the housing and which may contact a corresponding longitudinal lug (17a, 17b, 170a, 170b) constituting the said fixed stop, and in that the upper disc (7) has two diametrically opposite recesses (13a, 13b), provided on its periphery, extending from its inner surface and over one portion only of its thickness, and acting in particular as deflectors.
