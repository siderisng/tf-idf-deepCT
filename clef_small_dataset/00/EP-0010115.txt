<ABSTRACT>
the security seal comprises a member with a barbed entry at one end and an exit at the other.  a closure member is held captive and protruding from the exit of the first member.  the closure has a barb at one end, allowing entry but not withdrawal from the barbed entry.  the captive end of the closure can be enlarged to prevent it pulling through the exit.  the closure can be slotted, to assist in the collapse of the member as the barbed end is forced through the entry.  the closure can have a readily severable region.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: security seal description field of the invention this invention concerns security seals for bags and containers. such seals are used for money bags and for containers used in the discs tribution and bulk handling trades (e.g. wholesale and retail food distribution). this type of seal does not rely on strength for security but solely on the fact that one of the parts has to be severed in order to gain access to the interior of the bag or container and consequently at the end of a journey it can be readily determined whether or not the latter has been tampered with. background to the invention one type of container with which such a seal can be used comprises a bag having a single open end and having two parallel lines of holes which extend substantially parallel to the open end of the bag a short distance therefrom. the bag can be sealed by folding the bag over between the two lines of holes so that the holes in the two lines are aligned, folding the bag in a concertina manner in a direction perpendicular to the first fold so that the pairs of holes are all aligned in the direction parallel to the direction of the original fold and pushing a sealing member through the aligned holes. such a bag will herein be be referred to as an eyelet bag. hitherto the sealing member has typically comprised a rod or wire or chain. the present invention provides a replacement for such devices which can be sealed without the need for special tools or keys etc. and which will reveal at the end of transit whether or not the seal has in any way been tampered with or broken during transit or storage. security seals are also used by companies and authorities who req e a security system to be seen to be operated with regard to their goods when in transit or in storage. lo this end it is known to use lengths of metal or wire or plastics material and to thread such devices through a pair of lugs associated with the fastening of a door or doors to a container and to seal the two ends of the device so that one end cannot be pulled away from the other end without leaving t7ae form of damage which can be readily seen upon inspection thereby indicating trst the seal has been tampered with.. one of the lugs would typically be formed on the door frame and the other on the door or alternatively one lug may be on one door and the other on another door of a double-door unit. such security seals are only generally capable of being used once and whilst this is of no great disadvantage where packages are being shipped for example by the post office from one point to another this does represent a disadvantage where the same type of security seal is being used to indicate that a load in a

title: security seal    claims  1. a security seal comprising a first member (10) one end of which is formed with a barbed entry (32) and the other end with an exit (16), a closure member (40) which is held captive in, and protrudes from the exit (16) in the first member, the closure member being formed at least at one end with a barb   (44,46)    by   which    it is adapted to be inserted into the barbed entry (32) from which it cannot be withdrawn once it has been introduced thereinto.    2. a security seal according to claim 1 in which the captive end of the closure member (40) is enlarged to prevent it   from    being pulled through the exit (16) in the first member   (it).       3.   h    security seal according to claim 1 in which the barbed region of the closure member is formed with a slot (48) to assist in the collapse   the    member as the barbed end is forced through the barbed entry (32).    4. a security seal according to claim 1 in which the closure member (40) includes a region of reduced cross-section (62) at which it can be readily severed.    5. a security seal according to claim 1 further comprising an aperture (34) in the wall of the first member beyond the barbed entry (32) and a passage (30) through which a severed leading end of the closure member (40) can pass to leave the first member.    6. a security seal according to claim 1 in which the closure member   (123)    is formed with barbs   (13e)    at its leading end and at intervals along its length.    7. a security seal according to claim 6 in which the first member (110) is formed with a window   (116,12)    along some of its length to allow barbed sections contained therein to be seen.      8. a security seal according to claim 6 in which apertured discs (144) are located around the closure member (128) between each two adjoining barbs (136), the outside diameter of each disc (144) being such that it can pass through the exit (142) in the first member (110) but cannot pass through the closure aperture (134) thereof.     9. a security seal according to claim 6 in which the cross-section of the closure member (24) is increased between each two adjoining barbs (242,243), the dimensions of the increase in cross-section   (265)    being such as to permit it to pass through the exit (216) but to prevent it from entering the closure aperture   (252)    in the said first member (210).    10. a security seal according to claim 2 in which the first member includes a further aperture (264) in the wall thereof to allow the enlarged end (214) of the second member (240) to be removed from the first member.
