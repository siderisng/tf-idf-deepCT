<ABSTRACT>
the lock enables a door to be bolted simultaneously at  the top and bottom by a single operating handle.  a deadlock  mechanism is incorporated operable by a conventional cylin­ der lock (31).  in one arrangement the deadlock and the bolting  mechanism can be operated from both sides of the door (10).  the basic mechanism of the lock consists of an operating  tangent plate (20) connected by pin and slot mechanism to a  second tangent plate (24).  each tangent plate (20 , 24) is in  turn connected by a pin and slot mechanism to a slider plate  (21,28) and each slider plate (21,28) is connected to a bolt  (16,17 respectively).  the deadlock includes a slidable locking  plate (44) moveable by a cam mechanism (32,32a) operated  by a cylinder lock (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
lock for sliding patio door this invention relates to locks of the type which have a single operating mechanism to activate bolts at two spaced locations and in particular the invention relates to locks suitable for sliding patio doors. an object of the invention is to provide a compact lock mechanism which enables a patio door, or a window, for examp'e, to be bolted simultaneously at two different local onus (such as the top and bottom of a patio door) by a single movement of an operating handle. the lock of this invention is of elongated construction so as to occupy the minimum width so that it will fit into a very narrow door or window frame. according to the invention a lock comprises an operating member in the form of a first pivoted tangent plate connected by a pin and slot mechanism to a first slider plate adapted to be connected to a first bolt member, the tangent plate being connected by a second pin and slot mechanism to a second pivoted tangent plate in such manner that clockwise rotational movement of the first tangent plate causes anti-clockwi de rotational movers-en a tne second tangent plate and vice-versa, the second tent plate also being connected by a pin and slot mechanism to a second slider plate adapted to be connected to a second bolt member, so that rotation of the spera'ing member causes the two slider plates to move in opposite directions. the lock is characterised by this, that it is of compact, elongated construction, the first bolt member zit at the end of the lock remote from the first tangent plate, and the second bolt member being at the ed of the lock remote from the second tangent plate. tne lock is further characterised by this, that the two slider plates are arranged parallel to each other and the pin employed to connect one slider plate to its tangent plate passes through an aperture in the other slider plate. optionally, there may be a deadlock mechanism comprising a plate which has a locking projection or foot adapted to be moved into a position in which it inhibits movement of the lock mechanism. said locking projection or foot may be adapted to block movement of one of the pins connected to one of the tangent plates. the deadlock locking plate may be moveable by engagement of a rotary cam with a cam surface on the plate such as to move the locking plate to cause said projection or foot to inhibit movement of the lock mechanism. said rotary cam may be operable by a conventional cylinder lock. the co ting action e f te lock andior the deadlock ac tic' may be operable from either side of the lock. prereratly t-e !.t ,cludes a lock operating handle and a fixed han for sliding the door, the operating handle being at one end of the lock and being small compared with the fixed handle which occupies substantially the remaining length

   clait4s:      1. a lock comprising an operating member in the form of a first pivoted   t .ge-t    plate (20) connected by a pin and slot mechanism (22, 23) to a first slider plate   (2')    adapted to be connected to a first bolt member (16), the tangent plate (20) being connected by a second pin and slot mechanism (25, 26) to a second pivoted tangent plate (24) in such a manner that clockwise rotational movement of the first tangent plate (20) causes anticlockwise rotational movement of the second tangent plate (24) and vice-versa, the second tangent plate (24) also being connected by a pin and slot mechanism (29, 30) to a second slider plate (28) adapted to be connected to a second bolt member (17), so that rotation of the operating member causes the two slider plates to move in opposite directions, characterised by this,  that the lock is of elongated construction and the first bolt member (16) is at the end of the lock remote from the first tangent plate (20), and the second bolt member (17) is at the end of the lock remote from the second tangent plate (24).   2. a lock according to claim 1 and characterised by this, that the two slider plates (21, 28) are arranged parallel to each other and the pin (23) employed to connect one slider plate (21) to its tangent plate (20) passes through a slot (23a) in the other slider plate   (28).      3. a lock according to any preceding claim and characterised by this, that there is a deadlock mechanism comprising a plate (44) which has a locking projection or foot (45) adapted to be moved into a position in which it inhibits movement of the lock mechanism.     4. a lock according to claim 3 and characterised by this, that said locking projection or foot (44) is adapted to block movement of one of the pins (26) connected to one of the   tangent    plates (24).   5. a lock according to claim 3 or claim 4 and characterised by this, that the deadlock locking plate (46) is moveable   b    engagement of a rotary cam (32) with a cam surface   (33ì    on the plate such as to move the locking plate to cause said projection or foot (44) to inhibit movement of the lock mechanism.   6. a lock according to claim 6 and characterised by this, that said rotary can (32) is operable by a conventional cylinder lock (31).   7. a lock according to any preceding claim and characterised by this, that the lock and/or the deadlock are operable from either side of the lock.   8. a lock according to any preceding claim and characterised by this, that said slider plates (21, 28) are connected to rods (16,17) which act as said bolt members, the bolt members cooperating with keep members (14, 15) remote from the lock.    9. a lock according to claim 8, in combination with a sliding door   cnaracterised    by this, that said bolt members (14, 15) are located respectively at the top and bottom of the door.   10. a lock according to claim 8, in combination with a hinged window characterised by this, that the bolt members (14, 15) being located at opposite sides or at opposite ends of the window.     11.   a    lock according to any preceding claim and characterised   u,      o    lock operating handle (18) located adjacent one end of the lock said handle (18) being stall compare   witr,      @ixed    handle (19) for sliding the door which occuples substantially the remaining lengt of the lock.
