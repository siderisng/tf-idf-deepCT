<ABSTRACT>
a compressed-gas-operated reciprociating-piston de­ vice, e. g.  a concrete breaker, rock drill or chipping hammer,  has a cylinder component of composite construction, compris­ ing a rigid inner metal tube (40, 40a) in which the piston (12,  12a) reciprocates and a moulded outer sleeve (41, 41a) of rub­ ber or plastics material, e. g.  polyurethane, which surrounds  the tube over the majority of its length and is bonded thereto.   the sleeve has three integral moulded longitudinal ribs (43,  43a) in which are moulded longitudinal passages (32, 32a) for  transmission of compressed air to the cylinder interior.  an out­ er tubular muffler (50, 50a) of rubber or plastics material sur­ rounds the composite cylinder component and defines a  sound-reducing path for exhaust gas from the cylinder to the  atmosphere.  the exhaust gas is discharged into two spaces  (83, 84, 87 or 83a, 84a) defined between two pairs of adjacent  ribs (43, 43a) of the sleeve within the muffler, these two spa­ ces forming part of an expansion chamber in the muffler.  this  expansion chamber communicates with the atmosphere either  directly through exhaust ports (52), or via a  restriction (86a) and a second expansion chamber (88a, 87a)  in the muffler to a final duct (91a) leading to the exhaust open­ ing (52a) and formed in the thickness of the muffler wall.   the combination of ribbed sleeve and muffler  provides improved sound-damping and exhaust silencing for  the device.
