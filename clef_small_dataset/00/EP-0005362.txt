<ABSTRACT>
a body for the storage of heat or for the storage of  coolness is, in its solid phase, a conglomerate of a mass  of crystalline particles of a salt-hydrate, and a rigid cellular  support structure in the form of a crust formed by a chemical  reaction with the surfaces of the crystalline particles.   by way of example, strontium nitrate is reacted with uniformly  sized crystalline particles of sodium sulfate decahydrate  to form an integral support crust structure of the  compound strontium sulfate, which compound is insoluble  in water.  when the crystalline particles are transformed  to the liquid phase, the liquid is confined within the cells  of the support structure.  the body is enclosed in a moisture  impermeable skin to prevent evaporation of the water of  crystallization in the liquid phase.  several methods of fabricating  such a body are disclosed, including the mixing of  the crystalline particles with a solution of soluble strontium  nitrate in sufficient quantity to provide the desired  supporting crust structure, pouring that mixture into a suitable  mold, and providing the desired moisture impervious  skin for the cast body.
