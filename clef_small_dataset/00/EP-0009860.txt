<ABSTRACT>
a device containing a length of elongate material, especially  a desoldering wick of braided wire having a coating of  rosin thereon, comprises a unitary annular body molded of  plastic material including a central hub (30), first and second  annular sides, with respective continuous rims, the hub,  sides and rims defining an annular chamber receiving the  coil therein, the rims defining a continuous annular slot  therebetween communicating with the outer periphery of the  annular chamber to permit the free end portion of the length  of elongate material to extend therethrough in controllably  engaged fashion.  each annular side has a plurality of annularly  spaced portions (34) defining a plurality of axially  extending openings (36) communicating with the annular  chamber so as to provide for the free exterior communication  of the exposed surfaces of the coil, with the annularly  spaced portions of each side axially accessible through the  openings of the other side.  thus a one-piece molding is provided  enabling ventilation to the coil for drying the rosin after  the desoldering wick is wound on the coil.
