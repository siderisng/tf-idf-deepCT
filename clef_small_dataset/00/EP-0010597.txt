<ABSTRACT>
Gutter for axial feeding of rod-shaped workpieces to machining machines such as direct maschi nen and peeling machines. It is feed rin NEN, which open upwards and to which the workpiece (11) is supplied from above to its longitudinal extent. When holding a new workpiece (11) into the channel, this does not fall directly on the bottom of the gutter, but is started by a plurality of bands (4), which are stretched above the bottom of the gutter. The channel is in cross section of three tread segments (1 2, 3). To open the channel, two segments (1, 2) of the gutter cross section are movable. The bands (4) are thus suspended on the movable profile segments (1, 2) of the grooves cross section that they prevent an impact of the workpiece on the stationary lower segment (3) when the groove opened and that when the groove is closed, the bands (4) completely release the cross section of the gutter.
