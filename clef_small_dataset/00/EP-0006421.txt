<ABSTRACT>
method for drying polyolefins comprising bringing polyolefins having a total content of at least one of hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms of 100 ppm by weight to 2% by weight into contact with an inert gas (e g nitrogen gas having virtually no hydrocarbon and/or no alcohol) in counterflow in a sil @ type through-flow drying apparatus, particularly a mult-s @@ type through-flow drying apparatus.  said method gives polyolefins having a @@@@tent of the hydrocarbons and/or alcohols of less than 100 ppm by weight with lower energy consumption

<DESCRIPTION>
method for drying polyolefins and apparatus therefor the present invention relates to a method for drying polyolefins and an apparatus suitable therefor. ore particularly, it relates to an improved method of drying polyolefins which is characteristic in that it satisfactorily reduces a concentration of one or more of hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms which remain in the polyolefins dried by conventional drying methods, and to an apparatus suitable for the method. when polyolefins are produced in a hydrocarbon .medium in the presence of a catalyst containing as one of the components a compound of a transition metal, suc as ziegler catalyst, they subjcctincj two to post-treatnents such as deashing, subsequently treating the resulting slurry of the polyolefins in a hydrocarbon with a centrifugal separator to separate the slurry into a hydrocarbon phase containing a acetat polymers and a polyolefin cake containing a small amount of the hydrocarbon medium,and then drying the cake. the polyolefin cake containing a hydrocarbon medium has usually been dried in two steps in the first step,. it is dried with a heated nitrogen gas which contains hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and/or alcohols having i to 8 carbon atoms and has a dew point of 500c, using a drier such as a flush dryer, fluid bed dryer or rotary dryer until the concentration of the hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and/or the alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms reaches 1 to 2 % by weight, and in the second step,.it is dried using the same dryer as in the first step until the concentration of the hydrocarbons and/or alcohols reaches 100 to 2,000 ppm by weight. however, according to the known drying method the polyolefin powder still contains about 100 to 2,000 ppm by weight of hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and/or alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms owing to the hydrocarbon medium and other agents which are used in the polyra2riza- tion step and the subsequent treatments, and it is difficult to satisfactorily remove the remaining hydrocarbons and alcohols. moreover, even to reduce the hydrocarbons to such a level, the nitrogen gas should have a dew point of less than -10 c in the light of the vapor-solid adsorption equilibrium of the hydrocarbons and/or alcohols in the polyolefin phase and the nitrogen gas phase. besides, since a large amount of nitrogen gas should be used, it is necessary to re-use the gas repeatedly by circulating it in the system to save costs and, therefore, the nitrogen gas should be kept at the desired dew point by cooling and heating alternately with a freezer and a heater respectively, which results in a substantial loss of heat. the hydrocarbons and/or alcohols rema.ininc; in the polyolefin poweder are not reduced in the; subsequent pelletizing step, and te pellets thus obtained still contain almost the same amount of hydrocarbons and/or alcohols, so that when the polyolefin powders containing hydrocarbons and/or alcohols
