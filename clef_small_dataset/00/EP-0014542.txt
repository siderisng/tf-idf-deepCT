<ABSTRACT>
the tyre including at least one carcass (2) disposed in the  radial direction or the semi-radial direction, a tread portion (4),  and a breaker (9) composed of multiple-layers of belts  (5,6,7,8,8′) each composed of steel cords, which is formed  between the carcass and the tread portion.  the steel cord (a)  constituting the outermost layer belt (8′) of the breaker (9) is  arranged at between 70° to 110°, and preferably at substan­ tially right angles, to the equatorial direction of the tyre.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "tyres for trucks and buses" this invention relates to an improvement in the structure of a tyre for trucks and buses which is adapted for use on bad roads, and particularly to an improvement in the structure of a breaker composed of multiple layers of steel cord belts, various improvements have been made in truck and bus tyres for use on bad roads and resulted in a considerable upgrading in quality, for example, durability. but these improvements are still not entirely satisfactory to the users. in particular, tyres used as drive wheels of trucks and buses tend to undergo cutting at their tread surfaces. when cutting results, delamination occurs at the cut portions between the rubber and the steel cords of belts constituting the breaker or between the rubber portions near the steel cords. the delamination grows in the equatorial direction of the tyre, and finally, the tread portion is torn off from the tze in masses. a tyre of this kind for use on bad roads, which now gains videspread use, is of the structure shown in figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, in which at least one carcass ply 2 is arranged in the radial direction or semi-radial direction with its terminal portions folded back along bead cores 1. a bead portion a is reinforced with bead reinforcing members 3, and a crown portion b, having a tread 4 formed on its outer peripheral surface, includes a breaker 9 composed of, for example, four laminated layers of belts 5, 6, 7 and 8, made of steel cords a, in the circumferential direction. generally, there have previously been employed teo structures of the breaker 9 of a tyre of this kind, as shown in tables 1 and 2. table 1 emi3.1 <tb> sequence <sep> of <sep> angle <sep> of <sep> inclina- <sep> direction <sep> remarks <tb> layers <sep> from <sep> tion <sep> of <sep> cords <sep> to <sep> of <sep> the <tb> the <sep> carcass <sep> the <sep> equatorial <sep> angle <tb> ply <sep> direction <tb> 1st <sep> layer <sep> (5) <sep> 50 <sep> - <sep> 800 <sep> rising <sep> optionally <tb> <sep> rightward <sep> divided <sep> into <tb> <sep> two <sep> at <sep> the <tb> <sep> center <tb> <sep> 2nd <sep> laer <sep> (6) <sep> 10 <sep> 300 <sep> rising <tb> <sep> rightwarcl <tb> <sep> 3rd <sep> layer <sep> (7) <sep> 1 <sep> 300 <sep> rising <tb> <sep> 10 <tb> <sep> leftward <tb> <sep> 4th <sep> layer <sep> (8) <sep> 10 <sep> - <sep> 300 <sep> rising <sep> optionally <tb> <sep> leftward <sep> not <sep> used <tb> note: as regards the direction of the angle, if the 2nd layer and the 3rd layer cross each other, the directions of the 1st layer and the 4th layer are optional. table 2 emi4.1 <tb> sequence <sep> of <sep> angle <sep> of <sep> inclina- <sep> direction <sep> remarks <tb> layers <sep> from <sep> tion <sep> of <sep> cords <sep> to <sep> of <sep> the <tb> the <sep> carcass <sep> i

<CLAIMS>
   claims:         1)    a tyre for trucks and buses comprising at least one carcass (2) disposed in the radial direction or the semi-radial direction, a tread portion   (4),ormed    between said carcass and said tread portion, a breaker (9) composed  of multiple-layers of belts   (5,6,7,8,8')    each composed of steel cords, characterised in that the angle of the steel cords (a) constituting the outermost layer belt (8') of said breaker (9) to the equatorial direction (s) of the tyre is in the range of 70  to 110 .   2) a tyre as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said steel cords (a) constituting said outermost layer belt (8') are arranged at right angles or at substantially right angles to the equatorial direction of the tyre.
