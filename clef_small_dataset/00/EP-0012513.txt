<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to thermoplastic films  such as polypropylene and more particularly to biaxially  oriented polypropylene which are characterized by having  excellent anti-static properties and good resistance to the  transmission of oxygen and moisture vapor.  these proÂ­ perties are achieved by the application of a thin primer  layer containing poly (ethylenimine) to the film followed  by the application of an aqueous dispersion of a vinylidene  chloride polymer containing an anti-static additive such as  a low molecular weight glycol or a poly (ethylene oxide]  adduct of a nonpolar molecule.

<DESCRIPTION>
background of the. invention field of the invention the present invention relates to the employment of multipolymers comprising vinylidene chloride based polymers as coatings for thermoplastic packaging films. such coatings contain incorporated therein minor amounts of a novel anti- static additive material employed to reduce the tendency of such film materials to accumulate electrostatic charges and thus attract and hold particulate materials. the anti-static characteristics of the coating additionally reduce the film's undesirable tendency to cling or adhere to the surfaces of automatic packaging equipment. brief description of the prior art the employment of multipolymers cf vinylidene chloride, hereinafter referred to as saran, as coatings for oriented polypropylene materials has been recognized in the prior art as an effective means for increasing the resistance of such film materials to the transmission of gases and vapors, such as oxygen and moisture vapor for example. additionally, such saran topcoating materials have been known to promote the heat sealability of such oriented film structures which, in an uncoated state, tend to seal only with great difficulty, if at all. sarah coated oriented polypropylene is a particularly good packaging material for products which tend to be sensitive to attack by oxygen such as, fo example, coffee and cheese. however, such saran coated plgste materials have a tendency to develop a static charge whet sed on packaging equipment. this has been an obstacle particularly when packaging ground coffee and other particulate products in that the static charge developed on the film tends to attract the product to the seal area thus preventing the packaging film from effectively sealing to itself in a continuous manner. in the past such coated packaging film has been produced by subjecting the surface of an oriented film to a corona discharge treatment to pretreat the surface in order to improve its receptivity, i.e., bonding characteristics, to coatings which may be subsequently applied thereto. other surface pretreatment techniques which may be employed include flame treatment or treatment of the film surface with oxidizing chemicals such as chromic acid for example. the thus treated oriented polypropylene may then be coated with a thin layer of a primer material which serves to enhance the adherence of the saran topcoat layer, subsequently supplied tithe base film. primers which have been used in the past include polyurethane dissolved in organic solvents, see for example u.s. patent no. 3,023,125. alternatively, the sarah coating may, in certain instances, be applied directly on the treated film surface without the employment of a special primer coating. a wide variety of saran topcoat materials are currently commercially available. any one of these sarans may be employed in the practice of the present invention and preferably those which have a vinylidene chloride content of about 75% by weight up to about 92s by weight. any one of a number of well known coating additives may also be incorporated in the saran topcoat material. ad juvants such as carnauba wax, employed to promote cold slip and reduce blocking tendencies; additionally materials such
