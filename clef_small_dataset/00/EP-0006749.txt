<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for measuring a gas comprises a tube (16)  along which a beam (22) of radiation proceeds from a  source (20) to a detector (24).  the tube (16), which might  be disposed transverse a chimney stack, has lower and  upper apertures (26a, 26b), through which the gas can  enter the tube and leave it.  each aperture can be opened  and closed either by a rotatable apertured inner tube (18)  or by respective doors (18a, 18b) or sets of doors (118a to  119b).  the apparatus permits standardisation of measureÂ­ ment according to beer's law either at a single frequency  or using two frequencies of radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method and apparatus for measuring gas, including standardisation" this invention relates to an apparatus and a method for measuring a quantity of gas and in particular to an improved technique of standardisation. the invention is particularly though not exclusively intended for the measurement of exhaust gases produced by combustion. apparatus for measuring gases, particularly the products of combustion, are known, from for example united states patent specification no. 4076425. gas measuring apparatus often operates in harsh environments and in inaccessible locations. they are particularly subject to aging or drift in components and the accumulation of dirt and to operate effectively they ought to incorporate their own means of standardisation or calibration. it has been proposed, in united states patent specification no. 3836237 to use air curtains to keep a viewing window clean and it is known to correct aging of lamps and drift in electronic circuits, as proposed in united states patent specificationsnos. 3838925 and 4076425. nevertheless, standardisation or calibration is not satisfactorily obtained by those proposals. one object of the present invention is to facilitate the improved measurement of gases and a subsidiary object of the invention is the provision of apparatus which can be more effectively calibrated than hitherto. preferred embodiments of the invention include a source which emits a beam of radiation which impinges on a detector. the beam is enclosed by a housing which has apertures that permit gas to enter the housing, intercept the beam ad to leave the housing, means are provided for closing the apertures and for purging the gas fram the housing. in one embodiment of the invention the beam passes along the two tubes which are relatively movable to bring respective apertures into register. in other embodiments of the invention a tube along which the radiation passes is provided with openable doors. it will be explained hereinafter how such an apparatus may be used to perform the method of measuring according to the present invention. in the accompanying drawings: figure 1 is a side view of one embodiment of gas measuring apparatus according to the present invention; figures 2a and 2b are cross-sectional views of the apparatus of figure 1 taken along the plane 2-2; figure 3 is a pictorial representation of the use of apparatus according to the invention to monitor exhaust gases; figure 4 is a graph of the absorption spectrum of a typical gas as a function of frequency; figure 5 is a side view of another embodiment of apparatus according to the invention; figures 6a and 6b are cross-sectional views taken along the plane 6-6 in figure 5; figure 7 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a variant of the apparatus shown in figure 5 and figure 8 is a perspective view illustrating another variant of the embodiment of figure 5. in figure 1 is shown one embodiment of a gas measuring apparatus. the apparatus 10 comprises a first enclosure 12, a second enclosure 14 and a hollow tube 16 which extends between and connects the two enclosures
