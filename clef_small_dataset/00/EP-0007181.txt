<ABSTRACT>
an improved plastic bag is disclosed in which integral  handle portions extending upwardly adjacent the mouth of  the bag are provided with reinforcement strips extending  laterally across the handles, the lower boundary of the rein­ forcing strips having an undulating configuration which pro­ vides an extended length edge for the joint between the strip  and the underlying bag material, thereby improving the over­ all strength of the bag and handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field the present invention relates to a type of plastic bag having reinforced handle portions. background art the invention is an improvement upon that disclosed in applicant's u. s. patent no, 4,125,220. the bag disclosed in this patent includes integral handle portions which extend upwardly on either side of the mouth of the bag and are configured in a symmetrical waveform about the center line of the bag. strips of reinforcing material extend across and are secured to the handle portions of the bags disclosed in this patent, the strips as disclosed having an essentially straight lower boundary edge which does not extend to the side seams of the bag. while the bags disclosed in applicant's patent have achieved a great measure of success in the marketplace, experience with them has shown that they sometimes will fail along the lower boundary edge of the reinforcing strips of the handle portions, particularly when the bag is required to carry loads approaching its design limitations. thus, a need has been identified for a means to prevent or minimize this tendency of the bags to fail at this location. a principle object of the invention is to provide an improved bag structure having reinforced handle portions which greatly reduce or eliminate any tendency of the bag to fail along the boundary edges of the handle reinforcing strips. another object of the invention is to provide such an improved bag structure which can be made following the simplified techniques disclosed in applicant's u. s. patent. these objects are provided only as examples; thus, those skilled in the art may perceive other desirable objectives and advantages inherently achieved by the disclosed bag structure. nonetheless, the scope of the invention is to be limited only by the appended claims. disclosure of invention the above objects and other advantages are achieved by the various embodiments of the present invention in which a pair of opposing bag walls of plastic film material are provided, joined to each other to form a bottom edge, a pair of side edges and an open mouth. integral handle portions extend from the bag walls on either side of the mouth and are provided with reinforcing strips extending across the handle portions, the lower boundary edges of the reinforcing strips having an undulating configurdtion, the undulating confiruation produces an extended length for the edge or joint between the strips and the underlying bag walls, which results in improved overall strength of the bag and a substantially reduced tendency to fail along the lower boundary edge. brief description of drawings figure 1 shows a plastic bag of the type disclosed and claimed in applicant's u. s. patent no. 4,125,220, figure 2 shows one embodiment of the present invention in which the reinforcing strips extend from one side edge to the other. figure 3 shows another embodiment of the invention in which the reinforcing strips have a single symmetrical undulation on their lower boundary edges, the strips extending only to locations between the bag

claims    1. a plastic bag, comprising:  a pair of opposing bag walls of plastic film material joined to each other to form a bottom edge, a pair of side edges and an open mouth for the bag;  a pair of handle portions, one extending upwardly from each of said walls on either side of said mouth;  a pair of strips of material, one extending laterally at least across each of said handle portions, each of said strips being secured to its handle portion and including a lower boundary edge having an undulating configuration,  2. a plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein each of said handle portions comprises an integral portion of its associated bag wall and is shaped in a wave configuration symmetrical about a center line disposed substantially equidistant between said side edges of said bag with the lowest points of said wave configuration being located adjacent said side edges and the highest portion of said wave configuration being located substantially on said center line.    3. a plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein each of said strips extends only to locations on said bag walls between said side edges.     4. a plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein the width of each of said strips is less than the height of said handle portions, thereby defining an upper boundary edge for said strips, said upper boundary edge also having an undulating configuration.    5. a plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein said undulating configuration is sinusoidal.    6. a plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein each of said handle portions includes an opening extending therethrough, said opening being located at least partially within said strip of said handle portion.    7.   a    plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein each of said pair of strips extends from one side edge to the other.      8.   a    plastic bag according to claim 1, wherein said strips of material are adhesively secured to said handle portions.
