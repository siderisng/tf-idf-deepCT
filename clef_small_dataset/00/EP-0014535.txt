<ABSTRACT>
a control arrangement is provided for a heating system  having heat outlets each controlled by a solenoid valve (210).   each heat outlet is connected to a pair of thermostatic  switches (411,413) operative at different temperatures.  a time  switch included in a central control means (108) is operative to  selectively energise a pair of bus-bars (530, 532) at different  times, thereby to provide common output signals for actuat­ ing the heat outlets via different thermostatic switches (411,  413) at different times to provide different heat outputs during  different parts of a predetermined period of time (e. g.  24  hours).  the central control means (108) includes a plurality of  manual switches (540) each connecting the time switch out­ put bus-bars (530, 532) to the thermostatic switches (411, 413)  of an associated one of the heat outlets to manually set the  heat output of the heat outlet.  the time switch and each  manual switch (540) cooperate in such a manner that each  overrides the other as appropriate to keep the area heated by  each outlet at an appropriate temperature.
