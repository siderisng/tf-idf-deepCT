<ABSTRACT>
an enzymatically active product for use in isomeriza­ tion of glucose into fructose is provided.  the active pro­ duct comprises an organic polymeric material predomi­ nantly comprised of a monovinyl aromatic compound  polymer having β-aminopropionamidomethyl group as  side chains represented by the formula i:    wherein r₁ is selected from h, c(1-6) alkyl and c(2-6)  hydroxyalkyl, r₂ is selected from c(1-6) alkyl, c(2-6)  hydroxyalkyl,    (where x, z₁ and z₂ are selected from h and c(1-6) alkyl,  and n is from 2 to 6), or r₁ and r₂ form together with the  n atom, to which r₁ and r₂ are bonded, a heterocylic  structure of the formula:    where a is -ch₂-, -o- or -nr₆- (wherein r₆ is h or c(1-6)  alkyl), and r₃, r₄ and r₅ are selected from h and methyl.   the organic polymeric material has glucose isomerase  immobilized with the β-aminopropionamidomethyl group  side chain of the organic polymeric material.
