<ABSTRACT>
1.  a sliding vane pump, particularly a vacuum pump for increasing the braking power in motor vehicles, the rotor of which is mounted in a pump housing (1) on a hollow shaft (5) comprising a lubricant supply means, and is provided with vane foot chambers (10) which are connected to the hollow shaft (5) for receiving the stream of lubricant and which are provided at their one axial end with passages (7. 2) to lead the stream of lubricant onto the circumference of the hollow shaft (5) and into the sliding bearing (7) disposed on said axial end between the outer circumference of the hollow shaft (5) and the housing (1), with the sliding vane pump comprising a discharge channel (13) which runs within the pump housing (1) and opens into the oil reservoir (14), characterized by the fact that the rotor mounted on the hollow shaft (5) is supported in cantilever fashion in two sliding bearings (6, 7) which are arranged at an axial distance with respect to each other, in the pump housing, that an annular channel (8) is enclosed between the two sliding bearings (6, 7), the hollow shaft (5) and the pump housing (1), which annular channel (8) comprises a discharge leading to the oil reservoir (14), and that either the discharge channel (13) of the pump opens into the annular channel (8) behind the second sliding bearing (7) adjacent the rotor, or that the discharge channel (13. 1) of the pump opens into an annular chamber (12) in front of the second sliding bearing (7), which annular chamber (12) connects the vane foot chambers (10) to one another.
