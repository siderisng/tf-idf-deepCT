<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a blend of from 2 to 60% by weight  of i a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and styrene, and from  98 to 40% by weight of   ii a copolymer prepared by the polymerization of 100  parts by weight of   (a) more than 50%  by weight of at least one olefinically unsa­ turated nitrile and   (b) less than 50% by weight, based on the combined weights  of (a) plus (b), of a monomer component copolymerisable  with the olefinically unsaturated nitrile, in the presence of  from 0 to 40 parts by weight of   (c) a rubbery polymer of a conjugated diene monomer and  optionally at least one comonomer which is a vinyl aromat­ ic monomer, an olefinically unsaturated nitrile or an ester  of the formula    in which   r₁ represents hydrogen, an alkyl group having from 1 to 4  carbon atoms or a halogen, and r₂ is an alkyl group having  from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, which rubbery polymer contains  from 50 to 100% by weight of polymerised conjugated diene  and from 0 to 50% by weight of comonomer.  the blends according to the invention have improved op­ tical mechanical and gas barrier properties, and substantially  improved processibility.
