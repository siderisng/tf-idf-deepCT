<ABSTRACT>
Electromagnetic actuator in which the actuating element (11) clamped on one side is held against a bias voltage on a magnetic core (10) by a magnetic flux whose flux density is cyclically changeable over time.The actuating element (11) can be selectively triggered that a compensation coil (13) is energized only when the magnetic flow attracting the actuation element (11) has its low, for holding sufficient value.The source of the magnetic flux is a permanent magnet (12) which is moved or rotated for cycling change of the actuating element (11) attaching force with respect to a pole pair (16, 16) of the magnetic arm (10), back and forth, whereby the magnetic resistance between the permanentma gnet (12) and the magnetic core (10) of the electromagnetic actuating device changes cyclically.
