<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a continuous, steady state process for  the preparation of nonrandom ethylene/α,β-ethylenically  unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymers in at least 2 constant  environment, stirred autoclaves in series wherein the first  autoclave is maintained at the pressure in the range of 800 to  3000 atmospheres (11. 8 to 44. 1 kpsi) and at a temperature in  the range of 120° to 200°c in a single phase reaction mixture  at the given concentration of copolymer in the reaction  mixture and at the given acid comonomer content of the  copolymer and wherein each succeeding autoclave is main­ tained at a temperature of at least 30°c in excess of the  preceding autoclave.  the copolymers thus obtained have a  ratio of percent adjacent acid to weight percent acid in the  copolymer of from above 0. 44 to about 1. 0.  these copolym­ ers have improved stiffness and are particularly useful in  sheeting, blow molding, and packaging applications and for  conversion to ionomers which are also useful for similar  applications.
