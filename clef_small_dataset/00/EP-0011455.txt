<ABSTRACT>
a lubricant composition (a) to improve the melt strength  and processability, e. g.  extrudability, of a polymer formed  from at least one ethylenically unsaturated compound, the  composition (a) comprising (1) a heat stabilizer known to be  capable of heat stabilizing the said polymer; (2) an external  lubricant for the said polymer, and (3) an oxidized polymer,  wherein at least 50% of the repeating units of the oxidized  polymer are derived from ethylene and any remaining units  thereof are derived from at least one α-olefin containing  from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, and the oxidized polymer exhibits  an acid number greater than 5 and a melt viscosity of from  1,000 to about 60,000 centipoises at a temperature of 140°c.  there is also provided a polymer composition (b) com­ prising a halogen-containing polymer as a major component  together with the said lubricant composition (a).
