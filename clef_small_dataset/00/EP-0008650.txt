<ABSTRACT>
Device for fixing from powdered toner images applied to an enchantment carrier with the aid of solvent vapor. For fixing on a recording medium, z. b. A paper web, applied toner powder with electrostatic copying or printing equipment, the recording carrier is transported by a fixing station in which the toner is firmly connected to the recording medium. The fixing station includes a container (BH) by which the drawing carrier (at) loop-shaped. Solvent steam is generated at the bottom of the container. In the solvent beam enriched area of ​​the container (fixing area US), a deflection of direction (UE) is arranged around which the recording medium is guided around. In this case, the concrete side of the drawing carrier is exposed to the solvent steam. The recording medium releases the fixture rich (US) after fixation and is released from the container (BH) via a deflection roller (UR). The fixing area (US) is limited by the fact that cooling loaks (KL) are arranged in the upper region of the container in the container wall. This creates a cooled region in the container, in which the solvent emerging from the fixing region (US) condenses steam. To insert the recording medium (at), the deflection device UE can be removed from the container (BH).
