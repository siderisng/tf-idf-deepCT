<ABSTRACT>
Electrolysis apparatus in alkaline medium compror so much at least set of cells (1) housed in an enthusiast of annular frames (2) of spacement including annular pods (21,22) mark joint planes Deuncarding outwards and each equipped with electrode plates (7) and a diaphragm (8) which form composition (9) and (10) each containing an electrolyte under pressure provided by at least one channel D The arrival, the gas formed by electrolysis being evacuated to channels, and it is essentially characterized by the fact that each seal plan opening outward is associated with at least one collecting annular groove (21 ¹) it spared in A frame range and associated with evacuation means (27) capable of evacuating the electrolyte flowing through said seal plan. The apparatus according to the invention is a bipolar electrode unit recalling the structure of a filter-press.
