<ABSTRACT>
a nuclear reactor system wherein a prestressed con足 crete reactor vessel (23) is provided with a main cavity for  the reactor core and at least one subsidiary cavity (21) for  a steam generator.  at least two feedwater penetrations (48)  are provided in the reactor vessel communicating between  the exterior of the reactor vessel and the subsidiary cylin足 drical cavity.  a superheater penetration (52) is provided  aligned with the axis of the cavity with the feedwater pene足 trations and the superheater penetration having mutually  parallel axes.  superheater outlet means (55) are positioned  in the superheater penetration and include a tubesheet  (113) positioned a substantial distance from both the sub足 sidiary cylindrical cavity and the exterior of the reactor  vessel.
