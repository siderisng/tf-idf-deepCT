<ABSTRACT>
in an optical fibre cable comprising an assembly of  transmission units, either all optical fibre waveguide units or  including electrical conductor modules, at least three transmission  units of circular cross-section and of equal external  diameter, at least one of which is an optical fibre waveguide  unit (15), are helically laid around a central reinforcing  member (17), with or without intervening units, preferably  conductor modules (16), which may be of smaller diameter,  and possibly with one or more outer helically laid layers of  conductor modules, the whole assembly being contained in  a closely fitting tubular jacket (18), which may have reinforcing  members embedded therein.  each optical fibre unit  consists of a plastic sheath having a circular cylindrical  external surface, with one or more bores containing loose  optical fibres, and compression resistant reinforcing members  embedded in the sheath.  each electrical conductor  module may consist of any desired number of wires, with or  without a containing sheath.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to optical-fibre cables of the type incorporating a plurality of longitudinal transmission units, which may all be optical fibre waveguide units or may include electrical conductors in addition to one or more optical fibre wave guide units. it has been proposed to employ, in the construction of an optical fibre cable, one or more optical fibre units consisting of a tubular sheath of plastics material with one or more optical fibre waveguides disposed in the tube bore, the units or a unit, with or without one or more electrical conductors, being assembled together in either a straight or an intertwisted arrangement within an outer jacket. however, optical fibre cables of this construction are subject to the disadvantage that the sheaths of the individual fibre units have a tendency to shrink longitudinally due to relaxation, this shrinkage resulting in the formation of undulations, kinks or bends in the optical fibres, which cause undesirably high optical losses to occur in the fibres in operation of the cable. it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical fibre cable incorporating one or more optical fibre units, which units are of an improved form whereby the tendency for shrinkage of the sheaths to occur can be eliminated. according to the invention, in an optical fibre cable consisting of an assembly of longitudinal transmission units, including one or more optical fibre waveguide units of circular cross-section, helically twisted in one or more layers around a central elongate reinforcing member disposed along the axis of the cable, and a cylindrical tubular jacket closely fitting around said assembly, the said assembly includes or consists of at least three said transmission units which are of circular cross-section with equal external diameter and are helically laid directly upon said central reinforcing member, and at least one of which is an optical fibre waveguide unit, and each optical fibre waveguide unit in said assembly consists of a sheath of synthetic plastic material having one or more tubular bores therethrough and having a circular cylindrical external surface, one or more optical fibre waveguides disposed loosely in at least one of said bores and lying generally para ilel to the unit axis, and, embedded in the sheath wall surrounding said one or more bores, one or more continuous elongate compression resistant reinforcing members disposed substantially parallel to the optical fibre waveguide or waveguides. the term "loosely", as used herein with reference to the disposition-of the optical fibre or fibres in the bore or bores of the unit sheath, is to be understood to mean that the bore, or each bore, is of sufficiently large cross-section to permit freedom of movement of the fibre, or of each individual fibre, within it in both radial and axial directions. such freedom of movement of optical fibre wave guides within a containing sheath is advantageous in that it reduces optical losses in the waveguides in operation. the reinforcing members embedded in the optical fibre unit sheath may be composed of
