<ABSTRACT>
Mixtures are claimed, which essentially consist of a graft mixing polymer (A) and (b) and a hard component (6), the last RE is constructed of copolymers of styrene and / or α-methyl styrene with acrylonitrile. The graft mixing polyly merisates (a) and (b) are respectively constructed on the basis of a crosslinked acrylic ester rubber and contained on this basis grafted a mixture of styrene and acrylic nitrile as a graft shell or graft price. They differ only slightly in the chemical composition, but clearly in the particle size of the acrylic ester foundation used for the grafting. The weight ratio of the graft basics, based on the total mix, may be in the range of 90: 10 to 35 to 65, and the proportion of the sum of the two graft basics, based on the total mix, should be about 10 to 35% by weight. Mixtures from the above-mentioned 3 components are weather-resistant and have a high impact resistance with at the same time good memory. the use of such mixtures according to the usual methods for thermoplastic processing, such. b. Extrusion or injection molding, especially after the previous coloring, in the area of ​​the casting body or the binding seam practically no different color tinting, so that the most diverse shape body can be used for daily needs or for the recreational stalment.
