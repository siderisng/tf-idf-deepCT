<ABSTRACT>
in lithographic inks containing colorant, binder resin and  reactive diluent, the diluent comprises oxidatively curable  ester prepared by reaction of drying oil fatty acid with  hydroxyl-containing, addition polymerizable compounds,  such as reaction product of polyol with addition polymerizÂ­ able acid, hydroxyalkyl ester of such acid, hydroxyalkyl vinyl  sulfide or hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether.  the curable ester may also  be prepared by reaction of addition polymerizable acid with  hydroxyl-containing reaction product of polyol with drying oil  fatty acid.  transesterifiable esters can be used instead of the  acids.  preferred drying oil acids are derived from tung oil,  linseed oil, safflower oil, soybean oil or dehydrated castor oil.   the curable ester preferably comprises acryloxy alkyl or  methacryloxy alkyl drying oil fatty acid ester.
