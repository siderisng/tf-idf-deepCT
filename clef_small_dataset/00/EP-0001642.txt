<ABSTRACT>
a novel cracking catalyst, a method of preparing same  and an improved hydrocarbon cracking process are provided  wherein adverse effects of metals such as nickel, vanadium,  iron, copper and cobalt in the cracking catalyst are precluded  or mitigated by contacting the cracking catalyst with (a) at  least one of elemental antimony and compounds thereof  whereby there is added to said catalyst a modifying amount of  each of (a) and (b) with the weight ratio of antimony to tin  being such as to provide passivation of the contaminating  metals greater than the sum of the passivation effects of each  of (a) and (b) individually.  in general the ratio will be in the  range of from 0. 001:1 to 1000:1, and preferably will be in the  range of 0. 05:1 to 50:1.
