<ABSTRACT>
process and apparatus for a hydrocarbon conversion  process, for example thermal cracking, in which feedstock  is converted in a heated furnace, the furnace being heated  by burning a mixture of fuel and preheated air.  the preheat­ ed air is obtained by passing air through successive com­ pression, heating and gas turbine expansion zones, the  work thereby obtained from the gas turbine expansion zone  being used, at least in part, to compress hydrocarbon pro­ cess gas produced in the furnace.
