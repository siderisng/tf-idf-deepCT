<ABSTRACT>
the mouldings are produced by intimate mixing of one or more monomers, at least some of which contain a furan ring, with an acid curing agent and one or more waste products which are non-usable end products of chemical or industrial processes or weathering products, and, if desired, finely divided aluminium, magnesium, heavy metal or glass as blowing agent constituent.  the mouldings can be produced in foamed form either by using an excess of the monomers, at least some of which contain a furan ring, compared with the acid curing agent or by adding finely divided aluminium, magnesium or heavy metal or glass before the curing.  the mouldings can be used as an insulation material, disposal agent or protective encasing for hazardous waste or as building materials.
