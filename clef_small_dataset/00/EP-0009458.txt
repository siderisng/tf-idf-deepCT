<ABSTRACT>
1.  temperature exchanger device, comprising means for the circulation of a fluid and at least one thermal exchange wall (1) in thermal contact with the means, said wall comprising a first plate (6) provided with slits (6a) spaced regularly one from another and small blades (6b) intercalated regularly between the slits and raised from the general plane of the plate, and a second plate (4) arranged in the same manner as the first, both plates being assembled in relation to each other in such a way that the solid parts (4d, 6c) of the one are placed in front of the slits (4a, 6a) of the other, characterized in that : - the means of circulation of the fluid consists of a piping system (2) non-integral with the two plates (4, 6) where each plate has an edge (4c, 6d) resting against one side of the piping system ; - the width of the solid parts (4d, 6c) separating two consecutive slits (4a, 6a) and the width of the slits are equal, on the one hand for each plate and on the other hand between the two plates (4, 6) ; - the small blades (6b) of one of the plates (6) are engaged in the slits (4a) of the other plate (4) in the same direction as are the small blades (4b) of the other plate (4) ; - the two plates (4, 6) are arranged one against the other, in such a way that the solid parts (4d, 6c) of the one completely shut off the slits (4a, 6a) of the other.
