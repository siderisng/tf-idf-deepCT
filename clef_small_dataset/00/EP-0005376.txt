<ABSTRACT>
a method for making decorative emblems, plaques,  and panels comprising flow coating a clear, fluent plastics  material onto the surface of a decorated substrate (12).   flow coating is accomplished with a multiple orifice  nozzle (49) (or nozzles 49, 50) which is passed over the  surface of the decorative substrate at a steady speed to  give a uniform thickness coating of . 020 to . 030 inch  (. 508 to . 762 mm).  the flow coated fluent plastic is then  cured and the emblems, plaques or panels are formed from  the coated decorative substrate.

tietiiod for naming decoriztive emblems cross-refcrence to related applications cross-refercnce is hereby made to related applications serial no. 718,578, filed august 30, 1976, and serial no. 702,194, filed july 2, 1976, as a continuation-in-part of serial no. 478,789, filed june 12, 1974. background of the invention the present invention relates to a method for making decorative emblems, plaques, panels, etc., which have a cured plastic layer over a decorative surface and, more particularly, it relates to a method for flow coating a fluent plastic material onto a decorative substrate to give a uniform thickness coated substrate from which emblems, plaques, or panels are formed. decorative plaques and emblems are widely used throughout a number of industries, including the automotive and appliance fields. in the past, a colored vitreous frit was flowed into a bronze substrate and fired at12500f. the glass-like vitreous enamel served to beautify the product and protect the decorative substrate from weathering should the plaque or emblem be exposed to the environment. today, plastics are primarily used for producing such plaques and emblems. for example, in loew (u. s. patent no. 3,654,og2), there is disclosed a process for injection molding a decorative ilylar facing sheet over a vinyl plastic body. the plaque is coated with a layer of protective varnish on the outer surface of the facincj sheet. gits, u. s. patent no. 3,246,066, is similar in that male and female molds are used to form a cavity into which a decorative foil is placed and into which a clear plastic material is injected. prior to injecting a clear plastic material against the front face of the foil, the foil is precoated. other molding processes, such as compression molding (either one or two shot), are also well known in the art. see for instance, u.s. patents no. 2,244, 565;2,931,119; 3,075,249; and 3,114,597. in my copending application serial no. 702,194, filed july 2, 1976, there is disclosed an improved process for producing decorative emblems. that process involves casting a plastic material onto decorative foil shapes to form a meniscus which when cured gives a lens effect to the top surface of the foil shape. a problem with that process is that despite an ability to vary the size and shape, it is not practical to later conform the as-cast emblem to non-planar surfaces. another problem is that the foil shapes are cast individually and the manufacturing process can as a result be too cumbersome and costly for some purposes. accordingly, the need exists for yet another improved process for producing decorative emblems which is less expensive, more efficient and which yields a product which can be fond to different three-dimensional shapes if desired. the present invention meets tat need by utilizing a flow coating process to apply a clear plastic material to a decorative substrate from which individual emblems and plaques may then be stamped and shaped. of course, flow coating per se is known in a number of areas. my copending application serial no. 718,578, filed august 30,

 claims   1. a method for producing decorative emblems, plaques and panels, comprising:  (a) providing a substrate (12) having a top surface and a bottom surface and a decorative design or series of designs (82) applied to its top surface,  said substrate having sharply defined peripheral sides which intersect with said top surface,  (b) holding said substrate flat and horizontal on a   support    surface free from surrounding side walls,  (c)   flow    coating a clear viscous fluent plastic onto said top surface of said substrate from multiple orifices (62) so that said fluent plastic flows to said sharply defined peripheral sides without flowing over said sharply defined peripheral sides,  and forms a uniform   coating    approximately .020 to   .070    inch   (.50k3    to   .762      r.m)    thick,  (d)   allowing    said fluent plastic to cure while maintaining said substrate flat and horizontal, and  (e) trimming, cutting and forming said substrate having said   cured    plastic (84) thereon to produce the desired emblem   plaque    or panel configuration.   2. the   m@thod   of claim 1 wherein said substrate (12) is   approximat@ly    0.003 to 0.020 inch (0,0762 to 508 mm) thick metal foil.        5.    the method of   claim    2 wherein said metal foil is primed prior to   bering    decorated and coated with said fluent plastic.   4. the   method    of claim 3 wherein said fluent plastic is cured by heating under infrared   lamps (23).      5. the method of claim 4 wherein said substrate is held flat and horizontal on a vacuum mat (45) which also serves as a heat sink during the heat curing of said fluent plastic.   6. the method of claim 3 wherein said metal foil substrate is silk-screen printed and embossed to form a series of designs thereon.   7. the method of claim 6 wherein a number of individual emblems or plaques are formed from said coated substrate by stamping out said emblem or plaque contiguous with each individual design of said series of designs.   8. the method of claim 7 wherein said emblem or plaque is stamped out by application of a cutting die to said bottom surface of said substrate so that each emblem or   plaque    has a convex shape when viewed  from said top surface.     9. the method of claim 1 wherein several sets of nozzles (49, 50)   each    having multiple orifices (61,   62)    are passed in a single pass at a steady speed over the top surface   o;    said   substrate    (12)   while    said substrate is held stationary.   10. the method of   claim    1 wherein a   single    nozzle   having    multiple   orifices    is passed at a   steady    speed back and forth in several passes over the top surface of said substrate   while    said substrate is held stationary.   11. a method for producing a number of decorative emblems   from    a single sheet of aluminium foil, comprising:    (a)      providing      an      approximately      0.00    to 0.020 inch (0.0762 to 508 mm) inch thick aluminium foil (12) having a top surface and a bottom surface,    (b)      applying    a primer to said top surface of said aluminium foil prior to   ser@@n    printing,  (c)   silk-screen    printing and embossing said face to form a series of individual decorative emblem shapes   (82) thereo@,    said foil having sharply defined peripheral sides which intersect with said top surface,  (d) allowing the decorations to set prior to      placin@      tiic      bottom    side of   said      aluminium    foil on top of a vacuum mat (45) on a horizontal vacuum table (35),    (@)    applying a vacuum   dmaw    to   said    bottom surface of said aluminium foil   through      t      vacuum      mat      (45j    to hold said aluminium foil flat and horizontal,  (f) flow coating a clear viscous polyurethane in liquid   form    onto said top   surface    of said aluminium foil by passing multiple orifices (61,  62) over said top surface at a steady specd as said aluminium foil is held stationary  and   constantly    ejecting liquid polyurethane from each of said orifices   during    the passage so that said liquid   polyurethane    flows to said sharply defined   peripl0eral    sides without   flowing    over said sharply   defiled    peripheral sides and forms a uniform coating of approximately .020 to .030 inch (.508 to .762 mm) thick,  (g) heating the coated aluminium foil under infradred lamps   (25)    while said aluminium foil is maintained flat aid horizontal to cure said liquid polyurethane,  (h) cooling and removing the coated   aluminium    foil from said vacuum mat,   and  (i) stamping individual emblems from said aluminium foil by application of a cutting die contiguous with each of said emblem shapes to the bottom surface of said aluminium foil.
