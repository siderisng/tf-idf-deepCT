<ABSTRACT>
1.  a resilient mounting for a rail (r) on its support (2) comprising flexible liner means (4) interposed between the rail (r) and the support (2), and on both sides of the rail (r), securing means comprising an electric insulating restrainer (5) abutting against the edge of the rail flange (1) which it covers, and against its support (2) clamping means (7, 8) extending through said restrainer (5) and a spring plate (6) which is not in contact with the rail (r) covering the restrainer (5) and having longitudinal edges parallel to the rail (r) characterized in that the spring plate (6) overlaps the restrainer (5) at least above the rail flange (1) and comprises at least the longitudinal edge (24) facing towards the rail which, in the unclamped state, is bowed parallel to the rail (r) so that the concavity faces towards the rail flange (1), while in the clamped state, it is flattened at a small distance above the rail (r), the plate (6) being applied against the whole portion of the restrainer covering the edge of the rail flange (1).
