<ABSTRACT>
in a system wherein input digital signals having an arbit­ rary bit rate are converted into digital signals of a bit rate  higher than that of the input digital signals and then transmit­ ted through a signal format converter4; in order to realize the  signal format conversion in real time the signal format con­ verter 4 is constructed of a buffer circuit 6 of small capacity, a  circuit which writes the input signals into the butter circuit 6 at  the bit rate of said input signals and which reads out the  written signals at the bit rate of a transmission line 3, a circuit  which distinguishes the signals to be read as a mark, space  and empty, and an encoding circuit 7 which converts the  mark, space and empty into pulse signals discernible with the  unit being a time slot of the transmission line 3 or integral  times the time slot, in dependence on the levels of pulses or  the numbers of successive pulses (run length).
