<ABSTRACT>
a controller for an auxillary mechanism of an industrial  truck; a sensor head (1) detects movement of the mechanism  and provides signals denoting increments of that movement  and a counter (4) receives those signals and therby provides  a count denoting the position of the mechanism along its range  of movement.  a memory (10) is controllable to provide one of a  plurality of stored representations for comparison with the  count and means (8) compare the count with a representation  made available from the memory (10) to provide a signal for  controlling the movement of the mechanism.  a keyboard (20)  is provided for effecting storage in the memory (10) of represÂ­ entations of different positions along the mechanism's range  of movement.
