<ABSTRACT>
a bias actuator, such as an extensible link (31), in the  longitudinal cyclic pitch channel of a helicopter is provided  with inputs as a function of airspeed multiplied inversely  with collective pitch, and as a function of the rate of change  of collective pitch stick (42) position, so as to enforce positive  angle of attack and speed stability and positive static pitch  trim gradient and to decouple collective pitch from the longitudinal  cyclic pitch channel at cruise airspeeds, the invention,  inter alia, adverse control effects of tail stabilizer surfaces  at cruise speeds.  a pair of indicators (53, 55) display  bias commands and actual bias responses.
