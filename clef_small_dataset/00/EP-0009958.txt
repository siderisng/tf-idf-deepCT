<ABSTRACT>
in a combination crane comprising a hollow crane (3)  with two jib cranes (1, 2) mounted thereon, the lower end of  each jib (4, 4′) is supported on a rotatable base part (17, 17′)  arranged about the crane tower.  the lower rotatable base part  (17′) is mounted on a stationary foundation (18) whereas the  upper rotatable base part (17) is supported on the lower rotat­ able base part (17′) so as to rotate relative thereto.  a rotating  element (20) mounted at the top of the hollow crane tower (3)  and carrying supports (11, 11′) for the hoisting and luffing  ropes (10, 12) includes means for deliberately turning the  rotating element synchronously with the tandem slewing  operation of the crane jibs.  the ropes passing through the  hollow tower of the crane are wound onto rope drums includ­ ing means for displacing the drums so as to keep an unvari­ able rope path between the crane tower and the rope drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
"combination crane" the present invention relates to a combination crane comprising a crane tower with two jib cranes mounted thereon, each jib crane comprising a rotatable base part arranged about the common crane tower and carrying the lower end of the respective jib and serving for individual slewing of the jib. from swedish printed publication no. 384 196 there is known a combination crane comprising two crane jibs, each of which at their lower end is affixed to a rotatable supporting ring. between each supporting ring and the top of the crane tower there is arranged a rigid vertically extending beam, and each rigid beam carries rope winches for the lifting and luffing operation of the individual jibs. the present invention aims for a crane structure in which the rigid vertically extending beams are eliminated, and in which the wires for lifting and luffing operations are not exposed to weather along the crane tower. from gb-ps 1 334 396 there is known a crane with two jibs and further comprising a common gear ring attached to the crane tower. the individual externally mounted slewing means mounted on the individual supporting rings are in engagement with the common gear ring for slewing operation of each crane jib. this arrangement is not likely to be efficient when the two jibs are to work in tandem, since an irregular syncronization during tandem operation may result in all side forces being adopted by one jib only, the crane jibs therefore having to be designed for -a double maximum side load compared to the side load of one crane only. besides, this known arrangement suffers from the disadvantage of comprising a separate foundation for each supporting ring. fr-ps 1 577 034 discloses a double crane which does not allow passing of the various ropes through the crane mast, whereas us-ps 3 446 362 discloses a hoisting device having a single boom only. the object of the present invention is to give instructions for a combination crane having a simpler structure and offering larger operational advantages compared with previously known cranes of this type. in connection with a combination crane as mentioned in the preamble, this object is, in accordance with the invention, achieved in that the lower rotatable base part is mounted on a foundation which is stationary relative to the crane tower, and that the upper rotatable base part is supported on the lower rotatable base part so as to rotate relative thereto. in connection with such a combination of two crane jibs connected rotatably about a common stationary crane tower, the working area across which the individual crane jibs can sweep, will cover approximately 3600, provided that the individual jibs are moved so as to avoid collision. for the crane jibs there are on the top of the crane tower provided rotatable top pieces carrying rope pullies for the luffing ropes and hoisting ropes of the respective crane jibs, the rotatable top pieces being mounted on a common rotating element for rotating therewith
