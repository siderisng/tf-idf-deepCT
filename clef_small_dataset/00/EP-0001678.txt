<ABSTRACT>
wire deploying apparatus comprises a templet (26) having  a wire supporting working surface in which are formed a  plurality of justaposed, elongate wire depressing recesses,  and a wire pressing member (44) arranged to be moved in a  given direction across the wire supporting surface longitudinally  of the recesses and towards one end thereof, to press  wires (2) extending between the supporting surface and the  pressing member (44) into the recesses for correctly aligning  the wires with the recesses, a wire controller member (54) is  movable across the supporting surface in the given direction  in unison with, and in advance of, the pressing member (44) in  juxtaposed but spaced relationship thereto, the controller  member (54) presenting a wire deflecting surface position  above the wire supporting surface, to deflect parts of the wires  (2), which parts are adjacent to the pressing member (44),  away from the supporting surface so as to align each such part  with a recess.
