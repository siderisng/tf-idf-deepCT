<ABSTRACT>
The transistor has a stable stable conventional flow generation condensor mode and is sensitive to the magnetic field and can therefore be used as a magnetic detector, it comprises a source (1a), and two drains (4a), (4b), separated. by a distance (s) of conduction type opposite that of the substrate; an area (1b) of extension of the source comprises donor ions of minority carriers implanted which controls the injection of the minority carriers; A conductive electrode (7) placed above the substrate and separated from the substrate by an insulating layer serves as an accelerator for minority carriers and covers a portion of the transmitter and drains. Impact ionization makes it possible to obtain a variable avalanche voltage with the magnetic field. The characteristics of the structure of the transistor make it possible to create any avalanche voltage if the product of the electron-hole recombination probability probability murder m factor m factor is less than 1.
