<DESCRIPTION>
description " a method of manufacturing a semiconductor power device assembly this invention relates to a method of manufacturing an assembly including a semiconductor power device. it is well known that during normal usage semiconductor power devices generate sufficient heat to necessitate, in many applications, an associated heat sink. metals such as copper and aluminium having good thermal conductivity are often used to form heat sinks. it has previously been proposed to utilize aluminium plate as a heat sink in a semiconductor power device assembly wherein the device is electrically isolated from the heat sink plate by a tile of ceramic material. in this previously proposed device the ceramic tile carried printed circuit areas to one of which the power device was soldered. in order to achieve good thermal conduction between the device and the heat sink plate the ceramic tile carrying the printed circuit and the device was clamped to the plate with a layer of thermally conductive gel or grease interposed between the tile and the plate to fill any air gaps formed by the inherent non-planar surfaces of the plate and tile. in a second previously proposed assembly the ceramic tile having the printed circuit and device thereon was secured to the heat sink plate by means of a layer of thermally conductive adhesive. it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor power device assembly resulting in an assembly of simpler and more efficient construction than the previously proposed assemblies. a method of manufacturing a semiconductor power device assembly according to the invention includes the steps of starting with a heat sink plate, providing on one surface of the plate a thin layer of electrically insulating, thermally conductive material, said thin layer being supported by the plate, and securing a semiconductor power device to said layer in heat exchange relationship therewith. preferably said layer is provided with an electrically conductive surface region to which said device is secured. desirably said insulating layer is a ceramic material. preferably said ceramic layer is deposited on said plate by a spraying technique. conveniently said conductive surface region of said layer is part of an electrical conductor pattern on said layer. desirably said conductive surface region is provided on said layer by a screen printing technique. conveniently said heat sink plate is formed from aluminium. preferably said layer does not cover the whole of said surface of the plate, at least part of the surface of the plate not covered by said layer being in heat exchange relationship with an electrical circuit component carried on a ceramic tile located on said uncovered area of the plate. one example of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein: figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a semiconductor power device assembly, and figures 2 and 3 are sectional views (not to scale) on the lines 2-2 and 3-3 in figure 1. referring to the drawings, the assembly includes an aluminium heat sink plate
