<ABSTRACT>
a laminated film comprising a thermoplastic film and a layer of a film-forming polymer and metal particles is given a bright, metallic appearance if the metal particles are in the form of platelets having a thickness of about 1  mu m and an elongation of from about 10 to 50 mu m, if the platelets are essentially parallel to the surface of the plastic film, and if the layer on the backing film has a thickness with a weight of from 1 to 20 grammes per square metre, the amount by weight of metal particles in the layer, based on the total weight of film-forming polymers, being from 30 to 90% by weight.
