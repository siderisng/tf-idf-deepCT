<ABSTRACT>
method of storing thermal energy and apparatus for  collecting and storing it, particularly solar energy.  the  method makes use of a mixture of two chemical salts which  above a transformation temperature combine endothermically  to yield a mixture of two different salts, which different  salts combine exothermically to regenerate the original  mixture of salts below the transformation temperature.  the thermal storage apparatus for the collection and  storage of radiant solar thermal energy makes use of a heat  transfer fluid in combination with a heat-insulated container  containing a mixture of two suitable chemical salts.  a  particular salt pair described is:   2kno₃ + ba(oh)₂. 8h₂o 2koh. h₂o + bano₃ + 6h₂o

<DESCRIPTION>
if storage of thezeal energy" the invention relates to the storage of thermal energy, particularly solar energy, using a combination of chemical compounds. it is known to store thermal energy using isothermic containers. if water is used as a storage material it can be heated by, for example, solar energy to, for example, 900c and then stored for use when no sunlight is available. if the water is then cooled after storage to, for example, 400c it will be clear that 50 kcal/dm3 thermal energy can be stored. if used to cover the heat demands of a single family house the storage volume of water would need to be about 200 m3. this is a very large volume of water and therefore other materials have been tested with a view to finding materials which can store more thermal energy per dm3. the solar heat storage media which have been proposed and used up to now are water, rocks, salt hydrates, paraffins and other organic compounds. in water and rocks only the specific heat can be stored, while in some salt hydrates, paraffins and other organic compounds the latent heat of fusion and the specific heat can both be used for heat storage. if a temperature difference of 400c between the initial and final state of the storage system is considered, the storage capacities of some of these materials are: rocks 10 kcal/dm3 water 40 kcal/dm3 glauber's salt 115 kcal/dm3 (85 + o) paraffins and other 70 kcal/dm3 (40 + 30) -- organic compounds the values given in parentheses, are the respective contributions of the enthalpies of reaction and the specific heats to the total heat storage capacities of the materials. glauber's salt is the most used and most investigated salt hydrate because of its high heat of fusion and its low cost (see, for example, a, abhat et al v.d.i. berichte nr. 288 (1977) p. 97-104, and th. just d.f.v.1.r. nachrichten, febr. 1977 heft 20, p. 834-842) it has now been found however that the afore-mentioned materials can be replaced by systems of chemical compounds which react endothermically above a certain transformation telllpel^ature and which show a reverse reaction which is exotheric below thut temperature. according to the present invention there is provided a method of storing thermal energy which method comprises heating from a lower temperature to a higher temperature a mixture of a first salt with a second salt the said mixture of first and second salts having a transformation temperature between the said lower and higher temperatures above which transformation temperature the anions and cations of said first salt combine endothermically respectively with the cations and anions of said second salt to form a mixture of a third salt and a fourth salt, tulle anions and cations of said third salt combining exotheiitiically below said transformation temperature respectively with the cations and anions of said fourth salt so as to <rti id=2.17> regenerate said first and second salts. the present invention also provides apparatus for collecting and
