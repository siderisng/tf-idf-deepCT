<ABSTRACT>
a process for synthesizing 5,8-dialkoxy-2- hydroxy-2-­ acetyl- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and 5,8-dibenzyloxy-­ 2-hydroxy-2-acetyl- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene.  these  compounds are useful as intermediates in the synthesis of  doxorubicin, daunomycin and their analogs.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
tetrahydronaphthalene synthesis this invention relates to techniques for synthesizing precursors of doxorubicin and related compounds such as daunmycin and carminomycin, and the aglycones thereof. more specifically, the present invention pertains to a technique for synthesizing 5,8-dialkoxy-2-hydroxy-2-acetyl1,2 ,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene and 5,8-dibenzyloxy-2-hydroxy 2-acetyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, which compounds may be converted into anthracycline antibiotics, such as daunomycin and doxorubicin, using established techniques. doxorubicin is a known anthracycline antibiotic described, e.g., in u.s. patent no. 3,590,028. doxorubicin, and the closely related compound daunomycin, are antineoplastic agents of established clinical utility. doxorubicin hydrochloride, available from adria laboratories, inc., under the trade name adriamyci has been approved by the united states food and drug administration for use in clinical research, and is one of the most powerful anticancer drugs available against numerous forms of cancer. at present, doxorubicin is produced commercially from a soil fungus by a fermentation process. such techniques are inherently expensive and limit the types of molecules that can be produced. because of the inherent disadvantages of presently available commercial techniques for producing doxorubicin and related compounds, substantial effort has been devoted to developing processes for producing such com- pounds by chemical synthesis. techniques for the synthesis of anthracycline antibiotics such as doxorubicin and daunomycin are known. see, e.g., wong et al, canadian journal of chemistry, vol. 51, page 466 (1973); acton et al, journal of medicinal chernistry, vo. 17, c. 6, page 659 (1973j; ende et al, journal of the american chemical society, vol. 97, no. 15, page 4425 (1975) and vol. 98, no. 7, page 1967 (1976); sih et al, tetrahedron letters, page 3385 (1976); swenton et al, tetrahedron letters, page 2383 (1977); and kelly et al, journal of the american chemical society, vol. 99, page 5513 (1977). none of the known techniques for the total synthesis of anthracycline antibiotics such as daunomycin and doxorubicin have yet been proven to be commercially successful. because of the demand for, and scarcity of, these compounds, a suitable synthesis technique is highly desired. the present invention provides a suitable synthesis technique by providing precursors for synthesizing daunomycin and related compounds, which may be prepared from readily available and inexpensive starting materials. in accordance with the present invention, 5,8-dialkoxy-2 hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8-dibenzyloxy 2-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene are oxidized to produce 5,8-dialkoxy-2-keto-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8-dibenzyloxy-2-keto-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. these latter compounds are reacted with the lithium salt of methylvinyl ether to produce the desired 5,8-dialkoxy-2 hydroxy-2-acetyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene or 5,8-di benzyloxy-2-hydroxy-2-acetyl-l,2,3 ,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. the sequence of reactions described above provides a novel and convenient method for the preparation of 5,8dialkoxy- or 5,8-dibenzyloxy-2-hydroxy-2-acetyl-l,,3 ,4- tetrahydronaphthalene, which compounds are useful intermediates in the synthesis of doxorubicin, daunomycin, carminomycin, 4-demethoxydaunomycin and related anti tumour agents and their aglycones in accordance with established techniques such as those disclosed in, e.g., c. m. wong et al, canadian journal of chemistry, vol. 49, page 2712 (1971); vol. 51, page 466 (1973); and f. arcamone et al, cancer treatment reports, vol. 60, page 829 (1976). in the synthesis of the present invention, 5,8-alkoxyor 5,8-benzyloxy-2-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene is used as a starting material. these compounds may be prepared by
