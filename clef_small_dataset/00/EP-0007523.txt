<ABSTRACT>
a generally portable sheet material cutting tool compris­ ing apparatus having a substantially stationary sleeve  member (17) with a free end and a cutting tool (14) reciproc­ able within the sleeve member (17), the cutting tool (14) hav­ ing both a transverse cutting edge formed along its length  cooperable with the free end of the sleeve member (17) and an  initial hole forming means extending beyond the free end of  the sleeve member (17).  the reciprocation of the cutting tool  (14) is effected by cam means (16, 18) acting in response to  rotary motion supplied by a hand held drill (10) unit or by a  rotary drive motor, the cam means (16, 18) being capable of  being disengaged by axial pressure applied to the initial hole  forming means.  in one form of the apparatus the transverse  cutting edge is given both a reciprocating and a rotating com­ ponent of motion, and in a modified form of the apparatus the  transverse cutting edge is restrained for reciprocating move­ ment only.
