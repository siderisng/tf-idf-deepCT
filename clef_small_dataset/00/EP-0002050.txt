<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for cooling, drying and separating castings and moulding sand in a rotating cooling drum (1) whereby casted blocks are loaded into the front end of the cooling drum and the castings discharged from the other end of the drum whilst the moulding sand is discharged from a perforated section of the drum shell located in front of this end through a second chamer (2) surrounding said drum shell and through a second chamber (3) equipped with a suction device (6, 7), said second chamber (3) being connected to the first chamber (2) by a perforated partition, characterized by a stream of air being sucked from the cooling drum (1) through the first chamber (2) and second chamber (3) to simultaneously entrain moulding sand (9) from the first chamber into the second chamber where it separates from the air stream by the force of gravity and collects, water being jetted into the cooling drum, where required.
