<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a hard metal wear part, in particular for cutting tools, covered at least in the places subjected to wear of a laminate protective coating. This coating comprises at least five superimposed layers of which at least two are of different compositions; In addition, in this coating, the layer in contact with the surface of the part is a carbon layer, the outer layer is a layer of boride or carbide, and the intermediate layers are carbide layers, nitride, d oxide, boride and / or comb mixed with these. Such a coating can be obtained, for example, using the known deposition method by gaseous chemical reactions, and the wear part obtained has excellent wear resistance characteristics, both in cruster and in order, to Oxidation and shocks, and more makes it possible to achieve on the machine machined a better surface condition than with conventional coatings.
