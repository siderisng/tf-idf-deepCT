<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a corrugating roll (2) for a single-­ facer for corrugated board of the kind comprising a pair of  corrugating rolls (1,2) providing meshing fluted surfaces for  corrugating a web (3) fed therethrough and in which one face  of the corrugated web is attached to a liner web.  an object of the invention is to provide a single-facer of  this kind which, compared with known arrangements, is sim­ ple to manufacture and easy to maintain.  the invention is characterized in that said corrugating roll  is in the form of a roll cell fluted on its outer peripheral surface,  a plurality of grooves are provided at appropriate spaced  intervals along the outer peripheral surface of said roll cell so  as to encircle said roll cell in the circumferential direction at  right angles to said flutes, a plurality of bores (24) are provided  in said roll cell which extend almost over its entire length,  which bores respectively open into one common end surface  of said roll cell and partly communicate with the bottoms of  said grooves, and suction means disposed at said common  one end surface of said roll cell for applying suction via said  bores and grooves.
