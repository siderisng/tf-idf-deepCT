<ABSTRACT>
the difficulties of providing a splint or stretcher, for use  for example at the scene of an accident, which is both conveniently  stored and easily assembled and applied are overcome  by providing a blank for a splint or stretcher of corrugated  plastic material.  this has a panel 12 consisting of  spaced apart sheets joined by longitudinal ribs which on  folding forms a base 22 and outer sidewalls 24,26 and an  extension panel 14 which forms an extension base 40 and  extension walls 42,44.  portions 48,49 are pressed out on  assembly and tabs 31,32 engage slots 58,60 to hold the  panels 14 and 10 in a selected orientation thus providing an  arm splint.  panels 14 and 10 may alternatively be kept  aligned and extension 82 folded at fold line 72 and kept in  position by locking panels 84 and 86 thus providing a splint  for a leg.  a panel of the same shape and larger dimensions, if  only the sides 42,24,84; 44,26,86 are folded, may be used as a  stretcher.  the design and plastics material results in a light,  easily stored, easily assembled and inexpensive splint or  stretcher which is also substantially transparent to x rays.
