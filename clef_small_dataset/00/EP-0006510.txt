<ABSTRACT>
In the method for producing each other in a N- or p-type silicon substrate, a first, higher than the silicon substrate (2) doped region is tested, then it is ensured that the silicon surface there where the The first region (4) is and a second area should arise, is exposed, and then thermally oxidized at a relatively low temperature, wherein above the first region (4), a thicker oxide layer (8b) grows higher than above the second Be rich. Subsequently, the oxide layer (8a, 8b) is etched until it is removed above the second range to be produced, and finally, the second region (11) is generated by doping in the then exposed substrate ranges, the above the first area (4) Residual oxide layer (8c) serves as a doping mask. This doping mask is self-adjusted. The method is used in particular for producing subcollric and isolation areas (4 and 11) of base and collector regions of lateral PNP transistors and tunnels diodes.
