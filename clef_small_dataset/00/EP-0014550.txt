<ABSTRACT>
after an electron tube is exhausted and sealed, a base (18)  is pushed into position on the stem (12) of the tube the space  between the stem and the base, at least around one pin (14) of  the tube destined to have high voltages applied to it, is filled  with a sealing substance; and then the stem and the pins are  heated until the sealing substance is at least partially cured by  heat from the stem to form a dielectric material (32).
