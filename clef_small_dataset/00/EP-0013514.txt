<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for hot-air drying of the type comprising a drying chamber (1), a circuit for supplying the drying chamber with hot air comprising a device for heating the air (6), a circuit for removal of the hot air loaded with vapour, and an air/air heat exchanger (4), the hot fluid circuit of which is connected in series in the circuit for removal of hot air loaded with vapour, and the cold fluid circuit of which is connected in series in the circuit for supplying hot air upstream of the heating device (6).  the cold fluid circuit of the heat exchanger (4) comprises, at an intermediate point, an auxiliary inlet (12) for external air, which is provided with a variable obturator (13) controlled by a conventional regulating chain (14) as a function of the hygrometric degree or of a quantity associated with the hygrometric degree of the air leaving the hot fluid circuit of the exchanger (4).  <image>
