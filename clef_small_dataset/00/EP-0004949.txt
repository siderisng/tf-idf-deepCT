title of the invention" 4-aza-17-substituted-5&alpha;-androstan-3-one-testosterones, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical com- positions containing the same background of te invention field of the invention the present invention is concerned with novel 4-aza-17-substituted-5&alpha;-androstan-3-ones and their a and dhomo analogs7 and the use of these compounds as testosterone 5-reductase inhibitors. description of the prior art it is well known in the art that certain undesirable physiological manifestations, such as acne vulgaris, seborrhoea, female hirsutism, and male pattern baldness and benign prostatic hypertrophy7 are the re sult of hyperandrogenic stimulation caused by an excel sive accumulation of testosterone or similar androgen hormones in the metabolic system. early attests to provide a chemotherapeutic agent to counter the undesir- able results of hyperandrogenicity resulted in the dis- covery of several steroidal antiandrogens having undesirable hormonal activities of their own. the estrogens, for example, not only counteract the effect of the androgens but have a feminizing effect as well. non-steroidal antiandrogens have also been developed, for example, 4'-nitro-3'-trifluoromethylisobutyranilide. see neri et al., endo., vol. 91, no. 2 (1972). however, these products, though devoid of hormonal effects, are peripherally active, competing with the natural androgens for receptor sites, and hence have a tendency to feminize a male host or the male fetus of a female host. it more recently became known in the art that the principal mediator of androgenic activity in some target organs is 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone, and that it is formed locally in the target organ by the action of testosterone-5&alpha;-reductase. it therefore has been postulatex and demonstrated that inhibitors of testosterone-5creductase will serve to prevent or lessen symptoms of hyperandrogenic stimulation. nayfeh et al., steroids, 14, 269 (1969) demonstrate in vitro that methyl 4-androsten-3- one-17ss-carboxylate was a testosterone-5c-reductase in hibitcr. then voigt and asia, endocrinology, 92, 1216 (1973), canadian patent no. 970,692, demonstrated that the above esther and the parent free acid, 4-androsten-3-one-17ss- carboxylic acid are both active inhibitors of testosterone 5&alpha;-reductase in vitro. they further demonstrated that topical application of either testosterone or 5&alpha;-dihydro- testosterone caused enlargement of the female hamster flank organ, an androgen dependent sebaceous structure. however, concommitant administration of 4-androsten-3-one-17 -car- boxylic acid or its methyl ester inhibited the response elicited by testosterone but did not inhibit the response elicited by 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone. these results were interpreted as indicating that the compounds were anti androgenic by virtue of their ability to inhibit testo sterone-5&alpha;-reductase. the novel compounds of the present invention are, therefore, selective antiandrogens by virtue of their ability to specifically inhibit testosterone-5a-reductase. heretofore, it has not been known to use 4-aza 17-substituted-5&alpha;-androstan-3-ones for treating hyperandrogenic conditions, although selye, in belgian patent no. 775,919, describes such a compound, and a number of other compounds, additionally having one or more carbonitrile substituents, as a catatoxic agent useful in the treatment of, among other conditions, prostatic hypertrophy. a number of 4-aza steroid compounds are known. see, for example, u.s. patents nos. 2,227,876; 3,239,417; 3,264,301; and 3,285,918; french patent no. 1,465,544; doorenbos and solomons, j. phar. sci. 62, 4, pp. 638-640 (1973) and doorenbos
