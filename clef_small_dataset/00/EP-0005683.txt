<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes an optical fiber, at least one of the end faces comprises a plane-convex microlenet plotted by its flat face against said end face.According to the invention, said optical fiber is a multimode fiber having a core having a diameter of at least about ten micrometers, and said microlentil is a spherical cap-shaped lens made of a transparent thermoplastic material, the plane side ofThis microlentil having an extension at least equal to the cross section of the core of the fiber.Application in particular to the injection of light in optical fibers.
