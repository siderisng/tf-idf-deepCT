<ABSTRACT>
combined, inactivated vaccine, ready for administra­ tion and active against at least newcastle disease and egg  production drop caused by adeno like viruses and process  for the preparation of such vaccine.  the vaccine is prepa­ red by addition of a newcastle disease virus (ndv) con­ taining liquid, obtained by cultivation of a ndv, followed by  inactivation of this liquid and optionally homogenizing it,  together with an adeno like virus (alv) containing liquid,  obtained by cultivation of an alv, followed by inactivation  of this liquid and optionally homogenising it, to an oily pha­ se containing as essential components at least one of  the components selected from the group consisting of light  mineral paraffinic oils, plant oils and naphtenic mineral oils  and one or more emulsifiers, such as non ionic surface-ac­ tive compound derived from alkylene oxide and/or hexahy­ dric alcohols and/or higher natural fatty acids such as  esters or ester-ethers, optionally followed by homogenising  and/or addition of a preservative.
