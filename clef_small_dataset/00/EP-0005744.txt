<ABSTRACT>
In the method for growing epitaxial seals on selectively highly doped silicon substrates, the substrate is first heated in a hydrogen atmosphere in the range between about 1120 and about 1180 ° C for a fixed time long, then cooled to a temperature in the range between about 1000 and about 1100 ° C.and finally exposed to a gas stream which contains hydrogen as a carrier gas and silicon tetrachloride as a source material for the silicon.The epitaxial layer grows up.The method preferably produces epitaxial seals which are <2 μm thick and used in very highly integrated circuits.
