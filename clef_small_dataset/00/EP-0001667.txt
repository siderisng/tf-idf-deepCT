<ABSTRACT>
a cluster-remover for a milking cluster comprises a lifting  tube (17) equipped with a supporting frame (16) and forming  the cylinder of a horizontally disposed piston-cylinder assembly  (17, 18).  a lifting mechanism comprises the piston (18) of  said assembly, a pulley (19) mounted on the piston (18), a  further pulley (21) mounted on the tube (17) and a string (22).   one end of the string is fixed (at 23) to the tube (17) and at the  other end it has a loop (24) for suspending the milking cluster,  in between the string passing around the two pulleys (19, 21).   accessories such as a valve (12) for admitting or obdurating  vacuum to the cylinder (17) and electronic means (14) operating  the valve (12) under the control of a milk indicator (13) are  mounted on the frame (16).  the frame (16) is arranged for  quick-coupling connection with a bearing block (66) connected  to fixed joints or connection points for electricity and  vacuum supplies (such as 77) and milk flow-discharge.  a  quasi-rigid connection is provided in the combination of lifting  tube (17), supporting frame (16) and bearing block (66)  with the tube (17) resiliently held to the frame (16) by a tension  spring (34).
