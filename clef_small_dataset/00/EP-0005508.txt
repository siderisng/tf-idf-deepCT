<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus is disclosed which is mountable in a  strapping machine frame adjacent a strap chute and adjacent  a strap end gripping and sealing assembly.  the apparatus  has a pivotably mounted strap guide arm and gripper for  guiding the strap during feeding in a first, upper position and  for gripping the strap when the arm moves downwardly  away from the first position.  the strap is both fed into the  strap chute and subsequently pre-tensioned by a pair of  coacting feedwheels.  a high tension pinion gear is mounted  for rotation on an axis which is fixed relative to, and movable  with, the strap guide arm.  the pinion gear engages a rack  member which is secured on one end to the strapping  machine frame and which transmits the reaction force from  the pinion gear to the strapping machine frame when the  pinion gear is rotated in engagement with the rack.  a single,  reversible, rotating drive motor is mounted for movement  with the guide arm and powers a gear drive assembly which  is engaged with the motor and movable therewith for (1)  rotating the feedwheels to feed the strap when the motor is  rotating in a first direction, (2) rotating the feedwheels to  withdraw the strap to pretension the loop with a first  predetermined tension when the motor is rotating in a  second direction, and (3) rotating the high tension pinion  gear when both (a) the motor is rotating in the second  direction and (b) the tension in the strap exceeds the  predetermined, first tension.  during high tensioning, the  pinion gear moves along the rack and pivots the guide arm  out of the first position to a second position whereby the  gripper is actuated to grip the trailing portion of the strap and  pull the gripped strap, thereby drawing a higher, second  tension in the loop.
