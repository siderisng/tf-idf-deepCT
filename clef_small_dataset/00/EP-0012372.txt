<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a container-like hollow cylinder-shaped support shell (a) of thermoformable film, the support sheath barriers (2) each having a central opening (4) in the shell cavity is a hollow rod (b) of greedy, tubular packaging shell, which is released from the support shell under release a mouth opening (9) is surrounded; The support sheath end walls (2) are formed as outwardly projecting, longitudinally compressed, form-permanent, longitudinal saxient support sheathed drills with central, straight, at both ends of the cavity at both ends. The invention further relates to a method for the manufacture of the designated unit, in which a cylindrical sleeve of thermoformable film is arranged around the hollow rod, the length of which is dimensioned so that sheaths are each outstanding on both sides over the hollow curves, which converts shell supernatants into closure elements By tapping them longitudinally partially as well as narrowing of their inner diameter, they are compressed to twisted lungs with longitudinal central central, at both ends of a cavity of cavity and the twilile in the form-permanent state converted. The invention also comprises the use of the radio tional unit in the sausage production.
