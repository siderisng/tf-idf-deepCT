<ABSTRACT>
non-supported, fixed bed catalyst tablets made by spray  drying a slurry of the components into microspheres followed  by tabletting the microspheres under high pressure in  apparatus such as punch and die sets.  the catalysts formed  according to the process of this invention have better catalytic  performance and/or crush strength than do conventionally  made pellets such as extrudates.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved dehydrogenation catalyst tablet and method for making same non-supported, fixed-bed catalyst pellets are used in many chemical processes. among these are processes for dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and oxidation of organics. dehydrogenation processes using such fixed- -bed, non-supported catalysts include the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to produce styrene, of ethyl toluene to produce vinyl toluene, and of butane or butene to produce butadiene. hydrogenation processes which use such fixed -bed, non-supported catalysts include such processes as thau for producing saturated hydrocarbons from olefins. oxidation processes which use such fixed-bed, non-supported catalyst pellets include such processes as those for making aldehydes and acids from saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g., acrylic acid from po- pylene. for the sake of conciseness, the word "pellets" is hereinafter used as a generic term to include those spray dried tablets made by the process of this invention as well as other forms of pellets made by such processes as extrusion, i.e., extrudates. "tablet" is defined to be any pellet made by the process of this invention. in the past, improvements in the catalytic performance and/or crush strength of non-supported catalyst pellets for the processes referred to above, have generally been obtained by changing the formulation of components. typically such non-supported catalyst pellets are made by extruding a paste of components through cylindrical dies to form moist cylinders having a diameter of from about 1/16 inch to about 1/2 inch (0.16 -1.27 cm). as these cylinders exit from the extruder the are usually either chopped into predetermined lengths or allowed to break of their own weight, forming cylindrical pellets (extrudates) having a length of from about 1/8 inch (0.32 cm) to about one inch (2.54 cm). methods other than extrusion have been taught for forming non-supported catalyst pellets. for example u.s. patent 1,680,807 (august 14, 1928) teaches the formation of catalyst pellets by compression of a multiplic ity of fine particles of catalytic material, which particles are not naturally coherent in the dry state. spray drying of fluid bed catalysts is known. see u.s. patents 2,768,145 (tongue et al. 1956) and 1,680,807 (scultze 3928). spray drying catalyst materials on catalyst carriers or supports is known. see u.s. patent 2,435,379 (archibald 1948). the present invention is directed to a method for making an unsupported fixed-bed catalyst tablet, said method characterized by (a) spray drying a slurry of catalyst source constituents into microspheres; and (b) forming the catalyst tablet by subjecting a elected amount of the microspheres to compres sive pressure. for some unknown reason this coinbination of steps produces a catalyst tablet having superior catalytic performance and/or crush strength qualities. the present invention is also directed to catalyst tablets made by the process described immedi- ately above. it solid be noted that the phrase "a slurry of catalyst source components" is used above in the spray drying step as opposed to "a slurry of catalyst components". this is done to point out that sometimes the constituents used in making up the slurr for spray drying are not the same components
