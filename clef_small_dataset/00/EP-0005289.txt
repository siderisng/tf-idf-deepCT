<ABSTRACT>
in a multi-channel x-ray fluorescence analyzer a multi-channel  memory (64) is interconnected between an attribute  memory bank (60, 62), a display circuitry (66) and an  analog-digital converter (56).  a memory channel is identified  as a member of a small group of channels representing  elemental energy peak width, wherein one or more of the  channels of the group are located in the multi-channel  memory of a computer (i. e. , a first multi-channel memory)  and others of the channels of the group are located in one  or more further multi-channel memories that are, as stated  above, not located in an associated computer but, instead,  in a separate attribute memory bank, with the operation  of the memory or memories of the attribute memory bank  being configurated by an associated computer circuit and  operating independently and asynchronously of the computer.   the invention also covers a display circuitry (66)  for a non-line television display (67).

<DESCRIPTION>
"multi-channel analyzer" the present invention relates to a multichannel analyzer, particularly to a multi-channel Â¯x-ray # fluorescence analyzer. such kind of analysing apparatus are described in the edase editor vol. 8 no.2, page 6-10. in an apparatus as described a sample of material is struck by an x-ray beam in known fashion and the radiation from the sample resulting from x-ray excitation thereof, is collected and analyzed. in another application a scanning electron microscope (sem) is utilized, in which an electron beam strikes a sample and the resulting ,radiation from the sample is collected and anlyzed. according to the prior art, such analysis of the resulting radiation from the sample, involves feeding the signals or information from the sample into a pre-amplifier of a known multi-channel analyzer. the signals from the pre-amplifier are then fed into an analog-to-digital converter from which information is transferred to a comparator, which generally comprises an upper range limit comparator and a lower range limit comparator. these comparators serve to analyze the information received from the converter and to determine and respond to those items of information or signals whose intensity levels, which are indicative of elements present in the materials of the sample, falls between the pre-established upper and lower range limits for which the comparators are set. the signals from the analog-to-digital converter are also fed into a multi-channel memory, where the varioussignals identifying the elemental characteristics of the analyzed sample, are stored. the output signals from the comparators thus those signals which fall within the pre-established range defined by the comparators are fed into an event detector which can be an "or-gate" and pulse former and which registers the occurrence of the various signals from the comparators. signals or intelligence from the event detector are fed into the output circuitry which in turn can be fed to for example, a scanning electron microscope that constructs an image of the analyzed sample area in accordance with the incoming signals from the event detector. the apparatus also includes a marker counter, whose function it is to produce indices on the display and locate them appropriately. the attributes can be, for example, the image intensity, or brightness, the display grid, the display range scale, the width of the display window, and, in spectrometry, the k.l. and m marks, as explained below. information from the multi-channel memory is fed into display circuitry of the apparatus, which can be the circuitry for a television display, on which there can be shown various information indicating the characteristics of the sample, one such characteristic being the intensity, or population, level of signals corresponding to a certain energy or wavelength indicative of a particular chemical element, e.g. iron, the intensity being related to the chemical content of this particular element in the sample. in this particular type of application, wavelength/energy information is stored in a number of sequential memory channels of the multi-channel memory. in asmuch as particular energies, and, therefore, particular channels, relate to specific elements under analysis, it
