<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to devices for use in sterilizing  contact lenses.  the device incorporates a casing enclosing a flat heater  block (42′) comprising a primary segment (42a) and an  extension segment (42b) of less size and mass than the  primary segment extending from one side of the primary  segment, the primary segment being formed with a support  surface (62) and with a recess (64) accommodating an  electrical heating element (66) and the extension segment  supporting in contact therewith a thermostat (70) in controll­ ing connection with the heating element.  the device provides that the support surface will reach  the desired sterilizing temperature and remains at that  temperature long enough to sterilize lenses in a case (46)  resting on the surface before the thermostat operates  because owing to the differential masses of the primary  segment and the extension segment the rate of heat transfer  to the thermostat is less than the rate of heat transfer to the  support surface.
