<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for laying on a substantially cylindrical receiving body a sheathing sleeve comprising a flexible material, the resiliency of which acts in the radial direction thereof, including the following steps : a) said sleeve is applied by being radially distorted against a support tube of substantially the same length, the wall of which is provided with at least an aperture for venting air enclosed between sleeve and support tube, b) said sleeve is maintained in such an applied position against support tube by means of atmospheric pressure, c) support tube and receiving body are slindingly moved one with respect to the other in order to bring them in a position ready for sheathing, d) air is re-admitted between tube and sleeve so that the latter may release, thereby allowing it to be resiliently applied on receiving body, wherein air venting is carried out by submitting sleeve face disposed opposite to tube to a pressure above atmospheric pressure ; said aperture(s) (27, 44) provided in support tube is temporarily closed so that atmospheric pressure keeps sleeve against tube ; finally said aperture(s) is opened into the sheathing position, and sleeve ands are disengaged so that the sleeve release may take place.
