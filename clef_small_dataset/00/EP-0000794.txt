<ABSTRACT>
1.  dual-circuit control valve, especially for a braking system of motor vehicles, having two separate valves (8, 19) which are disposed one after the other in a valve housing (1) and are equipped with valve springs (12, 29), also having an actuating rod (2) which enters the valve housing and co-operates therein mechanically with one portion of the first separate valve (8) by way of a travel spring (5) and a piston (6), and having a device for actuating the second separate valve (19) and having a balancing piston (17) which is subjected to the two brake pressures introduced into two brake circuits, and also having a stem (35) which can counteract the effect of a compression spring (30) inserted between the balancing piston and a fixed housing wall, characterised in that the valve spring (12) of the first separate valve (8) is supported, at the one end, against the balancing piston (17) and, at the other end, by way of a valve closure element (13) against the housing (valve seat 9), and its force support upon the balancing piston (17) when the control valve is unactuated is alleviated by the compression spring (30), also in that the stem (35) is secured to the piston (6), which is moved by the actuating rod (2), and reaches through the first separate valve (8) in a manner known per se, and in that the force of the valve spring (29), which acts upon the balancing piston (17), upon such an actuation, by way of a closure element (28) of the second separate valve (19), against the force of the valve spring (12) of the first separate valve (8) is compensated in a counterbalanced manner.
