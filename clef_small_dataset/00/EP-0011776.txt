<ABSTRACT>
The sterilization device comprises a Zylindri sliced ​​pressure boiler with two superimposed chambers (3, 4) separated by a partition wall (2). The lower chamber (4) has a feed opening (5) for the medium to be deflected. The cylindrical upper chamber (3) is connected via the partition wall (2) by mounting openings (7) distributed among different radii (7) for the medium with the chamber (4). In the boiler, a drain pipe (15) is arranged, the upper part (14) in the upper chamber (3) is located, and an inlet opening has at the upper end and its lower part (17) the partition wall (2) and the lower chamber ( 4) and has the drain opening for the boiler at the bottom. In each inlet opening (7) of the partition wall (2), a UV tube (10) with its lower end is supported via vanes (8), which give the inflowing medium a circulation around the deputy UV tube. The UV tubes (10) enforce the chamber (3) and an upper intermediate disc (18) and are supported with their upper ends in a trim remote boiler wall (12).
