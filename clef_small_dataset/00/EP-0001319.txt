<ABSTRACT>
5-(p-hydroxyphenyl) hydantoin of formula (i):    is prepared by reacting phenol, glyoxylic acid and urea in the  presence of an acid catalyst in an aqueous medium.  the hydantoin may be hydrolysed to produce the amino  acid,p-hydroxyphenylglycine, preferably to the d-amino acid,  either by selective enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent  chemical hydrolysis, or by alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent  resolution.
