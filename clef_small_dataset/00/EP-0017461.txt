<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus employs two or more beams of radiation  of different spectral composition which are transmitted  through a sample (3) and received by a detector (8) which  provides signals for computing the required parameter by  ration measurements.  the beams are directed to a sample  zone where a part is transmitted through, and a part is  reflected by a sample (3).  the invention provides diffusing  means (7) to receive the transmitted and reflected parts and  pass the same onto a radiation responsive detector (8).  the  diffusing means (7) may be a ground glass plate or a  member made of fused alumina.  a concave mirror (9) may  be used to reflect the reflected part back through the sample  zone which is close to or at the centre of curvature of the  mirror.  a beamsplitter (12) may also be used so that the  beams are directed substantially normal to a plane in the  sample zone.
