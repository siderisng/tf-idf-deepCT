<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for the ultrasonic investigation and representation of an object on an image display device (11), in which by means of an ultrasonic transmitter/receiver system (80, 130) and a displaceable scanning mirror (70) the object is scanned in a pulsed manner in a section plane by an ultrasonic beam, the ultrasonic pulses corresponding to a section plane, which form approximately equidistant rays in the object, being triggered at a timing different from the line scan timing of the image display device (11), caracterised in that the echo signals received per section plane are read line-wise into a storage system (200), and read out from the storage system (200) with a line frequency suited to the line scan frequency of the image display device (11) and are used for brightness control of the image points of the image display device (11).
