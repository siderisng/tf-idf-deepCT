<ABSTRACT>
a pipe coupling for use with adjacent pipe ends of a  particular diameter, the coupling comprising a generally  cylindrical sleeve adapted to overlie the adjacent pipe ends  and having a sealing ring for engagement with the exterior  surface of the pipe ends.  in order to facilitate fitting and allow for deviations in  the dimensions of the pipe ends, the sleeve is formed of a  semi-elastic material and has an intergral annular rib (25)  in its longitudinal mid-portion, the rib dividing the coupling  into two sections each having an inner portion (27, 28)  with circumferentially spaced integral ridges (30) formed  thereon to engage the exterior surface of the pipe and an  outer larger diameter portion (12, 13) accommodating the  sealing ring (15, 16) which resiliently engages the outer  surface of the pipe.
