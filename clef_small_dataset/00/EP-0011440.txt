<ABSTRACT>
a double-pole, trigger-operated switch for controlling  the speed of an electric motor, particularly in a portable tool,  comprises two screw-clamp terminals for connection to the  power lines and having respective stationary contacts 36, 38  connected thereto, two movable contacts 30, 32 pivotally  mounted at their upper ends to a printed circuit board to  which a control circuit is connected and pivotally connected  at mid-points to respective limbs of a nylon cam follower 28,  so that depression of the trigger 6, depressing with it an  actuator 26 having a cam 26c, causes downwards movement  of cam follower 28, guided in a race 2m, to spread its limbs  and pivot the movable contacts into contact with stationary  contacts 36, 38.
