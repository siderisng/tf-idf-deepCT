<ABSTRACT>
The single or double folding z. b. Apparatus serving from post items consists of three transport sections: endless tapes (4), pivot plate (5) and endless bands (8). The upper trums of the endless tapes (4 and 8) and the surface of the pivot plate in outgoing position lie on a plane via which the lower trum of the endless tapes (3) of an upper group is guided in the starting position. The sheet (14) to be folded are transported between the endless bands (3 and 4) via the pivot plate (5) to a stop (9) in the region of the third portion, whereupon the bands stopped and the pivot plate (5) around its third Section facing back edge (11) is pivoted by 180 ° Ge. The bands (3) fold the sheet (14) (1st folding) on ​​the front edge (12) of the pivot plate (5), and the back edge (11) folds the sheet (14) by means of a holder (7) (2 .  folding). After completion of the pivoting of the pivot plate (5), it is pushed back into its starting position on the table by swinging front guide rollers (17) of the bands (8) and adjusting the stop (9) is achieved simply folding.
