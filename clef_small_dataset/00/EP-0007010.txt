<ABSTRACT>
The invention is new compounds of formula I in which R₁ is methyl or phenyl which is optionally by halogena tome (C₁-C₄) -alkyl radicals or (C₁-C₄) alkoxy residues or (C₁-C₄) alkoxy radicals and R₂ is a R₃O group. In the R₃ alkyl which optionally additionally by halogen (C₁-C₄) alkoxy radicals or alko xycarbonyl radicals is substituted, alkynyl cycloalkyl, which may optionally be additionally hydrogenated by (C₁-C₄) alkyl radicals, phenyl, which may optionally by halogena tome and / or the F₃C group is substituted, or R₂ is a R₄ group. in the R₄ hydrogen or (C₁-C₄) alkyl substituted, alkoxycarbonyl substituted, and R₅ (C₁-C₄) alkyl or phenyl, optionally by halogen atoms, F₃C radicals, (C₁-C₄) alkyl or (C₁-C₄) alkoxy residues or substituted by phenoxy or halophenoxy, and a method for their preparation by reacting 1,2,4-triazole with a corresponding halide, as well as their use for pest control and as plant growth regulus. The preparation of the thalogen used as a bodies is made of the associated acid halide.
