<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the treatment of glass spectacle lenses by chemical tempering in a bath of a molten salt.  the chemical tempering operation is split into two stages: (a) a pretempering performed after the lens has been given the desired surface finish and curvature and taking place under specified operating conditions and during all the time needed to obtain the required characteristics of surface compression and layer depth; (b) a retempering carried out by the optician after shaping of the lens, and of a much shorter duration than the pretempering.
