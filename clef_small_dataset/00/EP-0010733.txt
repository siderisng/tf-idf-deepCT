<ABSTRACT>
a guideway for use, for example, as an elevated road­ way is constructed by forming guideway units comprising a  massive elongated metal channel (20) having one or a plu­ rality, usually at least three, tubular metal tension void-­ forming members (30) running lengthwise down its interior  and connected to its inside wall along its entire length.  the  void-forming members (30) may be connected to the chan­ nel wall via longitudinal (36) and/or transverse (84) web  members.  transverse shear connectors may also be pro­ vided.  the ends of the channel (20) are closed and after  hoisting each unit into position on spaced supports (46)  which engage beneath its ends it is filled with settable  material (70), usually concrete, which encloses the void-­ forming members (30) to form a composite structure.  the  side walls preferably are inclined inward (26) between a  bottom sheet (22) and top vertical portions (24) of the side  walls to give an aesthetic appearance, provide streamlining  and reduce unwanted dead weight.
