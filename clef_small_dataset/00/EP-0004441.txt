<ABSTRACT>
an eggbox, which is a one-piece moulding of plastics sheet  material, comprises a base part (1) having egg-receiving  pockets (4) and a cover part (2) having corresponding pockets  (25) hinged together along mutually adjacent rims so that the  cover part can be folded over the base part to close the latter.  in  the closed position, the parts (1, 2) are fastened together at their  rims opposite the hinge (3) by cooperating studs (36) and slots  (37) formed respectively on the two parts.  the slots (37) are of  keyhole shape and, when the cover part is closed, the studs (36)  initially engage in the wider portions of the slots and are urged  into engagement with the narrower portions by the inherent  resiliency of the parts in order to fasten the parts together.  a  second set of cooperating studs (43) and slots (44), which  interengage in the manner of press-stud fasteners, are formed  centrally of the base and cover parts in order to assist in  fastening the parts together.
