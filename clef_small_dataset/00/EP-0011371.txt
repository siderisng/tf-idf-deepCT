<ABSTRACT>
a fibrillated film (2) in the form of a tube is passed over a  former (6) which is tapered out from an initial circumference  which is less than the circumference of the unopened fibril­ lated tube (2) to a larger circumference appropriate to the  degree of opening required for the fibrillated film (2).  the  former (6) is constructed so that every point on the perimeter  of a transverse cross section is equidistant from the perimeter  of any other transverse cross-section.  thus the film is opened  evenly.  also, by the adjustment of the collection speed, com­ pensation is made for the reduction in length of the film (2).

   description description    "method and apparatus for opening fibrillated film networks"  the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for opening fibrillated film networks.    in particular the present invention relates to   a    method and apparatus for   opening    a fibrillated tubular film formed by any suitable process,  fibrillated tubular films may be opened by gripping the network at each side edge e. g. stentering,   and    stretching   the      network    transversely to its length.   however,   when    a fibrillated   film    is opened in the transverse direction there is a contraction in the length of the film and this reduction in length is, as will be appreciated, difficult to compensate for in a continuous operation   wnerein    the side edges of the network are gripped also such   methods      of    gripping   neeessa-ily    limit the   width    of the film   which    may be   fully    and   evenly    opener.    the aim of the present invention is to provide a method and   apparatus    by means of which a fibrillated tubular network can be evenly and sully opened on a continuous basis, it being a simple matter to continuously compensate for the reduced length output in comparison with the input.    according to the present invention there is provided a method of opening fibrillated film   networks    comprising   passing    a   fibrillated    tubular film over a former which is tapered out   from    an initial circumference of less than or equal to the circumference of the unopenea fibrillated tube, to a   larder    circumference appropriate to the degree of opening required of the fibrillated film.    the tubular film may be produced by the conventional processes of blown film technology when a suitable   synthetic      plastics      material    may be extruded   through    an. annular   ring    die,   the    tubular film may be   cooled    by a controlled air current, the tubular film is then collapsed to a double-layer sheet by passing  the former (6) is a tapered cone which has a major and a minor axis when considered in transverse cross-section.    10. apparatus as claimed in claim 9, in which   the    cone   ns    hollow to enable a heating medium to be passed therethrough.    11. apparatus as claimed in claim 8, in which the former (6)   comprises    at least two different   sive    rings (18) arranged co-axially   with    respect to each other and parallel to each other, the rings (18) each having a major and a minor   axis.         .12.    apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 11, in which the   former    (6) is designed so that every point on the perimeter of a cross-section of the former (6) transverse to the intended direction of feed of the tubular film, is equidistant from the perimeter of any other transverse cross-section of the former (6).    13. apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 12, in which cutters (7) are provided for cutting the tubular opened   network    as it leaves the former (6), to produce two substantially   plantar    networks parallel to each other.     14. apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 13, in which grippers (11) are provided for gripping the side edges of the opened network after it leaves the former (6), to thus retain the opened configuration.    15. apparatus as claimed in claim 14, in which the grippers (11) are formed by pairs of contiguous endless belts,  16. apparatus as claimed in any one of   c12irs    8 to 15, in   which    a winder assembly (9) is provided for collecting the opened network, the winder assembly (9) being arranged to collect the network at a slower speed than the speed at   which    it is fed to the former (6) by feeding means   (f).
