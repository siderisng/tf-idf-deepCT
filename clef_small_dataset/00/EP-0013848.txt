<ABSTRACT>
1.  turning lathe equipped with a horizontal rotary workpiece (5) - holder spindle (4), as well as whit a first toolholder carriage (13), the displacements of which are assured by means (26-27-28) subject to numerical control (32) and a second carriage (16) which supports an automatic rough-workpiece-charging and machines-workpiece-discharging device (61), these two carriages (13-16) being mounted for sliding movement on distinctive horizontal slides (11-12-14-15) parallel to the axis of the horizontal rotary workpiece-holder spindle (4), the second carriage (16) supporting a bolt system (41, 52) subject to the control of the numerical control (32), and adapted to cooperate, in a first position, with a keeper (42) integral with the first carriage (13) in order to make the second carriage temporarily fast with the first, characterized in that the bolt system (41, 52) is a two locking positions system having a unique control (44) adapted to cooperate, in the second position with a stationary keeper (53) in order to immobilize temporarily the second carriage.
