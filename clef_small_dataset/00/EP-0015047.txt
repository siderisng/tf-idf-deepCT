<ABSTRACT>
a chamber (41) within which a rotor (1) is to be rotated is  provided with a wall (5) encircling the rotor (1) when the rotor  (1) is in position and generally coaxial with the axis of rotation  of the rotor (1), whereby the wall (5) is pivotably mounted so  that it can pivot about an axis (10) from an inoperative position  permitting access to the rotor to an operative position encirclÂ­ ing the rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
centrifuge assembly the present invention relates to a centrifuge assembly. with many forms of centrifuge, the rotor is removeably mounted on the drive shaft so that different rotors may be used in the one centrifuge. however, problems are encountered with changing the rotors since they are heavy. female operators often find it difficult to raise and lower the rotors into ihe rotor chamber, notably with centrifuges which are mounted on a worx surface as opposed to being free standing cabinet machines. furthermore, the rotor crust be housed within a guard ring to protect operators in case of rotor failure. this guard ring further hinders ready access to the rotor, but can not be dispensed with. iy7e have now devised a form of centrifuge assembly which reduces the above problems. accordingly, the present invention provides a centrifuge assembly comprising a chamber within which a rotor is to be rotated, the chamber being provided with a wall encircling the rotor when the rotor is in position and generally coaxial with the axis of rotation of the rotor, characterised in that the wall is pivotably mounted so that it can pivot about an axis from an inoperative position permitting access to the rotor to an operative position encircling the rotor. for convenience, the invention will be described with reference to a preferred form thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings in which figure 1 is a diagrammatic vertical cross section of a centrifuge; figure 2 shows a detail of the centrifuge of figure 1; figure 3 is a diagrammatic part skeltal view of a counterbalance mechanism for use in the centrifuge of figure 1; and figure 4 is a detailed view of part of the mechanism of figure 3. the centrifuge comprises a conventional removeable rotor 1 mounted on a shaft 2 driven by a motor via a direct drive or by a suitable drive mechanism 3 as shown in figure 1. xle rotor rotates within a rotor chamber 4 having a base plate 6. this chamber is provided with a high tensile steel or other material annular guard-ring 5 surrounding the rotor. the guard-ring 5 is generally coaxial with tile axis of rotation of the rotor and will usually be of circular form but could be polygonal, e.g. squared or hexagonal. the guard-ring 5 extends within chamber 4 for at least the height of rotor 2 and usually it is required that the guard-ring 5 project some way beyond either end of the rotor. preferably, the top and bottom extremities of the guard-ring subtend an angle of at least 50 to the axis of rotation at the top and bottom extremities of the rotor. the guard-ring 5 is of conventional design and dimensions. if desired, the top end of the guard-ring can be tapered inwardly to provide further protection against escape of fragment from the rotor. in a conventional centrifuge, guard-ring 5 is fixedly mounted, e.g. by welding, to the base plate 6 of the chamber 4 and a sliding or pivotting

claims:   1. a centrifuge comprising a chamber (4) within   which    a rotor (1) is to be rotated, the   chamber    (4) being provided with a wall (5) encircling the rotor (l) when the rotor is in position and generally coaxial with the axis of rotation of the rotor (1), characterised in that the wall (5) is pivotably mounted so that it can pivot about an axis from an inoperative position permitting access to the rotor (1) to an operative position encircling the rotor.   2. a centrifuge as claimed in claim 1   characterlsed    in that the wall (5) is pivotted as a whole about an axis (10) generally perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the rotor (1).    3. a centrifuge as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that a counterbalance mechanism (20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25) is provided to assist pivotting of the wall (5).   4. a centrifuge as claimed in claim 3 characterised in that the counterbalance mechanism comprises a gas filled cylinder and piston (20) acting via a linkage (21) upon a level arm (25) mounted on the wall (5).   5. a centrifuge as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the wall (5) is provided with an integral member (30) closing the upper end of the rotor chamber (4).   6. a centrifuge as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the wall (5) is provided with a locking means to prevent pivotting of the wall (5) whilst the rotor (1) is rotating.
