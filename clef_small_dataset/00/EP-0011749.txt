<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for correctioning data EN maintains a shift register (SR4) on the transmit side, the taps of which are connected to a parity stage (PA31). The number of cells of the shift register depends on the number of taps connected to the parity level. Consequences of information bits and parity bits are encoded at Rent and transferred to the reception side. An EMP side-side slide track, (SR5) and reception-side parity levels (PA41, PA42) have the same structure as the corresponding transmit-side parts. With the help of a SYN dromregister (SR6), a majority level (M3) and a correction level (corr), erroneous information bits are corrected. The length of the syndrome register depends on the number of taps arranged on the receiving side shift registers. The taps on the syndrome register are arranged at equal intervals as shown in the transmit-side shift register, but in relation to the sliding direction site. The task of the described circuitry is the correction of bundle disturbances caused by bundle disturbances mistakes also caused in the case that disturbances in the distribution of a white roughness occur between these bun delsor. This error correction is possible because the information bits and the parity bits used for syndrome formation have a minimum distance of approximately X information bits or parity bits (X = number of information bits, which often belong to a bundle fault).
