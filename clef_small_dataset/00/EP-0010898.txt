<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a clamping device for holding  loose leaves, periodicals and the like in a binder in such a  way that a plurality of said articles so bound provides a vo­ lume which may approximate in appearance and/or feel to  a perfect bound book.  the binder comprises a cover having a front portion  (1) and a back portion (2), joined by a spine portion (4).  a  first flap (7) extends inwardly of the cover along the junc­ tion of the spine and front cover, and a second flap (7) ex­ tends inwardly of the cover along the junction of the spine  and back cover.  each flap (7) is formed with at least one  hole (10) and the flaps extend such that the spine edges of  a set of said articles to be bound can be positioned be­ tween said flaps.  clamping means for passing through the  or a hole in one flap, the or a corresponding hole in the  other flap, and corresponding holes in said set to hold the  set in place in the binder, comprises a coiled spring (11)  and two screw-threaded bolts, the pitch of the screw-­ threading of which is substantially the same as the coils of  the spring and the diameter of the heads of which is larger  than that of the holes in said flaps.
