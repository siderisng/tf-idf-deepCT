<ABSTRACT>
a method of making a refractory material, such as for  furnace use, from refractory fibres and a polymeric binder  which burns or otherwise degrades to allow the fibres to  expand from a pre-compressed state, comprises the steps of  preparing a highly dispersed aqueous suspension of the  fibres, adding 2-10% by weight of the binder in aqueous sus­ pension, adding a coagulent for the binder, forming a com­ pressed felt body by extraction of the water, such as by  suction-forming, and drying the felt body whilst maintaining  its compressed state.

<DESCRIPTION>
fibrous refractory material this invention relates to a method of making a refractory material of the kind consisting of a precompressed mass of resilient refractory fibres held in compression by a binding material which, on heating to a degradation temperature of the binder, releases the fibres so that the mass expands. refractory fibres, such as ceramic fibres, may contract on heating and therefore are not always suitable for use alone for such purposes as furnace lining or refractory joints. by pre-compression of a fibrous mass maintained by a binder which burns off or otherwise degrades so as to release the fibres at the temperature of use, the resultant expansion of the mass improves its efficiency, such as by promoting its retention in place. in the making of such a pre-compressed mass of furnace refractory fibres it is known, from united states of america patent specification no. 4 011 651, to use as a binder an aqueous dispersion or emulsion of a heat degradable organic polymer and in particular aqueous dispersions of polymer precursors, sometimes referred to as latices, in which the fibre mass is soaked and mechanically pre-compressed, dried and cured so as to retain the compression of the fibre mass. a precipitating agent such as aluminium sulphate may be used to improve the uniformity of binder distribution. it is therefore known, in a method of making a refractory material of the kind to which the invention relates, to use an aqueous preparation of a polymeric binder which is caused to deposit on the fibres. the method according to the present invention is characterised by combination of the following: a) mixing the fibres in water to form a highly dispersed aqueous suspension of the fibres, b) adding to the aqueous suspension an aqueous preparation of the polymeric binder which is in an amount of 2-10% by weight of the solid content of binder to the fibre content of the suspension, c) adding to the suspension a coagulent to cause the polymer to flocculate on the fibres, d) extracting water from the aqueous suspension through a filter so as to leave on the filter a waterbound compressed felt body of fibres, and e) drying the felt body whilst maintaining its compressed state. although it is known from different prior proposals to use steps corresponding generally but not specifically to the steps recited above, the stated combination is new and essential to produce the advantages of the invention described below. in particular, the above-mentioned united states of america patent specification no. 4 011 651 represents the nearest prior art but it does not include steps a) and d) and the binder is incorporated by soaking a fibre blanket, for example with a 4% solution of a phenolic resin. in united kingdom patent specification no. 1 019 208 there is proposed the production of a fire-resistant board material consisting mainly of water-laid felted mineral fibres, bound together by an unspecified organic binder, in a condition of elastic compression obtained through drying in a

 claims:  1. a method of making a refractory material of the kind consisting of a pre-compressed mass of resilient refractory fibres held in compression by a binding material which, on heating to a degradation temperature of the binder, releases the fibres so that the mass expands, the method comprising the use of an aqueous preparation of a polymeric binder which is caused to deposit on the fibres, characterised by combination of the following steps: :  a) mixing the fibres in water to form a highly dispersed aqueous suspension of the fibres,  b) adding to the aqueous suspension an aqueous preparation of the polymeric binder which is in an amount of 2-10% by weight of the solid content of binder to the fibre content of the suspension,  c) adding to the suspension a coagulent to cause the polymer to flocculate on the fibres,  d) extracting water from the aqueous suspension through a filter so as to leave on the filter a water-bound compressed felt body of fibres, and  e) drying the felt body whilst maintaining its compressed state.     2. the method of claim 1, characterised thereby that the length of the refractory fibres used is in the range 7mm to 30mm and the amount of fibres in the aqueous suspension is in the range 0.5% to 2.0% by weight against the weight of water.    3. the method of claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby     tha    the felt body is dried by heating at a temperature   nig;ler    than the minimum film-forming temperature of the polymeric binder and substantially lower than the temperature of use for which the refractory material is intended.    4. the method of claim 3, characterised thereby that the felt body is dried at a temperature of less than   1000c    and the polymeric binder has a minimum film-forming temperature of less than 750c.
