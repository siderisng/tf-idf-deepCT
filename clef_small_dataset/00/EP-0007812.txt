<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides derivatives of c-076, which is a  series of macrolides, in which the substituents are sugar or  saccharide groups.  the sugar groups are substituted on any  of the available hydroxy groups of the c-076 molecule by  various known procedures.  the compounds thus produced,  which have the structural formula:    in which the broken line indicates that a single or double bond  is present in the 22(23) position; r₁ is hydroxy, loweral­ kanoyloxy, or glycosyloxy, and is present only when the bor­ ken line indicates a single bond; r₂ is iso-propyl or sec-butyl;  r₃ is hydrogen, methyl, loweralkanoyl or glycosyl; and r is  hydrogen, loweralkanoyl, glycosyl,    where r₄ is hydrogen, loweralkanoyl or glycosyl; in which the  glycosyl groups are polyhydroxy (5 or 6)-membered cyclic  acetals that are optionally substituted with lower alkyl and in  which the hydroxy groups may be optionally substituted with  lower alkyl or loweralkanoyl and their mono-unsaturated  derivatives; provided that at least one of r, r₁, r₃ or r₄ must  contain a glycosyl group, and that if only r contains a glycosyl  group, that group is other than α-l-oleandrosyl or α  l-oleandrosyl-α-l-oleandrosyl, have profound anthelmintic,  insecticidal, ectoparasiticidal and acaracidal activity and  compositions for such uses are also disclosed.
