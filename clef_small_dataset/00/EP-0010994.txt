<ABSTRACT>
compounds of formula i or formula ii    where a is an electron withdrawing group and b is a secon­ dary or tertiary amino group or the group od where d is h,  aryl or an aliphatic group are made by reacting a corre­ sponding compound of formula ia or formula iia    in a solvent with a reagent selected from organic primary  and secondary amines and compounds of the formula mod  where m is an alkali metal and a and d are as defined above.   in this process the nitro group and the group b in formula i  and ia are in the 2-or 4-position and the compounds of for­ mula i, ia, ii and iia may optionally be further substituted.   preferably a primary or secondary amine is reacted with a  compound of formula ia, preferably using dimethylforma­ mide as solvent.  the process can result in the production of  novel compounds, including (1) compounds of formula iii    wherein each group a is co₂h or an alkali metal, amine or  ammonium salt thereof or the two groups a together form a  carboxylic anhydride group and b is in the 2- or 4-position  and is od, where d is hydrogen or an aliphatic group or is a  secondary or tertiary amine group, (2) compounds of for­ mula iv    where b is the group od or the group nr₂r₃ and wherein at  least one of r₁ and d or at least one of r₁, r₂ and r₃ com­ prise a solubilising group containing a primary amino, car­ boxylic, sulphonate or phosphate ester group in the form  of an alkali metal, amine or ammonium salt or a poly­ alkylene oxide group, the compounds optionally being  further substituted.
