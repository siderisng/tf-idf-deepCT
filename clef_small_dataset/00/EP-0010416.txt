<ABSTRACT>
a valveactuator which is operable alternatively by a  motor (31) and manually.  the motor (31) is coupled into the  drive-train for the actuator through a one-way coupling (35)  and a planetary gear-device (33) to enable rapid actuation of  an output-device (23).  a hand-wheel (27) is coupled to the  ring-gear drive (45) of the planetary assembly through a worm  (32) and pinion.  a position-limiting means (37) is coupled to  the output-device (23) to arrest rotation of the motor (31) at the  opposite limit-positions of the valve-element.  a torque-­ limiting sensor (67) is coupled with the ring-gear drive (45) to  sense the torque transmitted or fed back through the planet­ ary assembla to arrest the drive-motor when the motor  exceeds the said torque.
