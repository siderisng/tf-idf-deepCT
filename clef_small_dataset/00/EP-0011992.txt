<ABSTRACT>
a profile system having beams and support members is  disclosed.  such systems are known in which a joining element  (3) is used to lock a support member (2) to a beam (1).   these known systems have though required the use of some  auxiliary fastening to hold the joining element in place.  in order to obviate the necessity of using same auxiliary  fastening mechanism and to simplify the locking mechanism,  the invention provides a system which operates on the wedge  principle and which uses a joining element comprising two  wings (31,32) for extending respectively within a member (2)  and beam (1), one (31) having a projection (33) for engaging a  groove (22) in the wall (21) of one of the member and beam,  and the other (32) having an inclined surface for receiving a  wedge (4) for locking same within the other of the member  and beam.
