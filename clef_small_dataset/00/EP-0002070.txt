<ABSTRACT>
oil absorbent cellulosic material comprises a cellulosic  material and in particular bagasse, treated to reduce  its water content to below 5% by weight and to render it  substantially sugar free.  the cellulosic material so treated  is strongly oleophilic and hydrophobic and can absorb  from 15 to 27 times its own weight of oil.  one method of  preparation of the oil absorbent comprises desugaring  bagasse by lixiviation and subsequently drying it.  methods  of use of the oil absorbent comprise the separation of oil  from oil polluted water, the absorption of oil residue from  the walls of tanks and the combustion of oil soaked absorbent  to generate heat.
