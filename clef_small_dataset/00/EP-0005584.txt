<ABSTRACT>
a ball valve assembly and method of construction.  the  valve includes a one-piece ball (13) and shaft (14) in a valve  housing (18) formed of a body portion (19) and an end  portion (20), the body portion (19) being cast.  the body  portion (19) has a flow port (24) at a first end (19′) thereof and  a large opening (22) at a second end (19″) thereof, and an  elongated passageway (p) is formed in the body portion for  receipt of the shaft (14).  a relatively thick wall (28) portion is  disposed toward the body first end (19′) and a relatively thin  wall portion (29) toward the body second end (19″) around  the passageway (p).  the passageway (p) can be smooth bore  or threaded throughout its length.  a scallop (40) may be  formed in the relatively thin wall portion (29) extending  substantially perpendicular to the direction (d) of elongation  of the passageway (p), the scallop (40) being machined or  being formed during casting.  the shaft (14) is inserted  through the body portion large opening (22) and through the  scallop (40) to and through the passageway (p), and then the  ball (13) is moved so that it is in sealing relationship with  sealing means (35) associated with the body portion.  the  end portion (20) is connected to the body portion (19), and a  bushing (37) is affixed in operative association with the  passageway threads or bore for supporting and sealing the  shaft (14).  the interfaces between the body portion (19) and  the end portion (20), and between the bushing (37) and the  body portion (19) may be welded where a poisonous fluid or  the like is to be valved by the assembly.
