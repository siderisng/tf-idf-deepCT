<ABSTRACT>
a heat shield arrangement for strip material employs  insulating panels (20, 22, 24) that include an upper series  (20) displaceable upwardly by power actuation means (48)  to avoid damage by buckled or lifting material.  protective  elements (40) projecting below the upper panels (20)  are associated with sensing means (51, 51a) to actuate  the raising of the upper panels (20) and are on mountings  (42) able to have a limited displacement before the  raising of the upper panels (20) is actuated.  the power  actuation means (48) act on said mountings (42) to  determine the minimum force from the material that  causes raising of said panels (20).  to lead in deformed  stock there is an increased height entry region comprising  a reinforced upper structure, possibly followed by upper  and lower insulating panels at decreasing heights from  each other to merge into a main region of limited height.   the panels may have heating means to give the strip a  more uniform transverse temperature profile.
