<ABSTRACT>
a metal/ceramic abradable seal structure (10,18) of the  type used in aircraft turbine engines is improved by using a  metal substrate (10) which is able to deform during cooling  from the brazing temperature and is then rendered rigid after  the cool down by applying reinforcements (20,22) to the subs­ trate (10).  by this method internal stress in the material is  relieved which would otherwise occur, if an initially rigid sub­ strate was used.
