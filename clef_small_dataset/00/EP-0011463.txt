<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a quantitiative method and  composition for precipitating fibrin monomers from plasma  in the presence of fibrinogen, with only a small amount, if  any, of fibrinogen being precipitated.  a buffered precipitat­ ing agent is provided having a ph in the range of 6. 5 ± 0. 5,  the buffer being one having a pka in the range of 6 to 7 and  protamine sulfate at a level of 0. 025 to 0. 2% by weight.  suit­ able buffers are 2-(n-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid,  sodium phosphate, histidine, maleic acid and imidazole.   analysis of the amount of fibrin present can be made by  analyzing for protein using preferably a basic urea solution  containing sodium hydroxide and measuring the absorbance  of 282 nanometers.
