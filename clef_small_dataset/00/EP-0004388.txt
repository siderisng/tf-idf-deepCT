<ABSTRACT>
the application relates to a rolling and rocking board for playing, for training, in particular in sport types where mastery of balance is important, and for therapeutic purposes.  the rolling and rocking board consists of a cylindrical member (2) and an elongate board (1) which has, arranged on the underside parallel to the longitudinal axis, at least one guide strip (5) and, at the ends, movement-limiting strips (6) for the cylindrical member (2).  the guide strips (5) can be arranged asymmetrically in relation to the central longitudinal axis and the limiting strips (6) offset from the edge.  the cylindrical member (2) can have circumferential grooves corresponding to the dimensions of the guide strips (5) and to their distance from one another.  <image>
