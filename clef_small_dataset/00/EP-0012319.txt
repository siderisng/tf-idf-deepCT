<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for soldering components with flat terminal contacts on printed circuit boards. While so far the required soldering residue was supplied from above by means of a solder frame or by means of thermal plates or radiators and, for further, to produced components, which were squeezed with connection pins in the circuit board and soldered on the back by means of a solder bath, the invention proposes, even building elements Te with flat connection contacts with the aid of the solder bath attacking on the back of the printed circuit board. For this purpose, the printed circuit boards (1) are provided in the region of the surface gene connection contacts with via-contacted holes (4) and the soldering of the existing solder layers on the connecting points of the components (10) and the circuit board required heat is supplied from the opposite side of the printed circuit board via the via-contacted holes by liquid solder. The invention further relates to a template for performing this Ver movement, which has pressure elements (21a-d) where the connection contacts of the components are located.
