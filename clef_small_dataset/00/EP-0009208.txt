<ABSTRACT>
a molded article simulating the appearance of natural  plantation crepe rubber and a method for producing this  article.  styrene/butadiene linear or radial block copolymer  having a polymerized styrene content of the range of about  20 to about 50 weight percent of the total block copolymer  and resinous polymer of vinylsubstituted aromatic com­ pound in the range of about 10 to about 60 parts resinous  polymer per 100 parts block copolymer are blended with a  sufficient amount of polarizing agent to achieve rapid heat­ ing through response to microwave treatment.  the compo­ sition is melted, molded against a surface mirroring the ap­ pearance of plantation crepe rubber, and removed from  the mold as an article simulating plantation crepe rubber.   in an embodiment of the invention with chemical blowing  agent incorporated into the molding composition, an  amount of the molding composition is introduced with the  mold that upon activation of the blowing agent during the  molding operation produces a molded article having a nor­ mally dense skin with a microporous interior.
