<ABSTRACT>
a video entertainment system by which human viewers  conduct simulated voice conversations with screen actors in a  prerecorded branching movie shown on a television screen  (27).  a voice-recognition unit (38) recognizes a few words  spoken by a viewer at branch points in the movie.  a different  set of words may be used at each branch point.  a hand-held  unit (41) displays prompting messages to inform each viewer  of the words that can be recognized at each branch point.  a  scheduling unit (35) assembles cueing commands specifying  which video frames, cartoon frames, messages, and audio  portions are to be presented at which instant of time.  a cueing  unit (12) executes these commands by generating precisely  med video and audio signals, so that a motion picture with  lip-synchronized sound is presented to the viewer who vocÂ­ ally influences the course of the movie.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field of the invention this invention relates to video systems, voice-recognition devices. branching movies, and picture/sound synchronization. background of the invention while watching a prior-art sound movie. a viewer often experiences a vicarious sense of involvement. but the viewer cannot actively participate in the movie, because the viewer cannot talk with the screen actors and have them reply responsively. applying prior-art voice-recognition techniques to control prior-art branching movices would not provide a natural conversational dialog because of the following problem: if the number of words uhich a viewer of any age and sex can speak and be unerstood by the apparatus is sufficiently large to permit a natural conversation, then prior-art voite-recognition techniques are unreliable. conversely, if the number of words is restricted to only a few words td make voice recognition reliable. then natural conversation would not result. it is also necessary for the picture to be responsive to a viewer's voice and be synchronized with the spoken reply. these problems are not addressed in the prior art. an example of m prior-art branching movie is shown in u.s. patent 3,960,38 itled "light ray gun and target changing projectors. this system uses a pair of film projectors which present two alternatives (hit or missy at each branch point. an example of a prior-art device for interactive voice dialog is shown in u.s. patent 4,016,540. this device does not present a motion picture. an example of a prior-art video editing system is shown in u.s. patent 9, 72l,757. this system displays a sequence of video excerpts specified by a control program of stored videodisc addresses which comprise a sequential (not branching) movie. to change this sequence the editor alters the program. in the present invention the viewer does not alter the program. summary of the invention this invention is a video entertainment system by which one or more human viewers influence the course of a prerecorded movie and conduct a simulated two-way voice conversation with screen actors in the movie. viewers talk to the screen actors and the actors talk back and talk responsively. the system thus provides an illusion of individualized and active participation in the movie as if each viewer were a participant in a real-life drama. to simplify performing of voice-recognition on the voices of different viewers. regardless of age and sex. while at the same time using a large vocabulary of computer-recognizable words, the words to be recognized at each branch point in the movie are restricted to two or a few words such as 'yes" and "attacks. the words which a viewer may use at each branch point will often be different from words used at other branch points. the apparatus informs the viewers of what words they can use by displaying prompting messages on a hand-held display device and/or with prompting-words spoken by a screen actor. the display device also contains a microphone into which a viewer speaks a selected word at each branch point. to permit a viewer to ask questions or
