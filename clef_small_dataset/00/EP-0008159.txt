<ABSTRACT>
an insert type and milling cutter and cutting insert (b)  for the same which facilitates metal removal.  each insert  (b) has a cutting edge (92) which is defined by the inter­ section of a cutting face and a land area.  the cutting face  is disposed so as to have a neutral rake angle and the cut­ ting edge (92) itself lies in a single plane but has a general­ ly sinusoidal configuration in a direction normal to the cut­ ting face.  the milling cutter includes a plurality of insert  locating grooves (18) which locate the inserts (b) in a  manner such that the cutting edges (92) form straight  helixes over at least a portion of the cutter length.  the in­ serts (b) may be reasonably retained in the locating grooves  (18) to facilitate ease of removal for repair or replacement  purposes.
