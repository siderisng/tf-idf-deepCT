<ABSTRACT>
A evaporative humidifier has a water preferred case (1) on which one, a detection filter (5) carrying filter carrier (3) is. This filter carrier has a removable additive plate (9) on which all electric parts are mounted, namely a motor (10) with the pump (11) reaching in the water reservoir (1) and arranged on its upper side fan blade (16), and An installation housing (17). A connecting hose (15) connects the pump (11) with the evaporation filter (5). The additional plate (9) at its lower side is a guide piece (18) which is engaged with a guide (20) attached to the water in the mill (1). Furthermin, the additional plate (9) has a first coupling piece (21) for the connecting hose (15). When inserting the FÃ¼h tuber (18) in the guide (20), the first coupling piece (21) is automatically coupled to a second clutch piece (25) held on the filter plate (3).
