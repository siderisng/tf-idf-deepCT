<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to hip nails and  methods for using them in the fixation of fractures about  the upper end (25) of the femur.  prior art hip nails have  been ineffective to consistently effect a rigid fixation suffi­ cent to permit the patient to bear full body weight on  the injured leg at an early stage of healing, without sub­ stantial pain, and without interfering with healing of the  fracture.  the present invention overcomes these difficul­ ties by providing an improved hip nail and related me­ thod for its use for achieving a rigid fixation of a fracture  of the upper femur.  the hip nail includes an elongated  nail portion (11), having a far end and a near end, along  with a plate portion (17) coupled to the near end of the  nail (11).  the nail portion (11) is inserted into an elongat­ ed hole (13) extending from the laterial femoral cortex  (15) across the fracture site to the interior of the femoral  head (25), and an enlarged cavity (27) is formed at the  far end of the hole for receiving a special cement material  (29), which, when hardened, is pripped by the far end of  the nail.  the plate portion (17) is then attached to the  femoral shaft by screws (45) and a flexible stainless steel  band (41), to effect a rigid fixation of the fracture.
