<ABSTRACT>
a high-frequency electrodeless discharge device is oper­ ated by radio-frequency energy generated by an oscillator  operating in class e mode.  by proper selection of the oscil­ lator circuit components, a load-network capacitor can be  eliminated along with an inductor which is normally required  to pass direct current to the transistor switch portion of the  oscillator.  the elimination of these elements permits the oscil­ lator to be packaged in compact fashion.  the discharge device  incorporates a looped core of high permeability material  which forms a part of the tuned circuit output portion of the  oscillator and the radio frequency energy electromagnetic  fields passed through and about the core and within the  envelope of the device excite a discharge-sustaining medium  to generate plasma which is converted to visible radiations.  a  feed-back signal winding is also wrapped about the looped  core and electrically connects to the transistor switch portion  of the oscillator in order to provide feedback oscillatory  energy for the class e oscillator.
