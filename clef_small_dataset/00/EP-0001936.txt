<ABSTRACT>
acetaldehyde is produced by reacting methanol with  hydrogen and carbon monoxide at elevated temperature and  pressure in the presence of a catalyst comprising cobalt, an  iodide or a bromide and one of the elements arsenic,  antimony or bismuth, either in the form of the free element  or a compound thereof, and in the additional presence of one  or more of the following additives:   (i) an inert liquid such as chlorobenzene, decanoic acid, a  polydimethylsiloxane fluid or a methyl phenyl silicone fluid,   (ii) an acid and/or an acid derivative such as acetic acid,  acetic anhydride, propionic acid, phenylacetic acid, benzoic  acid, methyl acetate or butyl acetate.    (iii) an oxygen-containing organic compound such as  1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, di-n-propylether, diphenylether  acetone, acetaldehyde, n-propanol or n-butanol.    (iv) a non-polar solvent such as an alkane, benzene or an  alkyl-substituted benzene.  the presence of the additive suppresses by-product  formation and thereby improves the yield and selectivity to  acetaldehyde.
