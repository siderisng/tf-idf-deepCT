<ABSTRACT>
spent hydrofining catalysts (e. g.  comprising co and  mo supported on alumina) are regenerated by contact with  an aqueous solution of a heteropoly acid of general for­ mula hx(ym₁₂o₄₀) where y is at least one element selected  from phosphorus, silicon, titanium, germanium, arsenic,  zirconium, thorium and cerium; m is at least one of mo, w,  nb, and ta, x is 3 when y is pentavalent and 4 when y is  tetravalent.  thereafter, the catalyst is calcined to remove  coke.  the heteropoly acid removes from the spent catalyst  metals (particularly v, ni and co) which are deposited dur­ ing hydrofining and reduce its efficacy, without substan­ tially affecting the support.  the heteropoly acid solution  may contain up to 50 wt.  % (based on the heteropoly acid)  of h₂o₂ to enhance the removal of vanadium.  the spent  catalyst may be pre-sulfided before contact with the  heteropoly acid to enhance the removal of vanadium.

<DESCRIPTION>
"process for regenerating spent hydrofixing catalysts" the present invention relates to a process for regenerating spent catalysts used in hydrofining operations, and more particularly, to a process for the regeneration of spent catalysts employed in hydro desuifurization and hydrodenitrogenation by a process which includes treatment with a heteropoly acid. in this specification, the periodic classification of the elements is that devised by the fisher scientific company, catalogue no. 5-702-10 appearing in "the condensed chemical dictionary". edited by a. & e. rose (reinhold), 7th edition. the abbreviation "hdst' represents hydrodesulfurization, and "go-fining" is a trade name for thc hydrofining of heavier feedstocks such as gas oils. as is well-known, hydrodesulfurization of, e.g., petroleum fractions, is usually carried out employing an alumina catalyst support impregnated with group vib and viii metals such as molybdenum and cobalt. while such catalysts are extremely useful in reducing sulfur content, the effectiveness of these catalysts is diminished during the course of processing as a result of two problems. first, carboy residues (coke) deposit on the surface of the catalyst, thereby reducing the effective surface area and pore size for catalytic activity. second, heavy metals in the feedstock, such as nickel, and more importantly, vanadium, tend to poison the catalyst, again resulting in reduced catalytic activity. during the course of processing, the temperature is generally increased at a predetermined rate in order to compensate for the coking and poisoning effects. however, as the temperature is increased, a greater percentage of feedstock is cracked, thereby resulting in a decrease of desirable product. further, the increase in processing temperature results in an increase in the deposition rate of carbon residues. regeneration of spent catalysts has been th± subject of much investigation and, consequently, a number of approaches for regenerating hydrodesulfurization catalysts have been developed. in particular, acidic media, such as mineral acids, anhydrous hf, oxalic acid and other carboxylic acids and acidified amine solutions, and oxidizing media, such as hydrogen peroxide, have been employed. however, such methods either (1) result in removal of unacceptable amounts of catalytically active metals, e.g., cobalt and molybdcnuin, as well as some solubilization of the support material, e.g., alumina, or (2) do not regenerate a sufficiently highly degree of catalytic activity, so that catalytic activity of te regenerated catalyst is considerably inferior to that of fresh catalyst. a sulfurous atmosphera at a pressure of at least 0.10 atmospheres and at a temperature of between 400 and 825 c has also been employed to regenerate the spent metal catalyst; see u.s. patent 4,014,815, issued march 29, 1977. the process is employed for a time sufficient for the selective formation of sulfides of carbon and vanadium, which sulfides are characterized by having a high volatility and solubility in the sulfurous atmosphere and are selectively removed from the catalyst at the temperature of the press. while the disclosed process is useful in regeneration of spent catalysts, it requires and/or involves highly corrosive conditions and formation of very specific volatile sulfide species. the temperatures required for vanadium removal
