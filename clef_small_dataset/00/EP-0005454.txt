<ABSTRACT>
In a control valve devices (1, 23) operated via control valve devices (1, 23), on the brake linkage, an arbitrarily actuated parking brake can act, an undesirable addition of the clamping forces of both brake types is to be prevented. For this purpose, a switching device (21) is provided which monitors the pressure medium supercharging of the brake cylinder (9) and which is operated by the reaction force on a bearing point (17) of a lever (13) belonging to the parking brake, wherein the switching threshold of the switching device (21) overcoming Reaction force of a particular appropriate, which ensures that the operating brake (9) is released only at a time, in which on the one hand the parking brake already has a certain braking force and on the other hand the forcibly short-term summing of the parking brake force to the operational brake force below a leading load of the brake linkage remains.
