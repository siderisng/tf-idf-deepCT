<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a method of regulating the  growth of leguminous plants which comprises applying  to the plant locus a plant growth regulating effective amount  of a compound having the general formula    wherein x is selected from the group consisting of oxygen,  sulfur and -nh; r is hydrogen, halogen or lower alkyl; r₁ is  selected from the group consisting of    and cn;   r₂ is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower  alkyl and agriculturally acceptable cations; r₃ and r₄ are  independently selected from the group consisting of hydro­ gen and lower alkyl; and n is an integer from 1 to 3, with the  proviso that when r₁ is    n cannot be 2.  this invention also relates to a plant growth regulat­ ing composition which comprises from about 5 to about  95 parts by weight of a compound having the above general  formula, the remaining parts being comprised of one or  more suitable adjuvants, carriers and/or diluents.

<DESCRIPTION>
substituted benzazolylthioalkanoic acids as plant growth regulants this invention relates to the use of certain 2-benzothiazolylthioalkanoic acids, 2-benzoxazolylthioalkanoic acids and 2-benzimidazolylthioalkanoic acids and derivatives thereof to regulate the growth of leguminous plants. more specifically, this invention relates to a method of regulating the growth of leguminous plants which comprises applying to the plant locus a plant growth regulating effective amount of a compound characterized in that the said compound has the general formula emi1.1 wherein x is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and -nh; r is hydrogen, halogen or lower alkyl; r1 is selected from the group consisting of emi1.2 r2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl and agriculturally acceptable cations; r3 and r4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl; and n is an integer from 1 to 3, with the proviso that when r1 is emi1.3 n cannot be 2. the invention also provides a plant growth regulating composition which comprises from about 5 to about 95 parts by weight of a compound, the remaining parts being comprised of one or more suitable adjuvants, carriers and/or diluents, characterized in that said compound has the general formula emi2.1 wherein x is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur and -nh; r is hydrogen, halogen or lower alkyl; r1 is selected from the group consisting of emi2.2 r2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl and agriculturally acceptable cations; r3 and r4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl; and n is an integer from 1 to 3, with the proviso that when r7 is emi2.3 n cannot be 21. preferred are those compounds in which r is hydrogen or chloro, especially hydrogen. r2 is preferably methyl or ethyl and r3 is preferably hydrogen. as used herein, the term "lower alkyl" means those alkyl groups, branched as well as unbranched, having up to 5 carbon atoms. the term "agriculturally acceptable cations" is understood to mean those cations normally used to form the salt of the free acid and include, but are not limited to, alkali metal, alkaline earth, ammonium and substituted ammonium cat ions. illustrative of the plant growth regulating compounds of the present invention are 2-benzothiazolylthioacetic acid; 5-chloro-2-benzothiazolylthioacetic acid; 2-benzoxazolylthioacetic acid; 2-benzimidazolylthioacetic acid; ethyl 2-benzothiazolylthioacetate; ethyl 2-benzimidazolylthioacetate; ethyl 2-benzoxazolylthioacetate; methyl 2-benzothiazolylthioacetate; methyl 2 -benzoxazolylthioacetate; methyl 2-benzimidazolylthioacetate; 2-benzothiazolylthioacetamide; 5-chloro-2-benzothiazolylthioacetamide; 2 benz oxaz olylt hioacet amid e; 5-chloro-n-methyl-2-benzothiazolylthioacetamide; n-methyl-2-benzimidazolylthioacetamide; 2-benzoxazolylthioacetonitrile; 2-benzothiazolylthioacetonitrile; 2-benzimidazolylthioacet6nitrlle; 2-benzothiazolylthiobutyronitrile; 2-benzoxazolylthiobutyronitrile; 2-benzimidazolylthiobutyronitrile; and 5-chloro-2-benzothiazolylthiobutyronitrile. in accordance with the novel aspects of the present invention, the compounds of the foregoing formula are effective plant growth regulants, especially in the regulation of leguminous plants. the term "plant regulant" or "plant growth regulant", as employed in this application, connotes a material which serves to modify the normal sequential development of a treated plant to agricultural maturity. such modification may result from the effect of material on the physiological processes of the plant or from the effect of said material on
