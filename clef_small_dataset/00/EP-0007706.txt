<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector for use in making tap connections  to conductors, comprises a two part (1, 2) housing carrying  two contact member arrangements (8, 9, 12) and a bolt (3) by  which the housing parts (1, 2) can be urged together thereby  to close the contact arrangements (8, 9, 12) onto a suitably  positioned conductor and tap wire, the contact arrangements  (8, 9, 12) being such that connection can be made to the  conductor before it is necessary to position the tap wire for  connection.
