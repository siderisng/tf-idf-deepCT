<ABSTRACT>
a label machine for forming individual labels (36)  from an endless tape strip (31).  the machine includes a  novel label removal device (15) which uses compressed  air to insure removal of each label to a collection station  (16) after it is cut from the endless strip, thereby pre足 venting hang-up of labels at the machine's cutter as足 sembly (26).  the machine also includes a novel tape  feed mechanism that provides accurate label length con足 trol, thereby preventing waste of tape.  these mechanisms  are preferably used in combination with a printer head,  the novel tape feed and label removal mechanisms co-足 operating to prevent printing errors between leading and  trailing labels cut from the endless tape strip.
