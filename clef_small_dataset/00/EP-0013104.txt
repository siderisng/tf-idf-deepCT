<ABSTRACT>
for locating the distance of a fault on a power supply line  from a substation in an electricity reticulation system, primar­ ily conversion means, (pr) are used, adapted to provide dc  signals whose magnitudes are proportional to the ac values  of current and voltage related to the fault and computing (d)  means adapted to compute a quotient of those dc signals.   the computing means also is adapted to apply an earth fault  compensation factor and a line angle correction factor to the  dc quotient and to thus provide a measure of the distance to  the fault.  a sample-and-hold means (s-h) is included, adapted  to relay a value of the quotient to provide a measure of dis­ tance to fault only after a predetermined time during which  transient effects may subside to some extent.  an analogue to  digital convertor (a-d) relays the signal to a printer (p) to  provide a record of fault history.  this locator is thus adapted  to solve the problem of excessive technical complexity of  certain existing apparatuses and so provide a less costly  device which can be installed in larger numbers in a reticula­ tion system for more comprehensive monitoring.

<DESCRIPTION>
fault distei ce locator this invention lies in the field of apparatus for locating the distance of a fault on a power supply line, for example from a substation, in the context, for example, of electricity power reticulation systems. the basic principle of fault distance location comprises measurement of the voltage and current magnitudes, obtaining a quotient of the voltage over the current to give impedance and with a known impedance-per-unit-distance of a transmission line the distance to the fault from a measuring position -can in principle be computed. the practical application of this simple principle in power transmission lines is subject to difficulties arising, for example, due to phase angle effects, earth fault impedance.eff9cts in the case of earth faults and transient effects. certain fault locators known to applicant are designed to attempt to detect, measure and compensate for these effects; these become very complex and as a result their main limi tation is that they are very costly. an example is a schlumberger type dcds 1000 fault locator, and a schlumberger circuit can be seen described in u.k. patent 1 415 695. costliness is e serious disadvantage because it dictates restricted application of the devices and so limited usefulness in a reticulation system. in other fault distance locaters the device inherently is able to provide a record only of the most recent fault (i.e. no memory), the record of previous faults to which the device responded being over-ridden by the latest fault information, so that the device is of limited usefulness when installed in unmanned substations, for example, in the case of overhead power transmission lines one or more of the phases of a given line can be subject to numerous faults over a period of time and accordingly information as to fault history can be a valuable aid in diagnosing the cause of the fault. u.k. patent 1 355 089, granted to siemens akt., describes analogue conversion of ac current and voltage signals derived from the protected lines to proportional dc voltages, however, these,dc voltages are then immediately converted to frequencies by voltage-frequency converters after which the quotient is obtained digitally and further complex computations made to derive a measure of fault distance, a line fault distance locator in accordance with this invention,having conversion means adapted to provide dc signals whose magnitudes are proportional to ac values of current and voltage related to the fault and computing means, is characterised in that the computing means is adapted to compute a quotient of the do signals by dividing the dc signal proportional to the voltage related to the fault by the dc signal proportional to the current related to the fault, to apply an earth fault com pensetion factor,a line angle correction factor and an earth fault compensation factor in the case of an earth fault, and to provide a measure of the distance to the fault from a measuring position. this technique has inherent in it e considerable simplification as compared with the devices of art, allowing
