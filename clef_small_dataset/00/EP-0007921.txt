<ABSTRACT>
the underwater roller rakes (26) having a tower (3, 5, 17, 18, 19) relate to an apparatus which consists of a "bridge", which is carried by a circular ship, hangs on cables, is suspended above the sea bed and has a tower-like structure, and roller rakes (26) mechanically rotating at the sea bed and having hollow shafts in order to lift manganese nodules over a large clearing width and to convey them into the hollow shafts of the rake rollers (26) and into the telescopic perpendicular conveying pipe.  the stability of the "tower" with conveying pipeline arranged in the interior of the same and the stability of the telescopic main conveying pipeline (2) located above it is substantially improved or enhanced by stabilising planes by means of the supporting steel cables coming from the circular ship.  horizontally acting thrust units (35) enable the roller rakes to overcome obstacles on the sea bed and maintain the right-angled position necessary for the direction of advance or clearing.  <image>
