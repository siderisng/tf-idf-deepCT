<ABSTRACT>
a unitary tubular axe (12) is formed to include an end  (18) having a support section (22) of a completely solid  cross section located between a generally vertical kingpin  bore (24) and a tubular intermediate portion (16) of the  axle.  both ends (18) of the tube are formed with such an  end construction to provide a unitary front axle for both  wheels.  forming proceeds by initially reducing the size of  the outer tube diameter at an end thereof while maintain足 ing roundness.  axial forging of the tube end preferably by  a closed die having a semispherical closed end then pro足 vides an axle end having a solid cross section and a distal  semispherical shape.  subsequent axial forging of the so足 lid tube end by another closed die then provides upper  and lower projections (26, 28) in which upwardly and  downwardly facing holes are then forged to increase the  width thereof while leaving a web between inner ends of  the holes.  a final boring operation through the upper and  lower projections along the respective holes thereof and  through the web then provides the kingpin bore which is  located on the opposite side of the solid support section  from the intermediate tubular portion of the axle.  bending  of the axle end provides an upwardly extending wing sec足 tion (20) from which the solid support section projects  generally horizontally.
