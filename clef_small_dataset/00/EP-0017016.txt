<ABSTRACT>
a flexible arm particularly a robot arm comprising a  plurality of elements engaging each other and being  arranged in a series, said elements being interconnected via  cables and if desired power transferring actuating means.   the purpose of the invention is to provide an arm having  very good rigidity in the bending plane of the element and a  high torsional resistance together with lower manufacturing  costs as compared to conventional robot arms.  this has  been achieved thereby that each element (11) is designed  with arched opposed single- or double-curved segments (8,  9) which with their curved contact surfaces (5) are located to  engage the contact surface of the nearest adjacent seg­ ment, whereby the elements (11) are arranged when actu­ ated by said power generating and/or power transferring  means (14) to make a rolling motion relative to each other.
