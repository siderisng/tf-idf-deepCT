<ABSTRACT>
a method of treating the surface of substrates used  in liquid crystal display cells so that the surface forces  the liquid crystal director to be aligned uniformly over  the entire surface and parallel to the substrate surface.   the method includes the step of forming a plasman beam  containing oxygen free-radicals, inert gas free-radicals  such as argon, neon and helium, and free radicals of a  compound containing the element to be deposited, for  example, silicon, tin, indium, etc.  preferably a volatile  organo-silicon or an organo-tin compound is used to  supply the silicon or tin.  the plasma beam is then direct­ ed at the substrate surface at an angle, preferably of  about 30°, for a time sufficient to deposit a film.  the  liquid crystal display cell utilizing a substrate formed in  this manner has a high contrast ratio as well as a sharp  threshold in its electro-optical characteristics.
