<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for making ice blocks comprising a hollow  body with downwardly projecting parts (5) through which  refrigerating fluid and heating fluid are circulated separately.  a tray (6) surrounds the projecting parts (5) when it is in  its uppermost position.  this tray (6) supported by a mechanism  (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), is movable between the uppermost and  a lowermost postion.  a water supply line (19) comprising a  cock (20) is disposed above said tray (6).  when ice has formed on the projecting parts (5), an electric  circuit is closed and the cock (20) opens for some time.   under the influence of the added water, the tray (6) moves to  the lowermost position where water flows away, out of the  tray (6), after which the tray (6) is raised back to its uppermost  position by a counter weight (13).
