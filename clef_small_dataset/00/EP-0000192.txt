<ABSTRACT>
1.  heat recovery unit for a washing installation (14) having at least one washing chamber (16, 18; 140, 16, 18; 140, 18) and an after-washing chamber (20) in which the material (168) cleaned in the washing chamber (16, 18; 140, 16, 18; 140, 18) is after-washed rhythmically in hot water, comprising a compressor (50) for an operating medium, a liquefier (52), through the input end of which flows the operating medium which has been compressed and heated in the compressor (50) and the secondary end of which is supplied with fresh water, at a lower temperature than the boiling temperature of the operating medium, to be heated for the production of the hot water, a first throttle element (60) fitted in the flow path of the operating medium beyond the liquefier (52) for expanding and reducing the temperature of the operating medium, an evaporator (62) fitted in the flow path of the operating medium with its input end between the first throttle element (60) and the liquefier (52) and into the secondary end of which the mixture of steam and hot air coming from the washing installation (14) is admitted to heat it, an instantaneous water heater (166) for the heated fresh water and a storage vessel (226), characterised by the fact that the flow of the fresh water to be heated can be regulated in conformity with the pressure of the operating medium at the inlet of the liquefier (52), that the storage vessel (226) is connected directly to the secondary end of the liquefier (52), that the instantaneous water heater (166) is fitted between the storage vessel (226) and the after-washing chamber (20) and is regulated in conformity with its output temperature and that, depending upon a minimum water level in the storage vessel (226), fresh water can be fed to the storage vessel (226) and/or to the conduit running from it to the after-washing chamber (20).
