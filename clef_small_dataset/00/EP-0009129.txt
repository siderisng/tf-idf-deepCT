<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a device for the temperature-controlled heating of probes, especially of measured value receivers for transcutaneous oxygen determination, consisting of a probe, e. g.  a receiver with measurement electrodes or the like, as well as an associated operating unit.  probes which are heated, for the measurement, to a temperature higher than the ambient temperature in general require not only the heating device but also separate temperature sensors with which a regulating quantity for the supply circuit in the operating unit (25) is generated.  according to the invention, a measured value receiver (1) includes as probe a resistance path (23) with a defined, temperature-dependent electrical resistance (36), which at the same time fulfils the function of a heating and of a temperature sensor, in the operating unit (25) the value (r theta ) of the temperature-dependent resistance (36) of the resistance path (23) is compared with the value (rs) of a predeterminable resistance (37) and the operating unit (25) gives a variable heating current, with which the temperature of the resistance path (23) and thus the value (r theta ) of the temperature-dependent resistance (36) is matched to the predetermined target value (rs).  accordingly, a heating and regulation in the body temperature range by means of a direct current measurement bridge is possible.  <image>
