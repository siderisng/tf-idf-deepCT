<ABSTRACT>
the problem of crystallization of organic photoconduc­ tive compounds in insulating binder-containing layers, which  may impair the capability of those layers to produce high-­ resolution images, is overcome by using as the photoconduc­ tor a mixture comprising at least two compounds of the for­ mula:    wherein r is an alkyl, substituted alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or substi­ tuted aryl group;   each of x, x′, y, and y′, which may be the same or differ­ ent is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkoxy, substituted  alkoxy, hydroxyl, nitro or halogen;   each of a and b, which may be the same or different, is  hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy,  hydroxyl, halogen, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, cycloal­ kyl having four to ten carbon atoms and cycloalkenyl having  four to eight carbon atoms; or   a and b taken together represent atoms which form with  the carbon to which they are attached a substituted or unsub­ stituted carbocyclic ring having from 4 to 10 atoms, any alkyl,  substituted alkyl, alkoxy or substituted alkoxy substituent  having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and any aryl or substituted  aryl group being an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl,  naphthyl or anthryl group, any substituent in a substituted  aryl group being an amino, alkylamino, or dialkylamino group  or a substituent as defined for x, x′, y and y′.

<DESCRIPTION>
photoconductive layers and elements and processes for using them this invention provides novel photoconductive layers containing mixtures of certain organic photoconductors and novel photoconductive elements containing such layers. the use of photoconductive elements in electrophotographic processes is well known. such elements generally comprise a conductive support bearing a photo conductive layer. the photoconductive layer generally comprises a photoconductive material dispersed in an electrically insulating binder. among the materials which have been described as useful organic photo conductive materials are tri-substituted methanes such as disclosed in u.s. patent 3,820,989 by rule and triarylmethane leuco bases such as disclosed in u.s. patent 3,542,547 by wilson. photoconductive layers comprising the organic photoconductive materials disclosed in the aforementioned patents are capable of producing high resolution images at suitable exposures. however, after a period of storage or if the. element was prepared using elevated drying temperatures, elements which contain a photo conductive layer having only one photoconductor often will not perform well. such poor electrophotographic performance is apparently due to the tendency of the organic photoconductor to migrate to the surface of the layer and crystallize out in a snake-like pattern. such crystallization has been called the "snake" defect or "snake" problem. it impairs the capability of the photoconductive layer for producing high resolution images. we have now discovered that this crystallization, or "snake", problem can be overcome by producing an electrophotographic layer comprising an electrically insulating binder and organic photoconductive material which contains a crystallization inhibiting mixture of at least two organic photoconductors of the formula: emi2.1 <tb> formula <sep> i <sep> yrx <tb> <sep> rpj <sep> y' <sep> e <tb> <sep> n-r <sep> nw <tb> wherein r is an alkyl, substituted alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or substituted aryl group; each of x, x', y and yl, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, hydroxyl, nitro or halogen; and each of a and b, which may be the same or differen is of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, hydroxyl, halogen, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, cycloalkyl having four. to ten carbon atoms and cycloalkenyl having four to eight carbon atoms; or a and b taken together represent atoms which form with the carbon atom to which they are attached a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic ring having from 4 to. 10 carbon atoms; any alkyl substituted alkyl, alkoxy or substituted alkoxy substituent having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and any aryl or substituted aryl group being an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, naphthyl or anthryl group, any substituent in a substituted aryl group being an amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group or a substituent as defined for x, x', y and y'. the photoconductive elements of this invention contain one or more of such photo conductive layers on a conductive support. formula i, representing the class of organic photoconductors useful in the present invention, includes certain of the organic photoconductive materials disclosed in aforementioned u.s. patent 3,542,547 and u.s. patent 3,820,989. photoconductive elements comprising photoconductive layers of the
