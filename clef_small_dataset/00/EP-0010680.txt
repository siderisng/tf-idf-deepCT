<ABSTRACT>
1.  machine for the manufacture of cup-like containers from paper or the like, having at least one tapered mandrel (2) as carrier for a cup shell (7) projecting beyond the mandrel at its thicker end, a device for forming a support for the rim (6) of the cup shell (7) projecting beyond the mandrel, which is formed by an axially displaceable tapered support member (5) situated coaxially opposite the thicker end of the mandrel, and also a device (28) for beading the rim (6) of the cup shell (7) projecting beyond the mandrel (2), characterised in that the tapered support member (5) is displaceable between a first position remote from the rim (6) of the cup shell (7) and a second position in which, abutting against the mandrel (2), it forms a smooth continuation of the mandrel surface, and in that an axially displaceable beading ring (28) is provided, which surrounds the tapered support member (5) and which comprises several radially movably mounted segments.
