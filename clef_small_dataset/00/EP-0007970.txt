<ABSTRACT>
1.  a pressure accumulator including a housing which consists of an upper and a lower shell (1) and has its inner chamber separated into a gas and a liquid compartment by means of an elastic partition wall (7), wherein the upper shell (2) is slid into the cylindrical opening of the lower shell (1) until it abuts a stop and the edge of the cylindrical opening of the lower shell is chipless formed to fit about the edge (5) of the upper shell (2), said edge being formed by a radially outwardly extending circumferential projection (12) of approximately rectangular cross-section, characterized in that a radially inwardly open annular groove (3) is formed in the inner wall of the lower shell (1) in the area of the opening prior to its deformation, with the internal diameter of the lower shell (1) on the sideof the annular groove (3) remote from the opening being smaller than, and on the side of the annular groove (3) close to the opening being greater than, the external diameter of the projection (12) of the upper shell (2), so that the upper shell (2) is slidable into the lower shell (1) until the one lateral surface (14) of the projection (12) abuts the lateral wall (15) of the annular groove (3), which wall is remote from the opening of the lower shell, and with, prior to the assembly of the housing, the cross-section of the annular groove (3) being so formed that it is able to conform to the cross-section of the projection (12) as a result of the pressure acting on the outer circumference of the lower shell (1) in the area of the annular groove (3) with a component directed radially inwardly and a component directed axially towards the opening of the lower shell, and in that, after the deformation, the annular groove (3) engages the projection (12).
