<ABSTRACT>
the slippery road (ice or aqua planing) alarming device consists of a light source which transmits light of a specific wavelength and a receiver which receives the light transmitted back from the road surface.  transmitter and receiver are installed above the carriageway surface, e. g.  on a motor vehicle.  incorporated in the transmitted light beam are filters whose translucency is selected in such a way that ice and/or water layers absorb the wavelengths allowed to pass and then cause changes in the receiver if ice and/or water are present on the carriageway surface.  the changes in the light beams transmitted back are utilised for triggering an alarm signal.  <image>
