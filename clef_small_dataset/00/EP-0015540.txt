<ABSTRACT>
a new triazene compound of the formula:   r-ch= n-n= n-oh   wherein r is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl and its pharmaceutically  acceptable salt, and processes for their preparation, and a  pharmaceutical composition comprising as an effective inÂ­ gredient, the above compound.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
new triazene compound, production and use ther1bof this invention relates to new triazene compounds. more particularly, it relates to new triazene compounds which have relaxation activity on smooth muscle and hypotensive activity and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, to a process for the preparation thereof and to pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. accordingly, one object of this invention is to provide new triazene compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which have relaxation effect on muscle and hypotensive activity, and are useful for the treatment of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, bronchial disease or hypertension in human beings. another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing the triazene compounds by synthesis or fermentation of a fr-900184 and/or fr-900190 substanceproducing strain belonging to the genus streptomyces in a nutrient medium. a further object of this invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising the triazene compounds or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient. still further object of this invention is to provide a therapeutical method of treating cardiovascular diseases, bronchial diseases and hypertension by administration of the triazene compounds or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. triazene compound of this invention can be represented by the following formula: r-ch=n-n=n-oh (i) wherein r is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. the triazene compound represented by the formula (i) can also be represented by the following tautomeric formula (it): rch=n-nh-n=o (ii) and it is understood that the formula (i) and (ii) lie in the relation of tautomerism, with each other. then, as to the structural expression, it is to be noted that the formula (i) is used in the description of the invention for convenience' sake. the definition for r of the formula (i) is more particularly explained as follows. alkyl may be lower (cl-c6) ones (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl,etc.). alkenyl means unsaturated hydrocarbon residue and preferably includes higher (c6-c18) alkatrienyl (e.g. 1,3 ,5-decatrienyl ,l, 3 ,6-decatrienyl, etc.). aryl includes phenyl, tolyl, naphtyl and the like. the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the triazene compound (i) may include a.' salt with a base such as an inorganic base (e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammoniaj etc.). and an organic base (e.g. ethanolamine, triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, etc.). the triazene compound (i) can be prepared by the synthetic process and/or fermentation process, the details of which are illustrated as follows. synthetic process the synthetic process can be illustrated by the following reaction scheme: emi3.1 <tb> <sep> rcho <sep> (lit) <tb> <sep> x <sep> n2h4 <sep> (step <sep> a) <tb> <sep> t <sep> silylating <sep> agent <sep> (step <sep> b) <tb> <sep> ,j/ <sep> n-nitrosating <sep> agent <sep> (step <sep> c) <tb> rch-- <sep> n <sep> n=n-oh <sep> t) <tb> wherein r is as defined above. in this process, the object compound (i) can b prepared by reacting the compound (iii) with hydrazine, silylating agent and then n-nitrosatingagent. the starting compound (iii) includes known and new ones. the new compound, for example, 2,4,7-undecatrienal, 2,4,6-undecatrienal canoe prepared
