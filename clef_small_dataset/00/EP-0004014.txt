<ABSTRACT>
1.  developer solution for developing exposed, light-sensitive copying layers which contain a diazonium salt polycondensation product and a water-insoluble organic polymer, the developer solution comprising a buffered aqueous solution composed of a water-soluble polymer, an anionic wetting agent and an organic solvent which is miscible with water and having a ph in the range from 3 to 9, characterized in that the solution contains from 0. 5 to 15 percent by weight of an anionic wetting agent, from 0. 5 to 6 percent by weight of poly-n-vinyl-n-methyl-acetamide or from 1 to 5 percent by weight of polyvinyl alcohol, as a water-soluble polymer, from 0. 5 to 6 percent by weight of a salt or salt mixture which stabilizes the ph value in the specified range, from 0. 5 percent by weight up to saturation concentration of benzyl alcohol and from 0. 5 percent by weight up to saturation concentration of glycerol triacetate.
