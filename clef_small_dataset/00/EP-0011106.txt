<ABSTRACT>
a portable electric router including a housing enclosing  an electric motor, and having a router bit extending from one  end of the housing and driven by the motor.  a router base  assembly includes handles and a flat base plate and is adjust­ ably fixed to the housing.  the flat plate supports the router for  movement along a work surface and is provided with a central  opening through which the router bit extends to engage and  penetrate the work surface.  the other end of the housing has a  support surface upon which the router can rest when the  router is temporarily put down during use and when it is  stored, or while the bit is changed, or while the base assembly  is adjusted relative to the housing for depth adjustment of the  bit.  a switch is provided on the housing for turning the router  motor on" and "off", and is controlled by a switch operator  having a portion which extends through an opening in the  router housing support surface.  the switch operator has one  portion which extends beyond the support surface when the  electric motor is "on", and is positioned flush with that sur­ face when the motor is "off" so that the motor is "off" and  cannot be turned "on" when the router is supported on its  support surface.  the switch operator has another portion  rigidly connected to the one portion and which is at the side of  the router housing and close to one of the handles for turning  the motor "on" and "off".
