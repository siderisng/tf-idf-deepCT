<ABSTRACT>
an electrical plug (42) for mating with a multi-contact  female connector (8) on a telecommunications distribution  panel, comprises electrical terminals (56) arranged in  back-to-back relationship in compartments (60) of an insulating  housing (44), each terminal having a wire receiving  portion (47) and a contact blade (54).  so that the lateral dimensions of the plug (42) are  small enough to allow a different plug (42) to be mated  with each pair of contacts of the female connector, each  terminal (56) is substantially uniplanar, the contact blades  (54) being contained in channels in a h-section portion of  the plug housing (44), the planes of the blades (54) being  parallel with the side walls of the channels.
