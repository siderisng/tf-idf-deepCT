<ABSTRACT>
improvements in mechanical handling equipment  comprising a mobile auxiliary lifting and lowering device  intended for use with a power-driven truck, the device  comprising a wheeled frame (11, 13) supporting generally  horizontally-extending tines (19); means allowing the  device to be selectively coupled and uncoupled respectively  to and from the lifting carriage of the truck; first  power-driven means (35) to raise and lower the tines of the  device relative to the frame; and second power-driven  means (15a) to drive each wheel (15) of a transversely-spaced-apart  pair of the device's wheels independently  in either direction of rotation; both said power-driven  means (35, 15a) being adapted to be controlled from the  truck.  the last mentioned power-driven means (15a) may  comprise two motor-in-wheel units (15a), one in each  driven wheel (15), and each of the motor-in-wheel units  (15a) may swivel about a respective steering axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements in mechatical handling equipment" field of the invention the invention relates to mechanical handling equipment, and is particularly concerned with mobile auxiliary lifting and lowering devices intended for use with a power-driven lift truck. review of the prior art there are already known several forms of mobile steerable auxiliary lifting and lowering devices, intended for use with power-driven parent lift trucks and comprising: a wheeled frame supporting generally horizontally extending tines; means allowing the device to be selectively coupled to and uncoupled from a lifting carriage of the parent truck; first power-driven means, adapted to be controlled from the parent truck, to selectively raise and lower the tines of the device relative to its wheels; and second power-driven means, also adapted to be controlled from the parent truck, to drive the uncoupled device on its wheels selectively away from and back towards the truck. in use, the parent truck picks up the device and carries it as far as the open end of a container which is to be either loaded or unloaded. the device is then raised by the truck until it clears the floor of the container, the truck drives forward and deposits the device on the container floor, and the device is then coupled from the truck, driven forward into the container, manouevred so as to pick up, rearrange or deposit goods within the container, and is finally brought back to the parent truck, picked up by it and carried away to a further site. throughout the whole operation, the device is controlled from the parent truck. examples of such devices are shown in u.k. patent specifications nos. 1,440,062 (weldall), 1,429,785 (miller) and 1,453,387 (miller). also known to the applicants, although less relevant to the present invention, are u.s. patent specifications nos. 2,944,689 (not) and 2,833,435 (levy). the advantages given by these known forms of steerable auxiliary mobile lifting and lowering device are well known, and are fully described in the three patents first referred to above. each of the three known patented devices, however, exhibits certain drawbacks. these drawbacks can best be illustrated hy considering the devices described in the two miller specifications 1,429,785 and 1,453,387, which have been commercially the most successful of such devices. the device illustrated particularly in figures 5 to 9 of the earlier specification, 1,429,785, is clearly a prototype. it has, as far as is known, never been put into commercial production. as shown in figure 5, it is clearly inherently unstable and lacks the rigidity needed for repeated operation under heavy conditions of load. the later miller specification 1,453,387 describes and illustrates a device which has been developed from the prototype of specification 1,429,785, and which is in all essential respects identical to the commercial device now available. in this later device, one sees for example stabilising wheels 33 and an extensively detailed lifting, lowering and steering mechanism as well as a properly designed box frame and coupling means to join the device to the lifting carriage of its
