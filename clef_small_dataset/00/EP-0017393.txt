<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for estimating the slant visibility in obscured  atmospheres such as fog, whereby an indication is derived  as to when, during an aircraft landing approach in such  conditions, the aircrew are likely to be able to see the runway  lights.  the apparatus comprises a transmissometer array  arranged to take visibility readings over a slanted distance  from different heights not far from a runway threshold, and a  computer arranged to compare the readings with a plurality  of fog profile models, to determine the definitive model and  hence to derive and indicate a visual acquisition estimate.
