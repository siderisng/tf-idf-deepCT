<ABSTRACT>
a dished screen (11) placed in engine intake manifold  openings (13) beneath a carburetor (17) in the path of intake  air flow with, under a one-barrel carburetor one recess dished  screen being used, and with a two-barrel carburetor two  recess dished screens being used.  the screen units are  positioned so that fuel laden air from the carburetor (17)  passes through screening of the screan units (11) with the  mesh and wire size of the screening coupled with depressed  dished shape of the screen units such as to optimize vaporizaÂ­ tion atomizing of fuel in the fuel air mixture being fed to the  engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
intake manifold fuel atomizing screen this invention relates in general to vaporization of liquid fuel fed 'to internal combustion engines and, in particular, to a liquid fuel vaporizing screen unit. the unit may be used singly or in multiple depending upon whether a carburetor is a one-barrel or multi-barrel carburetor feeding corresponding intake manifold openings. each screen unit is positioned in a manifold intake opening such that fuel laden air from the carburetor passes through screening of the screen units with screen mesh and wire size coupled with depressed dish shape of the screen units such as to optimize vaporization atomizing of fuel in the fuel air mixture being fed to the engine. fuel economy is an increasingly important consideration in vehicles, particularly with present energy problems and fuel shortages and constantly increasing fuel costs. further, present day problems of environmental pollution have resulted in legislative action requiring more efficient engines with less pollution to meet tighter emission standards. in meeting such standards, exhaust gas recirculation, catalytic converters and/or auxiliary air pumps and other associated controls are designed into vehicles, both passenger cars and trucks, resulting in greatly increased vehicle costs. still further, addition of such additional pollution control equipment is a further power drain on the vehicle engine further decreasing efficiency. obviously, if engine efficiency can be increased to the point that pollution control devices are no longer needed in meeting tightened pollution standards still further increases in efficiency are attainable through the lessened power loading with removal of driven equipment. if engine efficiency is such that catalytic converters and/or other pollution control devices are not needed then the range of fuels useable is expanded and the engine may be tuned for optimum engine efficiency and not for optimized pollution control device efficiency. with engines employing conventional carburetors for fuel vaporization a portion oz the intake air is used to break the fuel into fine droplets. since droplet size varies with intake air speed and intake air speed varies over a wide range droplet size varies from smaller droplets at higher intake air speeds to larger droplets at lower intake air speeds. it should be noted that there is some beneficial gasification of the fuel in the carburetor and delivery through intake manifolding. however, much of the fuel remains in the form of droplets of varying sizes passed into the intake manifold with much of air fuel mixing occurring downste m from the carburetor resulting in uneven cylinderto cylinder distribution. more complete vaporization of to lleads to more uniform mixing of fuel with air in the carburetor area and through the engine intake manifold. further, the more completely fuel is transformed to a vapor as opposed to a mist droplet state the efficiency of combustion in the cylinder is improved. it is an object of this invention to provide improved engine fuel feed gas vaporization, increase internal combustion engine efficiency and also to reduce emission pollution. according to the present invention i provide in a fuel atomizing screen for
