<ABSTRACT>
a method and an apparatus for manufacture of mould  pieces of mineral wool which is bound by a binder and which  has a substantially constant cross-section along the entire  length thereof, whereby mineral wool is manufactured in the  form of flocks and/or granules (24) and is impregnated or  mixed with a binder and is collected in a feeding chamber  (25) to which a forming channel (30) is connected, and the  mineral wool is continously or stepwise pressed into and  through the forming channel and during the movement in  the forming channel is subjected to a heat treatment to cure  the binder of the mineral wool, whereupon the continuous  body of bound mineral wool is expelled from the forming  chamber, if desired is subjected to a surface treatment or any  subsequent treatment and is cut into intended lengths.  the  forming chamber may include one or more cores (40) providing  one or more axial bores through the mineral wool body.   a suction fan (26) may be provided adjacent the inlet end of  the forming chamber, the suction side (32) of which is connected  to the interior of the forming chamber to suck flocks  and/or granules of mineral wool into the forming chamber,  whereas the blower side (29) thereof is connected to the  feeding chamber to keep the flocks and granules of mineral  wool fluidized.  the mineral wool is compressed during the  movement through the forming channel, and the feeding  and compression may be accomplished by a reciprocatable  piston (35) or a rotatable screw.  the compressing degree is  controlled by tongues (45), the lower ends of which can be  pressed radially inwards against the string of mineral wool  (44), thereby making the forming channel partially converging.
