<ABSTRACT>
particulate polyurethane polymers (micro-bits) are prepared  by comminuting a flexible polyurethane foam in an  inert fluid such as water.  the cell structure of the polyurethane foam has been  substantially destroyed so that the particulate material comprises  predominantly tripodal particles the characteristics of  which are such that the polyrethane micro-bits, when slurried  in water and incorporated in a paper formulation, yield  paper of improved tear and tensile strength properties.  the  micro-bits are useful to remove such contaminants as  phenols from aqueous and gaseous streams.  the nature of  the micro-bits may be seen in figure 2 of the accompanying  drawings.
