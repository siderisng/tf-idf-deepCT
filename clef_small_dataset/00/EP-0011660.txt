<ABSTRACT>
the preparation of an aluminium complex containing  silicon, the silicon having a hexagonal structured shape by  contacting pure aluminium metal with a source of acid which  removes and inhibits the formation of oxide thereon, contact­ ing the aluminium metal (1) with mercury (4) in an oxygen  gas-containing atmosphere and at least partly immersing said  mercury contacted aluminium in an acidic solution containing  halogen ions (3) to form a slurry of at least 1. 5% by weight of  aluminium particles therein at a temperature of not more than  40°c.  the complex can be used for energising applications.  the aluminium complex is particularly useful for releas­ ing oxygen and hydrogen under pressure containing fluid in a  confined container.  the activated complex for this purpose  contains not more than 5% by weight of halogen, silicon,  oxygen and hydrogen and is contacted with the oxygen and  hydrogen under pressure containing fluid in a confined con­ tainer.  the present invention allows an environmentally accept­ able propellant to be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a novel siliconcontaining aluminum complex and to method for the preparation thereof. ilore particularly the complex of this invention contains minor amounts of halogen, activated silicon, oxygen and hydrogen in certain relationship, whereby said complex has the capability when added to a hydrogen and oxygen-containing fluid to release oxygen and hydrogen there form and to so energize such fluid that oxygen and hydrogen will continue to be released therefrom. this invention also relates to the intermediate slurry formed during the process of making the complex. the usefulness of the complex of this invention will extend virtually to any application where such energizing ability would be advantageous. for example, the complex of this invention will effect the pressurization of a confined container including any one of a myriad of active ingredients or adjuvants, e.g., non-food foam products such as shave creams, shampoos, oven cleaners; foods such as whipped toppings and cheese spreads;low viscosity personal and household product such as hairsprays, deodorants, insecticides, colognes, antisz- tics and medicants; high viscosity products such as saints, varnistles and acrylic coatings; which ingredients or adjust2nvs can this be an @@@@ from sake container in the form desired, e.q., as a gas @yde, solid or foam. in effect, therefore, the comple. as the invention providens a dramatic replacement for the gas initiated aerosol propellants, particularly the fluorocarbons but also hydrocarbon and compressed gas systems. moreover, unlike the fluorocarbons, the subject complex is non-polluting and safe environmentally havig no adverse impact of any kind on ozone. coupled with its non -- activeness ale non-flamability, and the minor amounts needed or such energizing, the potential implications of the ssubject complex are enormous. in addition to its usefulness in making the complex, the intermediate slurry is also useful in the preparation of other products. according to this invention, the activated aluminum complex consists essentially of aluminum and minor amounts of alorine,. activated hexagonally structured silicon, oxygen and hydrogen; the oxygen and hydrogen being present in atomic proportions on usually 16:18 or occasionally 14:16, 18:20 or mixtures thereof and the such of said chlorine, silicon, hydrogen ad oxygen atoms not exceeding more than about 5 percent by eight of the aluminum atoms of said complex. the complex can be prepared by the following sequence @@ steps; @@ @@ stus@@ny iluminum metal having a purity @@ oder @@@@@@@@ oder of at least about 99.97% by weight, but including at least trace amounts of silicon, with a source of acid of a type and concentration which will remove and inhibit the formation of oide thereon; simultaneously o thereafter contacting said aluminum metal with mercury or less preferably a source of mercury an oxygen-containing atmosphere; 2) at least partly immersing said mercury contacted aluminium in an acidic solution containing halogen to effect a slurry of particles of said mercurycontacted aluminium in said halogen-acidic solution, at a temperature of between ambient and not more than about 30 c; 3) increasing the pll of said slurry to the ph wherein
