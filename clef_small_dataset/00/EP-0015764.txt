<ABSTRACT>
a floppy disc drive assembly with direct disc rotational  drive, comprises (a) a step motor having a plurality of pole  pairs with coils (55) and pole pieces (53), the latter being  fabricated at predetermined locations from the base (50) of  the drive housing and (b) a disc armature (62) having radial  webs (64) and rotatably mounted in bearing (60, 61) on base  (50) so that pairs of radial webs (64) align one pair at a time  with successive ones of successively energized pole pairs  (53, 55).  in this manner an efficient and compact assembly is  formed.  means are provided which enable clutch to engage  a floppy disc with a disc drive ring 68 only when the floppy  disc is properly seated within the assembly.
