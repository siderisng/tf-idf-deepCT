<ABSTRACT>
an improved process for preparing the antibiotic com­ pound 7β-(2-thienylacetamido)-7-methoxy-3-­ carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, from the  n-blocked esters of the compound 7β-(d-5-amino-5-­ carboxyvaleramido)-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-methoxy-3-­ cephem-4-carboxylic acid (cephamycin c), by conducting  the transacylation of the latter in a homogeneous solution  containing either (1) n-trimethylsilyl loweralkyl carbamates  or (2) a trimethyl silyl enol ether.

<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention: improved process for the preparation of cephamycin antibiotics. relationship to the prior art: the first disclosure in the patent literature of transacylation of cephamycin c is in u.s. patent no. 4,014,873, issued march 29, 1977. this process was conducted in the presence of a silylating agent. an improved transacylation, utilizing molecular sieves is claimed in u.s. patent no. 4,053,286, issued october 11, 1977. the general chemistry of the transacylation reaction is in weinstock et al., "the chemistry of cephamycins iv. acylation of amides in the presence of neutral acid scavengers", tet. letters, 46, 3979 (1975). the patent, u.s. patent 4,014,873, discos± silyl urethane reagents identical to those of the instant application, that is emi1.1 (formula h, col. 3) wherein r5, r7, r8 and rg could be alkyl 1-8, and r6 was hydrogen. a particular silyl urethane named included n-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl carbamate, also called n-trimethylsilyl ethyl urethan, col. 9, line 17, and n-trimethylsilyl methyl urethane, col. 9, lines 17-18. the particular silyl enol ethers of this invention were not disclosed in this patent. 'the process disclosed in that patent was primarily directed to an acylation, e.g., with thienylacetyl chloride of cephamvcin c, the latter being a fermentation product prepared from streptomyces lactamdurans nrrl 3802, on permanent unrestricted deposit. under certain conditions, (such as prolonging the reaction time, col. 9, line 38), this acylation was taught to proceed in one step, see col. 9, lines 35 to col. 10, line 7. none of the examples actually used the silyl urethanes of the above formula. when the silylating agent was used in the reaction, a molecular excess was employed, see col. 38, lines 44-45, in claim 1. summary of the invention: it has now been discovered that using about an equivalent amount of a silylurethane or a trimethyl silyl enol ether in the acylation reaction, a significantly higher, unexpected yield of final product can be quickly and easily recovered. the silyl urethane reagent: the silyl urethane of this invention is a trimethyl silyl loweralkyl carbamate, emi2.1 where r is 1-4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, or n-butyl. particularly preferred is trimethylsilyl methyl carbamate. with this reagent, about .8 to about 1.5 equivalents of the trimethylsilyl methyl carbamate, relative to cephamycin c starting material is the optimal level to produce the final product in high yield. the trimethyl silyl enol ether reagent the trimethylsilyl enol ether of this invention is: emi3.1 wherein r1 can be lower alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms; r2 is hydrogen or loweralkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms; or r1 and r2 can be a joined alkyl chain of 2-4 carbon atoms. particularly preferred compounds are those in which r2 is h and r1 is ch3, or 2trimethylsiloxyl propene; or r1 and r2 are a joined alkyl chain of 4 carbon atoms, or l-trimethylsiloxyl cyclohexene. these trimethylsilyl enol ethers of formula ii are made by reacting an appropriate ketone emi3.2 with trimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of base, such as sodium hydride. this chemistry is in the literature,

<CLAIMS>
 having fully described this invention, what   is claimed is:  1. in the process of preparing the compound emi15.1       by reacting thienylacetyl chloride with emi15.2       wherein r is p-tosyl in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride at a temperature of between 50   90 c,    the improvement comprising carrying out the reaction in the presence of either (1) about .8 to 1.5 equivalents of trimethylsilyl loweralkyl carbamate or (2) about .8 to 4 equivalents of trimethylsilyl enol ether emi15.3       wherein r1 can be lower alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms; r2 is hydrogen or loweralkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms; or r1 and r2 can be a joined alkyl chain of 2-4 carbon atoms;    2. the process of claim 1 in which the trimethylsilyl loweralkyl carbamate has 1-4 carbon atoms in the loweralkyl.     3. the process of claim 1 in which trimethylsilyl methyl carbamate is used.    4. the process of claim 1 in which trimethylsilyl ethyl carbamate is used.    5. the process of claim 1 in which the trimethylsilyl enol ether is 2-trimethylsiloxyl propene.    6. the process of claim 1 in which the trimethylsilyl enol ether is l-trimethylsiloxyl cyclohexene.
