<ABSTRACT>
a liquid level detector comprises a light transmissive  element (26) having a display area (28), and a number of  vertically displaced surface portions (30, 44 to 54, or 72  and 74) located below this display area (28) and arranged  in a helical path around a vertical axis.  when no liquid is  present at a surface portion light is internally reflected  thereby to the display area (28), and, when liquid is present,  light is refracted into the liquid.  as the liquid level increases,  an indication (42, 68 or 78) on said display area (28)  moves in a generally circumferential direction around the  area.  the surface portions can either be discrete, discon­ tinuous surfaces (44 to 54, or 72 and 74), or form a con­ tinuous region (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
title liquid level detector technical field this invention relates to liquid level detectors, and in particular to the type of detector which comprises a member of light transmitting material, having a surface which internally reflects light to a display area when there is no liquid present at the surface, and which, when liquid is present at the surface, refracts the light into the liquid. background art it is known to provide liquid level detectors made of light transmissive material and having a surface including a display area and a portion arranged for internally reflecting light entering the detector toward the display area. the refractive index of the material and the angular position of the surface portion are so arranged that when liquid is present at the surface portion the light is refracted into the liquid, so that the display area becomes dark to indicate the presence of the liquid. the surface portion may have a substantially conical shape, with the axis of the cone extending vertically, the arrangement being such that when the liquid level is part-way up the cone a circular indication is given on the display area. the diameter of the indication will indicate the precise location of the liquid level. it is also known to use detectors having several such surface portions, the portions being vertically displaced from each other so that the detector is operable to provide indications representing several discrete liquid levels. one form of such a detector has a generally cylindrical shape, the portions forming coaxial, circular tapered surfaces extending around the cylinder. with the above-mentioned types of detectors, it is necessary to judge the diameter of the indication on the display area to determine the level of the liquid. this can creat difficulties when the precise location of the level is to be determined. furthermore, if several surface portions are provided for indicating discrete levels, the number of such portions which can be provided without severely impairing the clarity and definition of the display is limited. disclosure of invention in accordance with the invention, a liquid level detector comprises a member of light transmissive material having a surface including a number of portions which are, with the detector in a position for use, vertically displaced from each other, and each of which is arranged in such a manner that, when no liquid is present at the portion, light entering the member is internally reflected thereby to a display area on said surface, and, when liquid is present, said light is refracted into said liquid, characterised in that the surface portions are located so that, with the detector in its use position, they are successively arranged around a vertical axis, whereby the level of liquid can be determined from the angular position of an indication around a point on said display area. with such an arrangement, the liquid level is determined by judging the angular position, rather than the diameter, of an indication. this makes the indication easier to read, and hence liquid level

claims   1. a liquid level detector comprising a member (26) of light transmitting material having a surface including a number of portions (e.g. 30, 44 to 54, or 72 and 74) which are, with the detector in a position for use, vertically displaced and each of which is arranged in such a manner that, when no liquid is present at said portion, light entering the member is internally reflected thereby to a display area (28) on said surface, and, when liquid is present, said light is refracted into said liquid, characterised in that the surface portions (e.g. 30, 44 to 54, or 72 and 74) are located so that, with the detector in its use position, they are successively arranged around a vertical axis, whereby the level (38) of liquid can be determined from the angular position of an indication (e.g. 42, 68 or 78) around a point on said display area.   2. a detector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said surface portions form a continuous region (30) extending upwardly and around said vertical axis, so as to provide a continuous indication (42) of said liquid level (38).   3. a detector as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said surface portions (44 to 54) are discrete, and each have a substantially conical shape.     4. a detector as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said portions (72 and 74) are discrete, and each has an apex (70) and a pair of surfaces (72 and 74) extending upwardly from opposite sides of said apex (70).   5. a detector as claimed in claim 4, wherein said surfaces (72 and 74) are displaced radially with respect to said axis.   6. a detector as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that said surfaces (72 and 74) are circumferentially displaced with respect to said apex (70).    7. a detector as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the maximum diameter of each of said conical portions varies progressively from the lowest (44) of said portions to the highest (54) of said portions.   8. a detector as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said surface portions (30, 44 to 54, or 72 and 74) are arranged in a helical path around said vertical axis, the display area, in the use position of the detector, comprising a substantially horizontal surface (28) located above said surface portions.   9. a detector as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of said surface portions has at least two areas which, in use of the detector, are inclined at 450 to the horizontal, and arranged to reflect a vertical light ray to each other when no liquid is present at said surface portion.
