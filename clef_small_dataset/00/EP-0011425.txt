<ABSTRACT>
a flexible disc memory system has the memory discs  arranged in a stack (24) comprising sub-stacks in each of  which the discs are of progressively increasing diameters.  a  picker (34a) having unequal arms and carrying magnetic  transducers (c,d) is positioned opposite a disc to be acces足 sed and is moved inwards to capture the disc and read from  the required information track on it.  the picker executes a sequence of movements, under  the control of a microprocessor (50), in which it is positioned  adjacent to the edge of the disc to be accessed, then moved  axially so that its longer arm displaces the selected disc  towards the direction of increasing disc diameters, then  moved inwards to capture the disc, then axially in the oppo足 site direction to restore the disc to its normal plane of rota足 tion, and finally radially inwards, so that a transducer can  read from an information track.  when accessing the largest disc of any sub-stack the  picker movement includes a further step, after capturing the  disc, of moving axially in the direction of diminishing disc  diameter, and then moving radially inwards until it is within  the smallest disc diameter before returning the disc to its  normal plane of rotation.  this avoids the possibility of cap足 turing also the smallest disc of the next adjoining sub-stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
flexible disc memory system the invention relates to flexible disc memory systems in which the memory discs are arranged in a stack comprising sub-stacks in each of which the discs are of progressively increasing diameters. a picker having unequal arms and carrying magnetic transducers is positioned opposite a disc to be accessed, and is moved inwards to capture the disc and read from an information track on it. systems of this general kind are known, for example, from u.s. patent 3 703 713. because of the build-up of tolerances in manufacture, and because the discs are not rigid and may flop about during rotation, there are difficulties in the known systems in selecting the required disc uniquely and with certainty. in operation it may happen either that the picker fails to capture a disc, or captures two discs simultaneously. it is an object of the present invention to avoid this difficulty. the present invention uses a picker having parallel unequal arms as in the united states patent referred to above. in the accessing operation the picker is initially positioned adjacent to and axially opposite the edge of the disc to be accessed in the direction of diminishing disc diameters. this allows for axial vibration and tolerance build-up. because of the difference between the diameters of the selected disc and the adjacent smaller discs, the location of the picker prevents the accessing of any of the adjacent smaller discs. next in the accessing motion, the picker moves axially past the normal plane of rotation of the disc to be accessed, so that the short picker arm pushes the larger discs away, and the larger arm positions the desired disc in the gap of the picker arms. at this location, the disk to be accessed is positioned beyond its amplitude of vibration and beyond a location that might exist due to tolerance build-up. capturing the disk to be accessed now requires that the picker moves radially inwards, so that the disc is trapped between the two arms. by this technique, the likelihood of accessing an incorrect disc or missing the desired disc is minimal. the accessing technique in accordance with the invention is completed by returning the captured disc to its normal plane of rotation by a movement of the picker and then moving the picker inwards so that the transducer is opposite the information to be read. it should be noted that selection of the largest disc of a stack is achieved by steps additional to those described above. the invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which figure 1 is a schematic arrangement of the flexible disc memory assembly and control system of the invention. figure 2 depicts the flexible disc memory sub-stack having different diameter discs which are arranged in an ascending order wherein the parallel arm disc picker or probe is positioned in a fully retracted position in an axial and radial direction, which is designated as home x, y. figure 3 shows

<CLAIMS>
 claims   1. a flexible disc memory system in which a stack (24) of flexible discs is mounted on a common axis (10), the discs being arranged in sub-stacks (32), the discs in each sub-stack being of progressively increasing diameters, and in which a picker (34a) having parallel unequal arms (p, q) and carrying at least one magnetic transducer (c,d) is positioned axially and advanced radially inwards to select a disc for reading or writing, characterised in that the movement of the picker (34a) includes the steps of  a) positioning the picker adjacent and axially opposite to the edge  of the disc to be accessed in the direction of diminishing disc  diameters;  b) moving the picker in the axial direction of increasing disc  diameters so that the longer picker arm displaces the disc to  be accessed and separates it from the discs of smaller  diameters; ;  c) moving the picker radially inward to capture the said disc;  d) moving the picker axially in the direction of diminishing disc  diameters to return the said disc to its normal plane of  rotation;  e) moving the picker radially inward to position a transducer head  opposite a track to be accessed.   2. a flexible disc memory system according to claim 1 further characterised in that, in the case in which the disc to be accessed is the largest disc (32) of a sub-stack, the movement of the picker after capturing the said disc further includes the steps of  f) moving the picker axially in the direction of diminishing disc  diameters to separate the disc from the smallest diameter disc  of the next adjacent sub-stack;  g) moving the picker radially inwards until its shorter arm is  within the radius of the said smallest disc; before finally moving the picker axially to return the disc to its normal plane of rotation and moving the picker radially inwards to position a transducer head opposite a track to be accessed.      3. a flexible disc memory system according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the speed of the rotation of the discs lies within the range   250-75?    rpm.
