<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to data processing apparatus inclu­ ding multiple peer processors (1, 2, 3, 4) competing for  ownership of system resources.  as described in order to pro­ vide for flexible resolution with low system interference, the  processors are coupled to a mapping and communicating unit  5 via respective private resolution mechanisms (ief) which  resolve internal conflicts for currently owned resources and  pass requests for ownership for other resources.  unit 5 main­ tains a resource by class owner map which is interrogated and  the request is passed only to those processors indicated as  owners of resources within the class.  each receiving proces­ sor performs a private resource resolution according to pro­ tocol common to all the processors and transmits an appro­ priate message, response being according to a composite  message assemble from the messages from all interested  parties, the map being updated by class.
