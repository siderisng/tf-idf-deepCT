<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a transducer assambly and diagnostic ap­ paratus for processing an electrical signal which varies  with the pressure changes occurring within an engine cy­ linder.  the transducer assembly (100) consists of a u-­ shaped structure (104) integrally formed in a sandwich ar­ rangement and encompassing a pressure-responsive crys­ talline element (106).  the assembly is sized such that it  substantially encompasses the shank (92) of a spark or  glow plug (90) of the engine such that axial forces from  within the cylinder excite the transducer through the plug  to produce a signal which is processed in an electrical cir­ cuit to provide timing or other diagnostic information.
