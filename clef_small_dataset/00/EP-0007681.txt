<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for measuring out a desired length of electric  cable (1) and transporting it to a work station (a, b or c)  comprises means (2,3) for supplying the cable along a supply  path through a guiding structure which includes a retractable  guide element (7c) arranged under automatic control to be  retracted when the end portion of the cable reaches the  downstream end of the supply path so that during further  cable supplying, the cable forms a loop (1) which may hang  downwardly with the leading end of the cable retained at or  adjacent the downstream end of the supply path.  when the  desired length of cable has been formed into a loop, the cable  is severed by cutting means (2a) from the supply (2,3), and  with gripping means (4, 5) holding the respective ends of the  cable, a lateral displacement device (11, 12) is operated to  convey the cable to a work station (a, b or c), at the same time  bringing further gripping means (4,5) into position ready for  the next cycle of operation.  at the work station (a, b or c) any  desired operation such as insulation stripping may be effecÂ­ ted.
