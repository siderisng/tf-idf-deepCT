<DESCRIPTION>
-(araylthiocarbamoyl)-2-amino-ih-isolindole-1,3 (2h)diones and use as-plant growth regulamors growth regulating effects have been observed upon application of many chemical substances to plants. in general, very few of these substances can be used with benefit to the plants which are affected. in most instances the beneficial effects, if any, are minor and the major effects are so drastic that the compounds can only be used for the destruction of the plants. examples of growth regulator compounds with drastic effects which have become useful as herbicides are 2,4-d, eptc and alachior. among the potential commercial uses for growth regulator compounds with less drastic effects are the following increase or induce flowering (pineapple). increase blossom set, pod set, seed set, and/or fruit set (prevent abortion of flowers or withered blossoms). increase size of fruits, vegetables, seed, and/or tubers (grapes, soybeans, sugar beets, etc). decrease size of fruit, vegetables, seed, and/or tubers (potatoes, and grapefruits). increase number of tillers (cereals). increase number of shoots from crown (alfal¯a) increase branching (soybeans) or widen branches (apples). reduce height (shortened internodes) in crops ana ornamentals (cereals and mums). growth retardent (turf, cotton, perennial legumes in no-till corn). enhance yields of corn by larger ears, better filled ears and/or more ears per plant increase nutritive value of seeds, fruits, vegetables, forages, etc (protein content). reduce transpiration (drought resistance). reduce respiration (potatoes or sugar beets in storage we have discovered a group of novel compounds which display a great variety of growth regulating effects, indicating utility for many purposes1 including uses mentioned above the present invention is directed to these novel compounds, including methods of manufacture, as well as methods and formulations for plant growth regulation. briefly, the novel class of growth regulator compounds has the general structural formula: emi2.1 in which r1 is; c1 to c4 altyl, nitro or halo and n is zero or an integer from 1 to 4 22 and r3 are; h or c1 to c4 alkyl, or benzyl and ar is; adamantyl, c3 to c4 alkyl or alkenyl, benzyl, halo- benzyl, naphthyl, phenyl or phenyl bearing thereon from one to three of the substituents: cyanor benzyloxy, nitro, bromo, chloro, trifluoronethyl and c1 to c4 alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkylthio and alkyl-substituted amino. the' aforementioned compounds are employed to regulate the growth of plants by applying an effective amount to the plants, the seed or the soil, preferably in combin ation with an inert carrier or diluent and a surface active agent, according to customary practice in the art. synthesis of 'the growth regulators the novel compounds of this invention may be produced from commercially available raw materials by means of procedures based on those outlined and specifically illustrated below: among methods by which the compounds of formula (i) may be made are the following: 1. reacting a compound of the formula emi3.1 in a mutual solvent with a compounds of the tormula emi3.2 in the presence of an acid acceptor or with a compound of the formula scn-ar. 2 reacting a compound of the formula
