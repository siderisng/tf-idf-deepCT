<ABSTRACT>
an integral power steering gear assembly (10) has oil  capillary slots (50, 51) fed with high pressure fluid from feed  grooves along the sides of the piston (11) adjacent the output  rack (18).  the slots (50, 51) are designed to have a shallow  depth, providing capillary attraction of the oil molecules.  the  trapped oil molecules prevent, molecular interaction between  the piston (11) and cylinder wall, but at the same time, the oil  molecules remain trapped or isolated within the walls of the  slots (50, 51) thereby minimizing leakage.  the operating oil is  delivered in the power steering unit by a bifurcated oil deliv­ ery passage (31) communicating with the inlet slot (22) of the  piston.  this provides fluidized balance and cushioning of the  valve (20) within the piston, and also prevents starvation of  the high pressure feed grooves and capillary slots for balanc­ ing and cushioning the piston (11) within the cylinder (13).
