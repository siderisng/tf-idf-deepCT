<ABSTRACT>
an electrostatic machine has a moving photosensitive  drum (10) on which electrostatic images are formed and  developed by means of toner powder.  the developed images  are transferred to copy paper and the drum cleaned for re-use.   the drum (10) carries with it a boundary layer of air in which  unwanted loose toner particles are entrained.  a scavenging  chamber has a mouth to draw air from the boundary layer into  a vacuum chamber (47).  the mouth has a lip (46) forming with  the drum (10) a venturi passage (48) through which the air  flows to expand into the scavenging chamber.  a further knife  edge lip (49) peels the boundary layer air from the drum.
