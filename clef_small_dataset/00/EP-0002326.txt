<ABSTRACT>
a valve sack is made from tubular material whose  opposed longitudinal edges have been gusseted.  there is  formed in one of the gussets an aperture (s) which extends  along the gusset for a distance appreciably less than the  width (d) of eventual sack.  the outer longitudinal edges of  the gusset are then sealed together, either directly or via a  further sheet of material, over a distance greater than the  length of said aperture, to form a tube running along one  longitudinal edge of the material.  the material is then sealed  together along two lines which run across the material and  are spaced apart to define the width of the eventual sack.   one end of the tube is sealed off.  a further aperture  overlapping the first mentioned aperture if formed in the  tube.
