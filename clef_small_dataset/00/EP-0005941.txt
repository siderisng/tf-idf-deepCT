<ABSTRACT>
a teller machine which includes a dispenser (8) for  dispensing banknotes or other items for delivery to a  customer in accordance with a customer-requested transaction,  is switchable (19) between a first, teller-assist mode in  which the dispenser (8) dispenses under human control  exercised from a teller's station (2), and a second, automated  mode in which dispensing is under programmed control in  accordance with customer requests entered into the machine  from a customer's station (3).  the two stations (2,3) are  located close to one another, in particular opposite across a  counter-top (6), and the dispenser (8) dispenses to a position  within reach from both stations (2,3), in particular into a pan  (5) sunk into the counter-top (6), whereby delivery to the  customer of dispensed items when the machine is operating  in its first mode is within the personal influence of the human  teller in the provision of personal service to customers while  the teller's station (2) is manned.
