<ABSTRACT>
in dyeing keratinous fibres, such as wool, by impregnating  the fibres with aqueous compositions containing dyes,  followed by storage in the moist condition, a higher level of  fixation, enabling heavier shades to be obtained with cheaper  dyes, can be achieved by raising the temperature of the stored  fibres by means of radio frequency heating.  the storage  temperature is preferably between 40 and 80Â°c, which usually  requires about 0. 05 kw hour/kg fibres.  acid, milling, chrome  and premetallised dyes can be used, as well as reactive dyes  and substantive optical brighteners.  the fibres are cuttled into  an insulated plastics material cart (18) located between a pair  of electrodes in a radio-frequency chamber.  one electrode  (14) is fixed and the other (16) is adjustable so that the r. f.  load  acting on the fibres may be set at a desired value.
