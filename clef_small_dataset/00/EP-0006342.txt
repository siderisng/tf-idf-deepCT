<ABSTRACT>
a device and method for folding the main and seÂ­ condary flaps of self-sealing envelopes into the inoperative  condition.  the envelopes (11) are fed, bottom edge leading,  into a roller (20), the front panel of the envelope being in  contact with the roller.  the bottom edge lifts off the roller  and the envelope is arrested and temporarily supported  by abutment means (38, 40, 44) while the main flap (16)  of the envelope is held to the roller by suction (22, 24) and  carried around the roller and thereby folded relative to the  front panel of the envelope.  in this position of the envelope,  the secondary flap (18) slidably engages the surface of the  roller and is then arrested by stop means (28) which carry  the secondary flap (18) around and fold it relative to the  back panel of the envelope.
