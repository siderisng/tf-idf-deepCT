</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
oxazolidinone phosphonate this invention relates toy new class of organic chemical compounds. more particularly, this invention is concerned with novel heterocyclic compounds which can generally be designated as derivatives of oxazolidin-5-one. the specific derivatives herein are those wherein an alkylene phosphonic acid aryl ester group is substituted at the nitrogen atom of the heterocvclic ring. belgian patent 83o,276 describes the preparation of certain oxazolidin-5-ones wherein a methylene phosphonic acid alkyl ester group is attached to the ring nitrogen. such compounds are shown to be useful as herbicides. it has now been found that when said ring nitrogen.contains an alkylene phosphonic acid aryl ester group thereon, desirable herbicidal activity is also observed. the compounds of the present invention may be represented by the structural formula emi1.1 wherein r is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, o-tolyl and trifluoromethylphenyl, and x and y are each methyl or hydrogen the novel compounds of the present invention can be prepared by reacting methyl or ethyl glycinate with formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, and subsequent reaction of the product with a diaryl phosphite. the molar ratio of reactants is approximately 1 glycinate: 2 aldehyde: 1 phosphiter and it has been found that the two moles of the aldehyde reactant can comprise one mole of each aldehyde, added sequentially. the glycinate and formaldehyde are preferably reacted in accordance with the following equation: emi2.1 the phosphite can then be added, and it is believed that the reaction is sequential, giving off first water and then alcohol during cyclization as seen in the equation: emi2.2 if acetaldehyde is used instead of formaldehyde, the following equation is believed to illustrate the reaction path: emi2.3 the following illustrative, non-limiting examples will serve to further demonstrate to those skilled in the art the manner in which specific compounds of this invention can be prepared. in the examples, all parts are parts by weight unless otherwise expressly stated. example i a suitable reaction vessel was charged with 6.4 grams of methyl glycinate hydrochloride in 50 ml. of methanol. the solution was neutralized with 25% sodium methoxide in methanol to the phenolphthalein endpoint. the resultant methyl glycinate solution was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to dryness and then redissolved in 100 ml. of benzene. to the benzene solution of methyl glycinate was added 8.0 grams of formalin (0.1 equiv. of formaldehyde) slowly with constant stirring and cooling. after stirring 15 minutes, anhydrous magnesium sulfate was added to remove the water and filtered off, and then 11.7 grams of purified diphenyl phosphite was added at once. the solution was decanted from the residue and concentrated to dryness up to 500c. in vacuo. the viscous residual oil in benzene/cyclohexane was passed over a charcoal column, eluting with benzene. after about 200 ml. had been eluted, a 60 ml. sample was collected and concentrated, and the residual oil was dried for 2 hours at 560c./l 1 inn'. the product, obtained as a light yellow oil, was 3-(diphenoxyphosphinylmethyl) oxazolidin-5-one, nd22 1.5550. elemental analysis gave 4.11% nitrogen and 9.24%
