<ABSTRACT>
a tetrahydro-2h- benzo[c]pyrrole compound of the gen­ eral formula    wherein   r¹ is h or r²;   am is n(r²)₂; and   each r² is independently allyl, methyl, ethyl, or  n-propyl; and   the pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts  thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrroles this invention provides substituted 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrroles of the general formula emi1.1 wherein rú is h or rê; am is n(rê)2; and each r2is independently allyl, methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl; and the pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts thereof. the compounds of formula i are prepared by reacting a 5-amino-4,5,6, 7-tetrahydro-2hbenzo[c]pyrrole compound of the formula emi1.2 with an aldehyde and then reducing with a metal hydride; or with an alkyl halide, then an acyl halide followed by reducing with a meta hydride; to provide the compounds of formula i wherein rú is x, and am is n(rê)2; followed by reacting with an alkyl halide and base to provide the compounds of formula i wherein r1is r21 and am is n(r2 )2 the compounds of formula i are useful as dopamine agonists including their use in treating parkinson's syndrome and as prolactin inhibitors. additionally, the following compounds are useful as novel intermediates and have the general formula emi2.1 wherein ri is h or emi2.2 am is nh2 or emi2.3 r' is methyl, ethyl or n-propyl; except that r1 is not emi2.4 when am is nh2; and the acid addition salts thereof when am is nh2. the pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formulae i and ia include salts derived from non-toxic inorganic acids such as: hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, nitrous acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from non-toxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenylsubstituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, and others. such pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1, 4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, ss- hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-l-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate and the like salts. acid addition salts of those intermediate compounds of formula ia are not restricted to those formed with non-toxic anions since the chief use of such salts is for isolation and purification of the intermediates involved. illustrative compounds coming within the scope of formula i above include: dl-5-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2hbenzo[c]pyrrole methane sulfonate. dl-2-methyl-5-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetra hydro-2h-benzolclpyrrole maleate. dl-5-diallylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2hbenzo[c]pyrrole sulfate. dl-2-ethyl-5-di(n-propyl)amino-4,5,6,7- tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrrole hydrochloride. n,n,2-trimethyl-dl-5-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrrole. n-methyl-n-allyl-dl-5-amino-4,5,6,7-tetra hydro-2h-benzo [cj pyrrole. dl-2-allyl-5-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrrole. n-methyl-n-ethyl-dl-5-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrrole. n-methyl-n-n-propyl-dl-2-methyl-5-amino4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]pyrrole. n-allyl-n-n-propyl-dl-5-amino-4,5,6,7 tetrahydro-2h-benzotclpyrrole. while the compounds represented by formula i have been named as 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2h-benzo[c]- pyrroles, an alternative name can be used; i.e., the compounds can be named as 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoindoles. the presence of a substituent at c-s in the benzo[cjpyrrole or isoindole ring introduces a center of assymmetry into those molecules. thus, compounds represented by formula i include two optical isomers occurring as a dl pair or racemate. resolution of a dl pair of formula i into its optical antipodes can be accomplished by procedures known to those skilled in the art. a process for preparing the novel intermediate
