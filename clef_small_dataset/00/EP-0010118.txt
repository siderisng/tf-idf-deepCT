<ABSTRACT>
Thermal exchange body between at least one fluid and a gas, in particular for atmospheric refrigerant, comprising a battery of trading tubing (4) inside what can flow the fluid, as well as means of pulvering (6, 7) a liquid on said tubes. To allow the watering of the exchange tubings (4) in the case where said tubes (4) are vertical or strongly inclined on the horizontal and are sealingly connected to their upper part to a first horizontal device (3) collector or distributor of said fluid, the spraying means (6.7) comprise a series of spray tubes (6) with their lower part of liquid spray devices (7), available alternately with said exchangers (4), parallel to them, and connected to their upper part to a second horizontal device (5) dispenser of liquid to spray the first device (3) and the second device (5) being arranged one above the other and the Tubes (4 resp. 6) connected to the device (3 resp. 5) placed above crossing the device (5 resp. 3) placed below.
