<ABSTRACT>
a container for dispensing flowable material through a  metering orifice (7), and which orifice discharges into a duct  (8), and a closure cap (1) for the container and which cap (1)  presents an internal pin (12) arranged to enter into the duct  (8) to terminate discharge of material from the orifice (7)  without touching the orifice (7).  to prevent flowable material  from lodging between the pin and the duct, thus adversely  affecting the closure, the duct (8), and the pin (12), have  cylindrical configurations so that the pin (12) slides piston-­ like into the duct (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
a container and closure cat for said container. the present invention relates to a container c.nd a closure cap for said container and wherein container contents are dispensed through a metering orifice and said cap includes a rin which, when the cap is mounted in a closure condition, prevents discharge of container contents through aid metering orifice. containers for flowable materials, such as liquids, pastes, gels and powders,arranged to dispense such materials through a metering orifice to obtain controlled discharge of the container contents are well known in the art. it is also known to provide such a container with a cap which presents a pin enge.geable in the metering orifice to close the container when the cap is in a closure condition. a serious disadvantetge with such container and cap combinations is that after a number of cap closures, wear between the pin and the metering orifice enlarge the meterinu; orifice l-hereb said orifice no longer affords the desires controlled discharge and such enlargement of the orifice with tjeor on the pin renders the closure defective. to overcome this problem the swiss 1:ateflt no. 4^65g5 proposes a container structure in which the metering orifice discharges into an elongate conical chamber which increases in cross section towards that end remote from the metering orifice and the cap presents a conical rin the taper of which is identical with the taper of the conical charnber. in a closure condition, the conical pin is entered into the conical cha#ber to prevent material flow from said chamber, and thereby from the metering orifice, without the rin contacting the metering orifice. the container and cap combination proposed by swiss tent lso. 426565 sffers fro an inherent defect in that, as the conical in is entering into the conical chamber to effect e. closure, container contents in the clamber car be trapped between the tapered side of the pin and the tapered well of the chamber, and as the pin advances into the chmber, the escape route for such trapped material is progressively lengthened and reduced in cross section. whilst some low viscosity liquids can escape to permit full closure without undue axial pressure on the assembly such full closure cannot be obtained with liquids of higher viscosity or solids materials in powder or granular form. the invention as claimed is intended to provide a simple design for a container closure and by which closure of the container metering orifice can be effected for most low pressure flowable materials without excessive loadings on the closure and without the danger of container contents being adversely trapped between closure surfaces of the assembly. the advantages offere by the invention are mainly that a pin presented by a closure cap has a generally cylindrical form, ? duct into which the metering orifice discharges has a cylindricvl form, nd closure is effected by the cylindrical pin sliding piston-like into the cylindrical duct so that container contents in said duct are pushed ahead of the pin and, when substantial, back

claims.   1. in combination, a container (c) and a closure cap (1) for said container (c), and wherein container contents are dispensed through a metering orifice (7) and said closure cap (1) includes a pin (12) which, when the closure cap (1) is in a closure condition, prevents discharge of container contents from said metering orifice (7) characterised in that the metering orifice (7) discharges into a cylindrical duct (8.14) of greater cross sectional area than said orifice (7) and said pin (12) has a cylindrical form and enters said duct (8.14), when the closure cap is in a closure condition, to prevent the dispensing of container contents from said duct (8.14) and thereby from said metering orifice (7).   2.   h    combination as claimed in claim 1 in which the metering orifice (7) and the duct (8.14) are both concentric with the major axis of the container (c).   3. a combination as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the closure cap (1) engages an abutment surface   10)    to define a closure condition for said cap (1) on the container (c) and in said closure condition the pin (12) is spaced from said metering orifice (7).       q,    a combination as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 in which the container (c) includes a neck part (3), the neck part (3) is closed by a closure (2) and said metering orifice (7) and duct (8.14) are formed in said closure (2).      5.    a combination as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 in which the closure cap is a screw cap and engages with a thread on the container before the pin (12) enters the duct (8).     6.   h    combination as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 including an applicator device located to receive container contents dispensed from the duct (8).
