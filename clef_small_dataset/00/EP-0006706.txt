<ABSTRACT>
a semiconductor device may include an insulating  film (12) as a gate insulation film of a misfet, a dielectric  of a capacitor, a passivation film, and as a mask for selec­ tively forming its circuit elements.  according to this invention an isulating film (12) in a  semiconductor device is formed by nitriding at least a sur­ face portion (15) of a silicon dioxide film (12).  the nitrided silicon dioxide film is more dense than a  silicon nitride film deposited from the vapour phase and,  in addition, no sharp interface is formed between the nitri­ de layer and the dioxide layer so that the number of re­ combination centres is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a process for producing a semiconductor device according to the first part of claim 1. such a process is known from ibm-technical disclosure bulletin, vol. 19, no.3, aug. 1976, p.905. materials that have been used as insulating films in silicon semiconductor devices in the past include silicon dioxide (sio₂), silicon nitride (si₃n₄) and silicon oxynitride (sioxny). silicon dioxide is usually formed by a thermal oxidation of the silicon substrate or cvd or controlled vapour deposition process and thus, is inherently not dense. silicon nitride has always been formed by cvd (chemical vapor deposition) process or by directly nitridating silicon. silicon oxynitride has been formed by a cvd process using nh₃, o₂ and sih₄ gases. it is also known to use a double film, wherein alumina (al₂o₃), silicon nitride or a mixture of al₂o₃ and si₃n₄ is applied or laminated on a silicon dioxide film. the known insulating single or double film is, however, unstable during the production or operation of the semiconductor device, and does not have a dense structure. furthermore, it is inevitable that an interface is caused between the insulating film and the silicon substrate when it is applied by the cvd process. in a further known cvd process for producing silicon oxynitride, monosilane (sih₄), ammonia (nh₃) and oxygen (o₂) are brought into reaction with each other at a temperature of, for example, 700°c; see also fr-a- 2 223 836. the molar ratio of ammonia with respect to oxygen may be varied or changed gradually during the cvd period. however, the silicon oxynitride produced by this cvd process possesses structural defects. the inventors of the present invention believe that the structural defects are caused by the fact that intermediate reaction products of the cvd reaction are incorporated into the insulation film. a further disadvantage of the cvd process mentioned above is that it is difficult precisely to adjust the thickness of the silicon oxynitride film, and to form a film having a thickness of 10 nm or less. it is well known in the field of semiconductor devices to use silicon dioxide (sio₂) as an insulating film on a semiconductor silicon substrate. since the semiconductor device is required to operate both reliably and stably for a long period of time, contamination of the semiconductor substrate surface, which is believed to be the major reason for deterioration in its reliability, is prevented by covering the surface of the semiconductor substrate with a silicon dioxide film. silicon dioxide is the insulating material which is most frequently used for such covering, namely for surface passivation. it is also known that a single film of silicon dioxide cannot effectively prevent the surface of the semiconductor substrate from being contaminated by contaminants, such as moisture or sodium ions, from outside the semiconductor device. accordingly, an upper film of alumina (al₂o₃) is sometimes applied on the film of silicon dioxide. instead of the alumina film, a phosphorus glass layer, a boron glass layer or a lead glass layer may
