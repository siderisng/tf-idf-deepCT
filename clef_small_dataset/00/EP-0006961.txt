<ABSTRACT>
phenethylamine compounds useful as anti-phlogistic,  anti-arthritic, anti-pyretic and analgesic agents, of formula i    wherein r₁ is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, (c₁₋₄) alkyl,  (c₁₋₄)alkoxy, (c₁₋₄)alkylthio, lower acyloxy or lower  acylamino, r₂ is (c₃₋₈)cycloalkyl or a phenyl radical, r₃ is  hydrogen or (c₁₋₄)alkyl, r₄ and r₅ are the same or different and  are hydrogen, (c₁₋₄)alkyl or (c₇₋₁₁)phenylalkyl, or r₄ and r₅,  together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bound,  form a 1-pyrrolidinyl, piperidino or morpholino radical, or r₄  and r₅ together form a hydrolysable methylene moiety and r₆  is hydrogen or a hydrolysable acyl radical, and a process for  their production which comprises reducing a compound of  formula ii    in which r₁ to r₆ are as defined above, and where required  appropriately acylating any resulting product having a free  hydroxy or amino group and or condensing any resulting  compound wherein r₄ and r₅ are hydrogen with an appropriate  aldehyde or ketone.

<DESCRIPTION>
new phenylethylamines, process for their preparaticn, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them the present invention relates to new phenyl ethylamines, their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. in accordance with the invention there are provided ne compounds of formula i emi1.1 wherein r is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, (c1-4)alkyl, (c1 4)alkoxy, (c1 4)alkylthio, lower acyloxy or lower acylamino, r2 is (c3-8)cycloalkyl or a phenyl radical, r3 is hydrogen or (c1 4)alkyl, r4 and r5 are the same or different and are hydrogen, (c1-4)alkyl or (c7-11)phenylalkyl, or r4 and r5, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bound, form a 1-pyrrolidinyl, pipeidino, or morpholino radical, or r4 and r5 together form a hydrolysable methylene moiety and r6 is hydrogen or a hydrolysable acyl radical. any alkyl, alkoxy or alkylthio radical mentioned herein has preferably 1-2 carbon atoms or espe- cially one carbon atom. halogen means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. when r1 is halogen, this is preferably chlorine or bromine or especially chlorine. when r1 is lower acyloxy or lower acylamino, the acyl moiety may be derived from an aliphatic carboxylic acid containing up to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 2 carbon atoms. r1 is preferably halogen or alkyl. r1 is conveniently para with respect to the group or6. when r2 is cycloalkyl, this is preferably cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, especially cyclohexyl. when r2 is a phenyl radical this is conveniently an unsubstituted phenyl radical or a phenyl radical containing one or more substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, nitro, amino, trifluoromethyl, (c14)alkyl and (c1-4)alkoxy. preferably only one substituent is present, conveniently in the para position of the phenyl radical. preferably the substituent is selected from halogen, preferably chlorine or fluorine, alkyl or alkoxy. r2 is preferably a phenyl radical, especially an unsubstituted phenyl radical. preferably r3 is hydrogen. when r4 or r5 is phenylalkyl, this preferably contains 7 or 8 carbon atoms or especially 7 carbon atoms. conveniently,r4 and r are the same or 5 different and are hydrogen, (c1 4)alkyl or (c7-11) phenylalkyl, or toget!ier with the nitrogen atom to which they are bound, form a 1-pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, or morpholino radical. r4 and r5 are preferably the same, and are each preferably alkyl or more preferably hydrogen. when r4 and r are different, r is desirably hydrogen. when r4 and r5 together are -a hydrolysable methylene moiety, this is a physiologically acceptable hydrolysable moiety, which may be substituted, e.g. alkylidene, cycloalkylidene or arylalkylidene. it is to be appreciated that the compound may be a compound of formula i wherein r4 and r5 are each hydrogen in the form of a schiff's base. thus the radical may be derived from a non-toxic aldehyde or ketone and ray for example have the formula cr7 ? 8 wherein r7 and r8 are the same or different and are hydrogen, (c1-4)alkyl, a phenyl radical or z phenylalkyl radical, or r7 and r8 together are (c3-6)alkylene or (c3-6)alkenylene. the phenylalkyl radical may be phenylalkyl of 7 to 11 carbon atoms (ignoring any carbon containing substituents), unsubst
