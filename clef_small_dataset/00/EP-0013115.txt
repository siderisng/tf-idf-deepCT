<ABSTRACT>
a herbicidal combination comprising (1) a 2-sulfonyl  pyridine n-oxide of the formula    and (2) a 4-amino -6-tertiary butyl-3-(methyl thio) 1,2,  4-triazin-5 (4h) one having the structural formula  the combination is effective against grasses and broadÂ­ leaf weeds such as jimsonweed and morningglory.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
synergistic herbicidal composition certain sulfinyl and sulfonyl pyridine n-oxides are taught as being effective herbicides. see, for example, u.s. patent nos. 3,960,542, 4,019,893 and 4,050,921 incorporated herein by reference. similarly, certain triazinones in particular, 4-amino-6-(l,l dimethy lethyl)-3-methyl thio2-1,2,4-triazin-5(4h) one are useful as herbicides. see, for example, u.s. patent 3,905,801 incorporated herein by reference. the triazonone is particularly effective in control of weeds in soybeans and potatoes. however, this herbicide does not control grass as well and is also relatively ineffective against broadleaf plants such as jimsonweed and morningglory. it has surprisingly been found that 2-(1-(2,5, dimethylphenyl) ethylsulfonyl) pyridene n-oxide, when used in combination with 4-amino-6-(l,l-dimethylethyl)-3methyl thio-1,2,4,-triazin-5(4h)one, is effective against certain grasses and broadleaf weeds notwithstanding the fact that, when used independently neither compound shows this activity. the ratio of pyridine n-oxide to triazinone for effective results is about 0.5 to 1 to about 8 to 1. this invention relates to herbicidal compositions. in particular, @@ relates to a combination of 2-(1-(2,5,di- methylphenyl)ethylsulfonyl) pyridene n-oxide, with certain triazinones. the z ridene n-oxide useful in the practice of this invention has the general formula : emi2.1 the use and preparation of this compound is taught in u.s. patent 3,960,542 incorporated herein by reference. the triazinone suitable for use in the practice is 4-amino-6-tertiary butyl-3-(methylthic)1,2,3-triazin5(4h)one having the general formula: emi2.2 the preparation and use of this triazinone is taught in u.s. patent 3,905,801 incorporated herein by reference. as used in the syneryistic combination of this invention, the ratio of pyridine compound (hereinafter referred to as compound (i)) to triazinone compound (hereinafter referred to as compound (ii)) can be about 0.5 to 1 to about 8 to 1 preferably about 1 to 1 to about 4 to 1, e.g. 2 to 1. although the invention is described in terms of the activity of the n-oxide/triazinone combination in controlling jimsonweed and morningglory, the combination exhibits particularly broad and selective herbicidal activity in dicotyledonous crop cultures such as soybeans or potatoes. illustrative examples of the weeds which may be controlled include monocots such as fox tail species (setaria), panicum species (panicum), crabgrass species (digitaria3, barnyard grass (echinochloa crus-galli l. beauv.), goosegrass (eleusine indica (l.) gaertn), red rice (oryza sativa l.), johnsongrass (sorghum halepense (l.) pers.), wild oats (avena fatua l.) and dicots such as pigweed species (amaranthus), morningglory species (ipomea), jimsonweed (datura stramonium l.), common lambs quarters (chenopodium album l.), prickly sida (sida spinosa l), coffeeweed (daubentonia texana pierce), sickle pod (cassia obtusifolia l.), velvetleaf (abutilon theophrasti medic), mustard species (brassica), pennsylvania smartweed (polygonum pensylvanicun! l.) and common ragweed (ambrosia artemisiifolia l.). when used in its usual prior art application, the pyridine n-oxide (i) is applied at about one-half to about three pounds per acre; more preferably about onehalf to about one pound per acre. the triasinone (ii) is generally applied at about one quarter to about three quarters of a pound per acre. surprisingly, although compound (i) is the predominant component of the combination of this invention, the combination is effective when used at about
