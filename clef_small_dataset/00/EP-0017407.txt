<ABSTRACT>
a fuel burner capable of burning oil, gas or pulverised coal fuel is provided.  the burner is particularly suitable for large scale installations such as for steam boilers for power generation plants.  the burner provides a single main airstream which may be supplemented by a secondary gas flow.  the secondary flow may be of burnt gases so that flame temperature may be controlled to prevent production of pollutant nitrogen oxides.  -a novel burner fuel distribution nozzle is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a fuel burner, particularly a burner for use with multiple fuel sources. description of the prior art traditional design of oil-gas or coal fired boilerburners are designed on the basis that their individual performance in a multi-configuration firing can be measured by analysing the products of the combustion of all the burners as a whole, e.g. the measurement of o2 and/or co2 in the flue gas passages.. this design basis is in fact false as the traditional designs do not provide for the control or measurement of the fuel-air ratio of the individual burner, at any particular load on the boiler; and, in particular, do not include control measurement or calibrations for fuel-air ratios or load changes on the boiler which is a common problem when the boiler is associated with an electrical-generation system. by way of explanation the following are the facts: (i) multi-configuration boiler-burners are fitted with a common hot air duct which supplies hot "total" air in the case of oil and gas, and hot "secondary" air (e.g. usually 70% of "total" air) in the case of coal fired boilers. (ii) the common duct surrounds all the configuration of burners with hot air at varying pressures according to where the individual burner is situated in relation to the flow of air and also according to the adjustment of the dampers (e.g. usually vane type) of each burner, and also in accordance with the wear on these dampers and the pressure at the outlet of the burner throat. this pressure can vary with the state of the firing of the individual burner in relation to the others in the configuration. (iii) in traditional design ther-e is no individual accurate metering of the individual fuel flow to an individual burner in the configuration. such measuring as is done is normally done within the main fuel supply system to the boiler as a whole. (iv) in the case of coal, further adjustment problems of the fuel-air ratio arise in the traditional designs over and above gas and oil. these are that the fuel is carried to the burner after grinding by the primary air flow (25-30% of the total combustion air3. this causes the following problems in the fuel-air ratio: (a) the velocity of this primary air leaving the throat of the burner carrying the coal for combustion has a significant effect on the differential pressure between the burner throat and the air pressure in the burner box on the other side of the damper of the initial burner; (b) the primary air stream must be at a temperature so as not to cause combustion of the fuel that it is carrying, e.g. 0 around 170 f. whereas, the secondary air in the burner box is at full air heater temperature e.g. 500-540 f. any variations in these temperatures or the volumes of the primary or secondary air significantly upset the air-fuel ratio at the burner. additionally the differential temperature of primary and secondary air causes
