<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a textile laminate, a foamed mixture of a latex or a disvention of a polymer, containing thickener, optionally, in addition to conventional filling and additives, is applied to the surface of a textile substrate.For the purpose of improving the application process, air and a low viscous mixture containing a latex or a dispersion of a natural or synthetic polymeric sads in a high mixing speed zone is inserted under foaming of the mixture, an emulsion of a polymeric thickener injected into the mixing zone in a regulated amount whichThe mixing zone leaving foam applied to one side of a tissue substrate and the substrate subsequently laminates with a further layer of a tissue rate rials using the mixture.
