<ABSTRACT>
a method for accelerating the temperature adjust­ ment of a parison, particularly a parison used in a two-­ stage process, prior to its transformation into a finished  article by multiaxial expansion comprises: providing a  mold assembly including a parison mold cavity, a core  and a neck mold, all in communication with a source of  hot molten plastic under pressure, providing a parison  within said assembly, cooling said parison after its for­ mation by contact with said mold cavity, core and neck  mold, continuing said contact with said core only for a  relatively short time which is less than the time of con­ tact with the said cavity, and separating said core and  said parison from each other, such separation occurring  at a temperature of the parison which renders the sepa­ ration difficult without special means, whereby the said  means comprise a channel within said core which may  be closeable, said channel communicating with the inside  of the parison to provide access of fluid pressure to the  said inside thereby avoiding the formation of vacuum in­ side the parison while separating it from said core, main­ taining said fluid pressure during said separation, prefer­ ably while the parison is confined in the neck mold and  prevented from unduly deforming under the influence of  said fluid pressure, as by being confined, as in the said  mold cavity.
