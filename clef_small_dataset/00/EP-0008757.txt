<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a low-flow hot water system, it is proposed, in addition to the previously conventional cold water line and the hot water line containing a separate heater, a hot water line is preferably seen, through which the water is directed with the low flow temperature on the mixing battery of the hot water system. Preferably, in this case, in the mixing tap, the cold water is mixed with the hot water or the hot water with the hot water. A suitable mixing tap suitable for this purpose has a hot water supply in addition to the cold and hot water to a hot water supply and an inlet control (6; 7) to the mixing chamber (9) of the mixer tap, which only permits a mixture of hot and hot water and hot and cold water. The advantages of the specified method and the mixed tap specified there are particularly in the energy-efficient. Production of domestic water with a temperature lying between the temperature of the cold water and the temperature of the hot water.
