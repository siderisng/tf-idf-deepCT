<ABSTRACT>
a liquid crystal layer (18) is disposed between column  electrodes (14) and a matrix of cell electrodes (16).  row elec足 trodes (40,50,60) are associated with each row of the cell  electrodes.  an unstructured layer of varistor material (25) has  corresponding matrix zones connected by individual pin con足 ductors (30,39) in electrical series between each cell electrode  and its row electrode.  each liquid crystal cell is drivable bet足 ween its optical states by a voltage signal greater than the  sum of the liquid crystal threshold voltage and the varistor  breakdown voltage, and remains in the driven state due to its  inherent capacitance after removal of the driving voltage, to  permit multiplexing of the driving voltage signals to the dis足 play.  a high order of multiplexing (e. g.  1000) may be obtained  without provision of distinct non-linear devices associated  with each liquid crystal cell or row thereof.
