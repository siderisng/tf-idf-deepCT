<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a transaction execution system.   an embodiment of the invention provides a plurality of  transaction terminals (1) in communication with a host data  processing system (11).  the terminals each include a  keyboard (3), a display, document handling subsystems, a  hardware control subsystem, a communication subsystem  and a programmable control subsystem supervising the  other subsystems.  a user initiates a transaction request by  inserting a card, which may have been issued by any of a  plurality of cooperating card issuers or banks, into a card  reader (2) of the terminals.  the issuer identification number  (9) is read from the card, and used to search a table (8) of  card format and encryption key data.  if the corresponding  format and key data is located in the table, the terminal  requests entry of a preassigned personal id number (7)  through the keyboard.  verification data located on the card  by format data from the table is encrypted (5) in response to  the key data from the table for comparison (6) with the  keyboard entered id number.  if the corresponding format  and key data is not located in the table, the card data is sent  to the host (11), which accesses a master table (10) with the  issuer identification number, and communicates back to the  terminal the corresponding format and key data located in  the master table.  once the terminal has checked for correspondence  between encrypted verification data and the id  number, in response to format and key data from its own  table or communicated from the host, additional transaction  data is obtained via the keyboard.  upon command from the  host, the host supplied format and key data is purged by the  terminal at completion of the transaction, or else retained for  future reference.
