<ABSTRACT>
novel alcohols of the formula:    where r³ is hydrogen are useful intermediate compounds in  the preparation of insecticidal esters.  the insecticides are  compounds in which r⁵ is a substituted -vinylcyclop­ ropanecarbonyl group, a tetramethylcyclopropanecarbonyl  group, or a chlorophenyl- 2-methylpropylcarbonyl group.  the compounds are prepared by reacting a compound of  the formula:>

<DESCRIPTION>
nwel bicyclic alcohol and insecticida1 ester derivative their production, and cotsositions containing and insecticidal methods using tile esters the present invention ts directed to a novel alcohol for use in preparing cyclopropanecarboxylate and related insecticides, to insecticides employing this alcohol, to an insecticidal method and composition and to processes for production of the alcohol and its insecticidal esters. more particularly, the invention is directed to a 7-oxabicycloheptadienylmethanol and insecticidal esters therep. pyrethrins, naturally occurring extracts of chrysanthemum flowers, have long been of interest as insecticides. since elucidation of the structures of these compounds, synthesis efforts have been directed toward preparation of related compounds having enhanced insecticidal activity and improved stability toward air and light. since a prerequisite for insecticidal activity of pyrethroids is the presence in one molecule of an appropriate acid moiety and an appropriate alcohol moiety, research in the art has been directed toward novel acid and/or alcohol radicals. noteworthy advances in the area of alcohol research were the discovery of 5-benzyl-3-furylmethyl alcohol, then of the more photostable 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol. similarly significant advances have been made in pyrethroid acid research. the commercial insecticide permethrin, the common name for 3-phenoxyphenylmethyl 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2- dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, exemplifies use of both newer acid and alcohol moieties in a single compound. the present invention provides a novel bicyclic alcohol and certain ester derivatives thereof which have a high level of insecticid l activity. in this application, the term "lower" as applied to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group means having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 tp 4 carbon atoms, the term "halo or "halogen" means bromine chlorine or fluorine. the tcr3n 'haloalkyl" means an alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted with 1 or more halogen atoms and includes perhaloalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms. these definitions are applicable throughout the specification and claims except where a contrary meaning is clearly indicated. the novel compounds of this invention have the general emi2.1 wherein r1 is a hydrogen atom, a cyano group, an ethynyl group, a haloalkyl group, an aminocarbonyl group, or an aminothioxomethyl group; r2 and r3, the same or different, are nitro, halogen, cyano, lower alkyloxycarbonyl, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl, or the group -conr6r7 or -so2nr6r7 where r6 and r7 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, or halo(lower) alkyl; r4 is phenyl, benzyl, or benzoyl, optionally substituted with halogen or lower alkyl; r5 is hydrogen, 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropylcarbonyl, 1-(4-chlorophenyl) -2-methylpropyl-1-carbonyl, or a cyclopropanecarboxylic acid residue of the formula: emi2.2 wherein y and z, the same or different, are hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, haloalkyl, phenyl optionally substituted with halogen or lower alkyl, or phenylthio optionally substituted with halogen or lower alkyl. particularly useful insecticides of the present invention are the cyclopropanecarboxylates in which one of y and z is halogen, such as chlorine or bromine, and the other, the same or different, is halogen or a haloalkyl group such as trihalomethyl, r1 is hydrogen, r2 and r3 are each lower alkyloxycarbonyl, and r4 is benzyl. the cyclopropanecarboxylates having the acid residue of formula ii have
