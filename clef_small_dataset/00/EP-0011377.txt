<ABSTRACT>
an optical densitometer head adapted for application to  automatic equipment, and not requiring manual adjustment  of filters, comprises a housing (11) including a light source  (13), a lens system (15,17) and three photo-electric devices  (29,33), each with its own colour filter (25,27).  infra-red filters  may be included.  the outputs from the devices may be  applied to a three-channel amplifier (37) with a characteristic  so as to give outputs corresponding to the densities of the  three primary colours.  the devices may be symmetrically  disposed in the housing, and an inspection aperture, normally  closed by a plug may be provided.
