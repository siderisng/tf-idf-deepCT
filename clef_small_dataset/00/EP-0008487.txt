<ABSTRACT>
installation and method for the storage of thermal energy  and its supply when required.  the thermal energy may be  solar or be derived from industry.  for storage a pond (1) is  used which holds an aqueous saline solution whose concent­ ration and temperature decreases from bottom to top and  which is saturated at each level at the temperature there  prevailing.  solid solute (4) is provided at the bottom (3) of the  pond (1).  heat extraction is effected from solution at the bot­ tom region and may be effected by heat exchange within the  pond or by withdrawal of solution (5) from near the bottom of  the pond subjecting the withdrawn solution to heat exchange  outside the pond (46) and returning the solution and precipi­ tated solute to the pond.
