<ABSTRACT>
epitaxial and diffusion-type planar diodes and solar  cells utilize low-cost refined metallurgical silicon substrates  having a substantially higher impurity content than conventional  high-cost, high purity semiconductor grade silicon.   the epitaxial type products have an n-on-p-on-p substrate  configuration, while the diffusion-type products have pentavalent  impurities diffused therein to form a p-n junction  in the low-cost silicon substrate.  one embodiment employs  a multigrained refined metallurgical silicon (rms) prepared  by precipitating essentially iron-free silicon platelets from  a solution of metallurgical grade silicon in molten aluminium,  melting said refined platelets in contact with a silica slag  and pulling silicon boules from a melt of said refined metallurgical  silicon (rms).  by directionally solidifying the refined  silicon-slag melt, a multigrained, directionally solidified  refined metallurgical silicon (ds/rms) is obtained, with  boules being pulled from a melt thereof for use as said  low-cost substrate.  the ds/rms may also be re-melted and  directionally solidified a second time with the boules being  pulled from said twice directionally-solidified material being  a desirable low cost, single crystal material suitable for use  as said substrate for planar diode and solar cell applications.
