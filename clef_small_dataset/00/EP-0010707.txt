<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is apparatus and method for integrated,  continuous, high speed manufacture of metallic strip,  especially brass, from a melt.  the apparatus comprises a  chilled casting mold (11) in liquid communication with a  melt (12) and means for drawing a rod through the mold in  a pattern of forward and reverse strokes.  after emergence  from the mold, the rod (10) speed is regulated to a sub­ stantially constant value before conversion into strip.  in this  embodiment, the casting mold is stationary; the rod is  drawn through the mold by driven rolls programmed to  create the desired forward and reverse motion of the rod  through the mold.  creating substantially constant speed is  accomplished by allowing slack to develop through the la­ teral deflection of the rod.  in another embodiment, the  casting mold oscillates as the rod is withdrawn at a sub­ stantially constant speed so further rod motion regulation is  unnecessary.  conversion of the rod to strip comprises flat­ tening in a hot rolling mill (19), and quenching (20).  in ac­ cordance with known procedures the produced strip can  be further reduced in cross section in a cold rolling mill if  desired.
