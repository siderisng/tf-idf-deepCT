<ABSTRACT>
described are electrically conducting doped po­ ly(phenylene) compositions, preferably exhibiting conduc­ tivities greater than about 10⁻⁴ ohm⁻¹ cm⁻¹ as measured by  the four-probe method at room temperature.  preferred dop­ ants are group ia metal arenes, aa electron donor agents, and  arsenic pentafluoride as an electron acceptor agent.  semi-­ conductors and infrared absorber materials manufactured  from the compositions are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
description electrically conducting compositions derived from poly(phenylene) background of the invention 1. field of the invention this invention relates to electrically conducting compositions, useful as electronic and optical materials, comprising the solid polymer poly(phenylene) and electron donor or acceptor materials, or mixtures thereof. 2. brief description of the prior art the electronics industry is continuously searching for new and improved materials for fabricating electronic components. likewise, the plastics industry is in need of materials which have the property advantages of conventional organic polymers, but which are also electrically conducting. there is a special need in these industries for obtaining conducting materials exhibiting direct current conductivities of at least about 10 4 ohm 1 cm 1, and preferably greater than one ohm 1 cm 1, which also have the desired processibility, mechanical properties, low cost, and low density characteristics of carbon-backbone organic polymers. carbon backbone polymers, possessing conductive properties, can be prepared by pyrolyzing or graphitizing organic polymers. such resulting conductivity is most likely due to the formation of electrically conducting graphitic structures. however, such pyrolyzed or graphitized polymers are difficult to prepare in a controlled fashion, most likely exhibit undesirable variation in electrical properties, and are not conveniently processible. the only non-pyrolyzed non-graphitic carbonbackbone organic materials known in the art with conductivities as high as 104 ohm 1 cm 1 are complexes of unsubstituted polyacetylene, (-hc ch-)x, with specific electron donor or acceptor agents. this is currently the state of the art despite the fact that researchers have tried for over twenty years to obtain highly-conducting-complexes of earbonbackbone polymers. recent efforts in the field to discover substituted polyacetylenes which also form highly conducting complexes, comparable to those of unsubstituted polyacetylene, have not been successful. complexes of uncrosslinked polyacetylene with iodine, iodine chloride, iodine bromide, sodium, and arsenic pentafluoride having conductivities ranging from that of the undoped polymers to between 50 to 560 ohm 1 cm 1 at 2500 have been described in j. am. chem. soc. 100, 1013 (1978). also described therein are complexes of polyacetylene with hydrogen bromide, chlorine, and bromine having conductivities of up to at least between 7 x 10 4 and 0.5 ohm 1 cm 1, where the highest conductivity in this range is for the bromine complex. l. r. anderson, g. p. pez, and s. l. hsu in j. chem.-soc., chemical communications pp. 1066-1067 (1978) describe bistfluorosulfuryl) peroxide, fso 2ooso2f, as a dopant for polyacetylene to produce a composition having a room temperature conductivity-of about 700 ohm lem 1. also, the reference of j. chem. soc. chem. comm. pp. 489-490 (1978) reports that polyacetylene doped with agclo4 and agbf4 provides derivative materials having typical conductivities of up to 3 ohm cm 1 the possible application of polyacetylene complexes as electronic devices is described in app. phys. lett. 33, pp. 18-20 (1978). although such polyacetylene complexes are useful as electronic materials, they possess the disadvantages of environmental and thermal instability of the matrix polyacetylene. for example, even in the absence of oxygen, cis-polyacetylene transforms to trans-polyacetylene
