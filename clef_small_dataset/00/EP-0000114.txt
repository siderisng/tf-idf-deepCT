<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing an integrated logic circuit with bipolar transistors and integrated scarf device prepared according to this method. Method for simultaneizing two different transistors for I²l circuits on a single semiconductor tile, wherein the one type of circuits operates at low signal voltages and the other type of circuits operates as output driver stages at relatively high signal voltage. A vertically arranged NPN transistor of the white is usual with I²L circuits (integrated injection logic) is operated after upward injection, with a thinner epitaxially upgraded layer (50 ') between the buried subemitter (4') and the base zone. Built, as the thicker epitaxially growing layer (50) between buried subcollector (6 ') and the base zone down injecting vertical NPN transistor for output driver stages or input stages on the same semiconductor tile. If the thickness of the expitaxially raised layer is reduced at vertical transistors in I²l circuits injected upwards, then the charge memory characteristic of the constituent is reduced and the injection efficiency is increased. On the other hand, it increases the epitaxial layer thickness at vertical transistors injected downwards, as is used for output driving stages and input circuits of the semiconductor tile, then a higher signal voltage can be used because the base subcollector transition has a higher breakdown voltage. In this case, a method is given by which this structure can be prepared in which in the vertical transistors used above the buried subemitter (4 ') of a vertical transistor used in I²l circuit is introduced and thus increases the reactivity of the epitaxial surface for a subsequent oxidation reaction. by increasing the oxidation intensity in the epitaxial layer, a locally diluted zone can be formed, in which the basic and collector structures can be prepared using the same method steps using the same procedure used to form the basis and emitter structure in the output driving steps to be formed down injecting NPN transistors.
