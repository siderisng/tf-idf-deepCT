<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for determining the rheological properties of fluid consistent so much to fully fill a space between a body (1) constituted by an angle bicone at the top 2α, α being preferably less than 90 ° and a surfacebiconic (2) of the same axis as the axis of said angle bicone at the top 2 β, β being equal to or lower 90 °, and then the material is subjected to solicitations by interruption around the common axis of said bicone or said. saidbiconic surface, the non-entraining element remaining fixed, said driveway with a device by which one imposes, according to a known program, or a speed, or a torque to the entrance element, and the measurement is measured.The parameter, speed or torque, which is not imposed.It also relates to the apparatus for implementing said method.
