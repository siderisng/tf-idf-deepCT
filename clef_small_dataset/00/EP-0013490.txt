<ABSTRACT>
an output processor for an electronic musical instrument  is characterised by a data distribution network interconnect­ ing data processing means and data storage means, wherein  at least one such data storage means stores data from which a  waveform of the desired sound may be derived; means for  producing a plurality of microinstructions from which sets of  data flow control signals may be derived, said data flow con­ trol signals determining the source and destination of data  being handled by said distribution network; and means for  storage and retrieval of a program of said microinstructions,  said program effecting control of data flow in a manner such  as to allow the generation of the desired sound.  preferably  said program effects control of data flow in a manner which  allows the substantialiy simultaneous generation of a plural­ ity of waveforms.
