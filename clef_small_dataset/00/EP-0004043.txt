<ABSTRACT>
a process for removing acid gases such as co₂ and h₂s  from gas streams using an aqueous alkaline scrubbing solution  which is circulated between an absorption and regeneration  stage wherein the stripping steam for regeneration is  derived at least partly from the hot feed gas to be purified.   the thermal efficiency of the process is substantially  improved by first heat-exchanging the hot feed gas with the  scrubbing solution to raise stripping steam and then heat-exchanging  the hot feed gas with water (which is preferably  condensate water produced in the scrubbing process) in a  second heat exchanger operating under reduced pressure,  thus recovering additional low-level heat from the feed gas  and producing low-pressure steam which is compressed and  then utilized as additional stripping steam.  in a preferred  embodiment, additional low-pressure steam is generated by  also flashing off low-pressure steam from the regenerated  scrubbing solution and compressing this steam together  with the steam produced in the second heat exchanger for  use as stripping steam.
