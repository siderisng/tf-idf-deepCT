<ABSTRACT>
This heat exchanger for two fluids has in a closed cylindrical container (1) extending tubes for guiding the first fluid.The second fluid is guided in the outer space around the tubes.All supply and laxations are arranged in the lid (2) of the container.the tubes whose both ends in collecting pipes (9. 10) Mün the, near the container outer wall downwards and from there in the vicinity of the container axis upwards upwards, wherein both pipe sections (6a, 6b) by a MAN Tel (3) are separated.The jacket (3) is open to the container at the bottom of the container and above with a concentric about the inner collecting tube (10) arranged second tube (11) for carrying out the second fluid through the lid verbun.In addition, further tubes (12, 13) are arranged around the outer collecting tubes (9) and / or around the second tube (11) which are associated with the annular space between MAN Tel (3) and container wall.
