<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to screw extruders, especially cold  feed plastics extruders, in which an extruder screw (18) is  mounted for rotation in a bore (20) of a barrel portion (10, 14,  16).  the screw extruder comprises at least one roll mounted  for rotation adjacent an aperture (26) in the barrel portion  (10, 14, 16) so that a surface portion of the roll (24) restrains  material from leaving the barrel portion (10, 14, 16) through  the aperture (26) and heat transfer can be effected between  the material and the roll (24).  preferably there are two such  rolls (24), diametrically opposed and heated or cooled.  the  rolls (24) are rotated in the operation of the extruder, preferÂ­ ably by variable speed drive units (28), in carrying out a  method of effecting heat transfer according to one aspect of  the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
plastics or rubber extruders and methods of heat transfer therein this invention is concerned witb extruders, especially extruders for processing rubber or plastics materials, comprising a screw mounted for rotation in a bore of a barrel portion and screw driving means operat to rotate the screw to process material in the bore and to convey the material along the bore towards a discharge end of the bore. during the working of the rubber or plastics material in the bore and conveying of the material along the bore, heat is developed in the material owing to the work done on the material. to avoid overheating of the material during processing in the bore, part of the length of the barrel may be cooled to extract heat from the material in the bore. the rate at which heat can be extracted from material in the barrel is dependent on factors which include (i) the thermal conductivity of the material, (ii) the dwell time of the material in the cooled portion of the bore, (iii) the depth of the material layer (measured radially of the screw) adjacent the cooled wall of the barrel bounding the bore, (iv) the surface area of the cooled wall in contact with the material, (v) the degree of turbulence in the material being transported along the cooled portion of the barrel, (vi) the design of the extruder screw, and (vii) the rate at which the barrel itself can be cooled. the output of a screw-type extruder (by which is meant the rate at which processed material can be discharged by the extruder) is, from geometric considerations, dependent on the outside diameter of the screw, the flight depth, the screw pitch and the speed of rotation of the screw, and it would appear that greater and greater outputs could be achieved by employing larger and lager diameter screws. however, 2' screw diameter increases, the ratio or the surface area of 'g- wall tin contact with the material being processed, to the output of the extruder, decreases, n ir to be necessary to reduce the speed or rotation c iis scre; in order to increase the dwell time of the material in cooled portion of the barrel to prevent overheating of the material; thus the expected increased output (over extruders with smaller diameter screws) is not achieved. in order to achieve an improved performance from larger extruders (i.e. extruders with screw diameter of ore than about 150 mm.), especially in relation to cold- feed extruders (in which the material for processing is introduced into the extruder without being pre-heated), it is desirable to find a way of extracting heat, from material being processed, faster than can oe achieved simply by cooling the barrel of the extruder in a customary manner though there exists, particularly in relation to cold feed extruders, a requirement for cooling material more efficiently than is customarily possible sftmply by cooling the barrel, other circumstances may require heating of the material and it is one object or
