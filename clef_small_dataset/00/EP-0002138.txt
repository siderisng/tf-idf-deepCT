<ABSTRACT>
in or for a controller for electrical circuit systems and  apparatus, which controller is programmable with logic  instructions representative of circuit nodes of a ladder diagram,  a control system for wire number programming a  ladder diagram.  the control system comprises a manual  panel (2) into which may be plugged a read-write memory  m having a series of plural-bit data storage locations.  a  plurality of selector switches (f1s, f2s, f3s) are provided  and are settable to encode a contract program including the  input wire number to a contact, the contact number and  the output wire number from the contact, or the input wire  number to an output element and the output element number.   manually-controlled entry control means are provided  at (14, 8, 12) being operable to store the input wire number  code, contact number code and output wire number code  (or input wire number code, a special code indicative of  an output program and the output element code) in successive  storage locations in the memory.
