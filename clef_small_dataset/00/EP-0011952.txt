<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for testing enclosed electromagne­ tic relays (14) includes a probe (17) displaceable into the relay  enclosure to engage the movable contract (14b) thereof.  the  probe is associated with a force transducer (16) and a displace­ ment transducer (20) which provide inputs to a circuit including  microprocessor unit, which operates to detect the probe force  required to break contact between the movable contact (14b)  and the normally closed contact, and to detect the position of  the probe when such break occurs and when the normally open  contact is made and to calculate the contact travel from the  position signals it receives.  contact over travel is also measured  by applying current to the relay winding and measuring probe  displacement required to re-engage the contact.
