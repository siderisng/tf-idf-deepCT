<ABSTRACT>
there are provided orthopedic casts, splints, and the  like, for use on a portion of a human or animal body, which  are produced from a crosslinked copolymer of a lactone  monomer and a polyfunctional acrylate monomer.  the crosslinked  copolymer, in the form of a sheet, web, bandage, etc. ,  and, optionally, a supportive substrate, is heated above the  softening point of the copolymer, manipulated to conform to  the body portion, and cooled to a rigid state.  in one embodiment, there is provided a bandage material,  convertible to a rigid, porous, light-weight orthopedic  cast, which comprises a substrate in the form of a netting,  having on the surfaces of its strands a coating of the  aforementioned crosslinked copolymer.  the bandage material  is heated to a temperature at which the crosslinked  copolymer is soft and self-adherent and is then wrapped  around the body portion in a series of overlying layers so as  to conform to the contours of the body portion.  the overlying  layers are fused together to form a close-fitting unitary  cast and are then cooled to a rigid state.
