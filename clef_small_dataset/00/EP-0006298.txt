<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns new topical anti-inflammatory  1-phenyl-2-aminoethanol derivatives of the general formula:   r¹·ch(oh)·ch₂nh·cr²r²·a¹·nh[co·y·nh]n·q   wherein r¹ is a radical of formula    in which w¹ is a (2-12c)alkanoyloxyradical, one of w² and  w³ is hydrogen and the other of w² and w³ is a (2-12c)-­ alkanoyloxyradical and a² is a direct bond or a methylene  diradical, or r¹ is a phenyl, 2-chlorophenyl or 3,5-dichloro-­ 4-aminoradical, r² and r³ are independently hydrogen or  (1-4c)alkyl, a¹ is a (1-4c)alkylene, y is a (1-4c)alkylene  optionally bearing a (1-4c)alkyl or benzyl, n is an integer  from 1 to 4, and q is an optionally substituted benzoyl,  phenylacetyl, or phenoxyacetyl provided that when n is  other than 1, y in the individual diradicals of the formula  [co·y·nh] may have the same or different values, or to­ gether with the acid-addition salts thereof; and the pharma­ ceutical compositions thereof, for use in the treatment of  inflammatory skin diseases and conditions.  the invention  also concerns processes for the manufacture of derivatives  of formula i.  a representative compound of the invention is 1-[3,4-­ bis(pivaloyloxy) phenyl]-2-{2-[(n-benzoylglycyl)amino]-1,1-­ dimethyl-ethylamino)ethanol.
