<ABSTRACT>
a coupling unit, for example, for automatic irrigation  apparatus, comprises a probe (32) arranged to connect  within a mouth (33) of a hydrant to receive a water supply  from the supply line (b) connected to the hydrant.  the  probe (32) is mounted on a chassis (14).  the chassis has  two wheels (10) by means of which it rides on an upper  surface of the supply line (b) and guide wheels (12) which  engage the side to the supply line (b) so that the coupling  unit will follow the supply line (b).  the chassis (14) is also  supported from a steering head (28) and a flexible coupling  including a bearing (29) and a jack (31), permits limited  relative movement between the probe (32) and the steering  head (28) to accommodate misalignment of the probe  (32) with the mouth (33) of the hydrant.  in an alternative  embodiment the probe (32) is flexibly mounted on the  chassis (14) which is fixed.  in both embodiments a sensing  mechanism (60) enables the probe (32) to be tilted relative  to the hydrant.
