<ABSTRACT>
a coating composition comprising   (a) a monomer mixture of 30 to 90% by weight of at  least one poly(meth)acrylate of mono or polypentaeryth­ riol having at least three (meth)acryloyloxy groups in one  molecule of the formula (i)    wherein at least three of x₁₁, x₁₂, x₁₃, x₂₂, x₂₃. . . xn2,  xn3 and x₁₄ are ch₂=ch-coo- groups and the rest of  them of -oh groups, n is an integer of 1 to 5 and r repre­ sents hydrogen or a methyl group, and 70 to 10% by weight  of at least one monofunctional acrylate or methacrylate  having at least one ether bond in one molecule, a boiling  point above 150°c under normal pressure and a viscosity  below 20 centipoises at 20° c;   (b) 0. 01 to 10 parts by weight of a photosensitizing  agent per 100 parts by weight of a said monomer mixture;   (c) 0. 0001 to 2. 0 parts by weight per 100 parts by  weight of said monomer mixture of at least one silicon type  surface active agent of the formula (ii) or (iii):    m and n are positive integers being smaller than 200 and x  and y represent 0 or positive integers being smaller than  200 and satisfy the formula     and r₁ rep­ resents -h or an alkyl, acyl or aryl group having 1 to 6 car­ bon atoms or
