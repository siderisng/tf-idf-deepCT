<ABSTRACT>
the adjustable tripod has its three legs (5, 6, 7) attached by hinge pins (13) to a sleeve (2) with a locking handle (45), with a ring (1) on top of the sleeve which enables the legs to be set at two alternative angles.  the sleeve has a collar (3) round the top, from which extend downwards three ears (4) for the hinge pins.  this sleeve has a shoulder around the top over which the ring is fitted.  the ring has a cup shaped base (19) fitted with a cover (20).  screws (41) pass through the cover to clamp the base onto the sleeve, and a plate covers the screw heads.  the base incorporates alternative locating surfaces for the open ends of the legs.
