<ABSTRACT>
a torroidal oxy-fuel burner capable of operating on a low  pressure natural 985 supply comprises a barrel (101) (figure  2) having a conical opening (102) and a cone (103) which is  disposed in the conical opening and defines one wall of a  conical passageway (104) extending between the cone (103)  and the conical opening (102).  in use, oxygen is passed  through the passageway (104) and natural gas is directed into  a fuel supply port (202,203) which is disposed radially outÂ­ wardly of the outlet of the passageway.  the oxygen leaving the conical passageway entrains the  natural gas from the fuel supply port and forms a torroidal  flame downstream of the cone.  the burner can be fired on other gaseous or liquid fuels if  desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to oxy-fuel burners (hereinafter referred to as "burners"). one of the most successful burners produced in recent times is diagramatically shown, in cross-section, in figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. this burner, which is commonly known as a torroidal burner, comprises a barrel 1 having a conical opening 2. a cone 3 is mounted in the conical opening as shown and defines one wall of a conical passageway 4 extending between the cone 3 and the conical opening 2. in use, oxygen is passed through the conical passageway 4 in the direction of the arrows 5. at the same time fuel, for example natural gas or oil, is introduced into the passageway 4 through an annulus 6 cut in the periphery of the cone 3 as shown. the resulting mixture leaves the conical passageway 4 through annular outlet 8 and is ignited. because of the geometry of the burner, the mixture passing through annular outlet 8 tends to flow in the direction indicated by the arrows 7 which causes the burning mixture to adopt a very distinctive torroidal shape. this type of burner has two major advantages, viz 1. it can be fired over a very large range of heat outputs since the higher the flow through the passageway 4 the more the torroidal flow pattern tends to move towards the cone, there by inhibiting flame lift off; and 2. the flame is very broad compared with most burners. this second advantage is particul arly important where the burner is being fired on a mixture of oxygen and fuel since such flames tend to be very narrow. despite its advantages the torroidal burner has several disadvantages. one is that the minimum pressure in the passageway 4 must be about 12.5 psig in order for the torroidal flow pattern to form efficiently. this means that the fuel in annulus 6 must be raised to just over 12.5 psig before it can be injected into passageway 4. whilst this coes not create any problems for liquid fuels, for example oils, a large and expensive compressor is needed when the fuel is natural gas which, with few exceptions, is generally only available at low pressure, i.e. 8 to 10 inches water cauge (i.e. approximately 31 psig). many attempts have been made to operate torroidal burners with low pressure natural gas but, to our knowledge, all such attempts have failed. we have now found that a torroidal burner can be modfired to operate successfully on low pressure natural gas. according to the present invention there is provided a burner comprising a barrel having a conical opening, a cone disposed in said conical opening and defining one wall of a conical passageway extending between said cone and said con cal opening, and at least one fuel supply port disposed radially outwardly from the outlet of said conical passageway, the arrangement being such that, in use, oxygen leaving said outlet entrains fuel from said fuel supply port and orms a torroidal flame downstream

 claims   1. a burner comprising a barrel having a conical opening, a cone disposed in said conical opening and defining one wall of a conical passageway extending between said cone and said conical opening, and at least one fuel supply port characterized in that at least one fuel supply port is disposed radially outwardly from the outlet of said conical passageway, the arrangement being such that, in use, oxygen leaving said outlet entrains fuel from said fuel supply port and forms a torroidal flame downstream of said cone.    2. a burner according to claim 1, characterized in that said fuel supply port comprises an annulus surrounding the outlet of said conical passageway.   3. a burner according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said fuel supply port communicates with a passage which is inclined towards the longitudical axis of said burner downstream of said cone.   4. a burner according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that it includes an air supply port situated radially outwardly from the outlet of said conical passageway.
