<ABSTRACT>
in the manufacture of an infra-red radiation detector ele­ ment (51) a body of infra-red sensitive material (e. g.  cadmium  mercury telluride) secured to a substrate (22) is subjected to  ion-etching to remove part of the material over the whole  thickness of the element (51) at areas (56) between the contact  areas of the element electrodes (35 and 36b) so as to define a  current path between these electrodes (35 and 36b) which  extends through the remaining material and is longer than the  distance along a straight line between the electrodes (35 and  36b).  this longer current path increases the charge-carrier  transit time and resistance between the electrodes (35 and  36b) so that the responsivity of the detector element (51) can  be improved while still producing a compact element struc­ ture because of the advantages of defining the current path by  ion-etching.  this etch-removal may involve forming parallel  slots (56) which extend from opposite side walls of the ele­ ment (51) to define a meandering current path, and may addi­ tionally be used to form a mutual separation (55) between  portions (51 and 52) of the body each of which is to form a  separate infra-red detector element of an array formed on the  substrate (22).  it is suggested that figure 16 should accompany the abs­ tract when published.
