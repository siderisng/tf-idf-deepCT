<ABSTRACT>
a microprocessor (16) for executing computer pro足 grams (12) which are stored (12) in cipher to prevent soft足 ware piracy.  such a crypto-microprocessor (16) deciphers  (4) the enciphered program (12) piecemeal as it executes  it (67), so that a large enciphered program (12) can be se足 curely executed without disclosing the deciphered program  or associated data to persons who have access to the  wiring of the computer in which the crypto-microprocessor  (16) is a component.  various methods of deciphering may  be used including methods which result in the cipher of  a byte being a complex function of the byte's address in  memory.  each crypto-microprocessor chip (16) may use  a unique cipher key (5) or tables for deciphering the pro足 gram (12), so that a program that can be executed in one  chip cannot be run in any other microprocessor.
