<ABSTRACT>
a method for forming a film is disclosed which is consti­ tuted essentially of iodides of heavy metals to which catal­ ysts or sensitizing agents are added to make the film highly  sensitive to light and current at room temperature, thus  increasing the speed of writing and erasing cycles.  the dis­ closure provides for producing and erasing images on such  light and current sensitive film prepared on substrates such  as ordinary paper or transparent non-reactive materials.   marking on the film is achieved by light e. g. , laser beam and  xenon lamp, or electrical current.  exemplary erasing is done  by application of heat.  several examples are disclosed of the  formation of such film adhering to non-reactive surfaces.
