<ABSTRACT>
an adjustable v-belt comprises a compressive rubber  layer (2) onto which an adhesion rubber layer (3) is  laminated, the adhesion rubber layer (3) having a plurality of  ridges (4) on a surface thereof remote from the compressive  rubber layer (2) which extend transversely of the v-belt.  a  canvas covering (5) covers the ridges (4) and the recesses  defined therebetween, and is stretchable longitudinally of  the v-belt.  elongate tensile portions (6) are embedded  between the adhesion rubber layer (3) and the ridges (4) so  that they contact portions of the canvas covering (5) which  are disposed in said recesses.  the tensile portions (6) extend  longitudinally of the v-belt in mutually parallel, equi-spaced  relation, and have a differential thermal contraction stress  between 100°c and 20°c of at least 3. 5g/denier.  at least one  ply of rubberized canvas (7) or a rubber sheet can be  laminated onto a surface of the compressive rubber layer (2)  remote from the adhesion rubber layer (3), and short fibres  (8) can be embedded in the compressive rubber layer (2) so  as to be oriented transversely of the v-belt.  the v-belt is  manufactured by winding the canvas covering (5), the tensile  portions (6), the adhesion rubber (3a), the compression  rubber (2a) and the rubberized canvas (7) in succession  around an outer wall of a cylindrical metal mould (11) which  has circumferentially spaced protrusions (12) extending  axially thereof.  the tensile portions (6) are formed by spirally  winding a rope-like tensile member around the mould (11),  the tensile member being subjected to a thermal elongation  treatment.  the resultant belt blank is then pressurized and  heated, causing some of the adhesion rubber (3a) to flow  between the windings of the tensile member (6) and into  grooves (13) defined between the protrusions (12), thereby  forming the ridges (4) in the finished v-belt.
