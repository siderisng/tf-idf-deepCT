<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for dehydration of air the present invention relates to an apparatus for dehydration of air. more particularly it concerns wet process continuous dehydration of atmospheric air so that it is suitable for supply to a blast furnace. it relates to such an apparatus in which a large volume of air required for use in the operation of a blast furnace may be processed by bringing it into contact with regenerative hygroscopic liquid so as to reduce the moisture content of the air to a level not higher than a predetermined level throughout the year. more particularly, it relates to such an apparatus in which the regeneration of the hygroscopic liquid can be carried out precisely and effectively in accordance with the change in the atmospheric conditions owing to the change of the seasons, and which can provide dehydrated air of a reduced moisture content not higher than a predetermined level, irrespective of the seasons of the year, at the cost of low energy consumption. as well known in the art, fuel consumption required in operation of a blast furnace decreases if the furnace is allowed to operate with air of a reduced moisture content. it is also known that for stable operation of the. furnace it is essential to minimize variations in the moisture content of air supplied to the furnace. various processes and apparatus have heretofore been proposed for dehydration of air to be supplied to a blast furnace. they may be classified into two types of technology, one type in which compressed air is dehydrated at the output side of a blower, as disclosed in japanese laid-open patent application no. 69406/1976 (japanese examined patent publication no. 44724/1977), and the other type in which atmospheric air is dehydrated at the input side of a blower, as disclosed in japanese laid-open patent application no. 61056/1974. generally, the dehydration process is carried out in both types using a regenerative hygroscopic agent which may be in the form of solid or liquid. in dehydration of air at the output side of the blower, a stream of compressed air must be processed which normally has a pressure of 3 to 5 kg/cm2 gauge and a temperature of 150 to 2500c, and therefore, strong, durable and complicated instruments are required. furthermore, it is technically difficult to use liquid hygroscopic agents which are less expensive in both initial installation and maintenance costs. dehydration of atmospheric air at the input side of the blower is technically less difficult than dehydration of compressed air at the output side of the blower, and may be carried out using inexpensive liquid hygroscopic agents. in this case, however, the change in the temperature and humidity of intake atmospheric air poses a serious problem. this is especially true in those areas where the atmospheric conditions vary to a great extent with the change in the seasons of the year. the dehydration process must be suitably varied in response to the change in the atmospheric conditions, or otherwise it is impossible
