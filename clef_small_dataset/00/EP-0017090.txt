<ABSTRACT>
character recognition apparatus detects baseline of a  line of characters as an aid to segmentation in a recognition  processor (16).  the characters may include underlined  characters, characters of different height, characters extend足 ing below the baseline, and characters with subscripts.  a line  of sensor elements of a scanner (11) makes vertical scans  successively along a line of characters.  the lowest character  parts occurring in a narrow band or search window extend足 ing along the line of characters and including the baseline  are determined by logic circuitry (26 to 29), and by a search  window selection circuit (31), responsive to a coarse baseline  prediction derived from character part histograms, each for a  respective group of characters along the line.  a histogram  generator (13) develops the histograms.  the search window  technique excludes underlinings from baseline determina足 tion.  averaging circuits (32) determine baseline from the  determined lowest character parts.  excessive coarse base足 line skew prediction is recognised by the processor (16) and  operation of the apparatus is halted to allow document  repositioning.
