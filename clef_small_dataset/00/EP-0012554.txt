<ABSTRACT>
an automatically guided vehicle has a sensing head to  detect the position of a guide line (28) with respect to the  vehicle.  the sensing head includes a scanning head (58) to  scan across the guide line (28) and to generate signals repre­ sentative of the reflected light.  a control circuit is adapted to  steer the vehicle along the right edge, left edge or center of  the guide line (28) and is responsive to control codes posi­ tioned on the floor adjacent the guide line.  the control circuit  preferably includes a microprocessor having a data storage  bank for storing a data table relating to the position of the  vehicle with respect to the guide line and has the ability to  compare the data table for one scan with the data table of  subsequent scans to determine the presence of a valid guide  line and to update the position of the guide line with respect  to the vehicle.
