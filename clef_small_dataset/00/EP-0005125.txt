<ABSTRACT>
the present invention complements a previous invention  on a self-aligned process for mesfet transistors.  after  the gate electrode (11) is defined, leaving a very fine gap in  between the ohmic (12) and the gate contacts, the different  etch rate of the two contacts with respect to ion etching is  exploited in order to increase the separation in the pad  region.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvement in a method for manufacturing cemiconductor devices descr i pt i the present invention relates to an improvement in manufacturing semiconductor devices. in the united states patent no. ', 0s 712 by the same inventor, a process is described for manufacturing mes-fet transistors with self-aligned schottky barrier gate electrodes. once the gate electrode is fabricated with the process described in the abo ve mentioned patent, th problem arises of defining the geometry of the ohmic contacts representing the source and drain contacts. the geometrical definition of such contacts, generally made by layers of au, ge, nicr or an alloy of au and ge, is not trivial insofar as the ma terials forming the ohmic contacts can not be easily etched by wet chemi stry while the gate electrode, made of al, can be very easily etched. the present invention relates to a process whereby the geometry of the abo ve mentioned ohmic contacts is shaped without any appreciable damage to the gate electrode previous defined. the present invention makes use of ion milling or sputter etching and exploits the relatively high ratio between the etching rate of the material forming the ohniic contact (tipically au-ge) and the material forming the gate eec trode (tipically alj, relative to ion etching. again, according ro this invention, such ratio of the etching rates can be increased by the #ddition of reactive gases to the armosphere of the etching chamber (e.#. oxygen in the case of al vs au). the present invention will be now described in connection with a preferred enbodiement with reference to the enclosed drawings. however it will be understood that such description is only meant as an illustrative but not limitative examplt. figure 1 and 1a show respectively a view from the top and a cross section of a tipical semiconductor device to be processed according to this inventior. figure 2 and 2a show, respectively, a view from the top and a cross section of the device at an intermediate stage in processing according to this invent ion. figure 3 and 3a show, respectively, a view from the top and a cross section of the device after the process is completed according to this invention. \sith reference to fig. 1 and la the dex e is shown at a given stage in its fabrication drocess; the semiconductor wafer e.g. zas is shown after a gate electrode, made e.g. of aluminum, has been defined e.g. according to the prcess described in u.s. patent no. 4 , 018, 712. the gate electrode 11 is surrounded by an ohmic contact metallization 12, made e.g. of au-ce, which must be selectively etched in order to define two separate areas, constituting the source and drain electrodes, when this process is performed in the fabrication of a f.e.t. next, with reference to fig. 2 and 2a, a layer of masking material (e.g. photoresist of suitable thickness) 13 is deposited over the portion of oh mic contact to be preserved, as well as a portion of
