<ABSTRACT>
polyurethane resins are prepared by reacting a high sol­ ids polyol-containing component with an isocyanate-­ containing component.  the polyol-containing component  comprises the condensation product of a) from about 70 to  about 90 parts by weight castor oil and b) from about 5 to  about 20 parts by weight pentaerythritol, and, preferably, c)  from about 5 to about 30 parts by weight of a condensation  agent having a molecular weight of less than about 400 and  selected from the group consisting of polycarboxylic acids  having up to about 4 carboxyl groups, methyl and ethyl esters  of such polycarboxylic acids, and combinations thereof.  the  solids content of the polyol-containing component is at least  about 60% by weight.  the resins are used for the preparation of coatings.
