<ABSTRACT>
when particulate material (52) reposing on a support or  base (51) is to be carried off in an upward direction by means  of a vertical conveyor (21) whose lower inlet end portion is  vertically and laterally movable, there is a problem involved in  the carrying-off of the final, small layer of material on the base  and material in recesses and nooks, for example, in the cargo  holds of a vessel, which cannot be reached directly by the inlet  end portion of the vertical conveyor.  this problem has been  solved by means of the final unloading apparatus according  to the present invention.  this apparatus is provided with a  sleeve (31) which is adapted to be disposed about the inlet end  portion of the vertical conveyor (21), an elongate feed conÂ­ veyor (39) which has a discharge end in communication with  the interior of the sleeve and is journalled on the sleeve in  such a manner that the feed conveyor is pivotal in a plane  parallel to the axis of the sleeve, and an elongate collector (44)  disposed transversely of the feed conveyor and journalled  thereon, the collector being pivotal in a plane transverse to the  longitudinal axis of the feed conveyor and supplying material  to the inlet end of the feed conveyor.
