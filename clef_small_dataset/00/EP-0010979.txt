<ABSTRACT>
overcurrent protection circuitry for an electric motor  driving circuit (3) has an overcurrent detector (r₁, r₂, r₃, 10)  monitoring current (for example i₁) flowing to the motor (4).   the circuitry is such that when an overcurrent is detected  current delivery from the driving circuit (3) is interrupted (for  example through the operation of comparator 10a, resetting  flip-flops 93a, 93b, and through and gates 94a, 94b to turn off  current delivery transistors q₁ and q₂).  the circuitry then  operates so that current delivery is restored after the inter­ ruption (for example by pulses from pulse generator 96  acting to set flip-flops 93a and 93b).  upon such a restoration  if detector (10) still detects an overcurrent current delivery is  again interrupted (by resetting flip-flops 93a, 93b).  the result is that the drive circuit (3) is allowed to  supply current intermittently but not above a value preset in  the overcurrent detector even when the motor is overloaded,  thereby allowing the motor to run continuously without ob­ servable halt in operation.
