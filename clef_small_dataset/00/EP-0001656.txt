<ABSTRACT>
the cable supporting chain for machine parts moving in a  straight line consists of modular link elements (1) sequentially  assembled by means of a system of male and female joints at  the ends of each element.  these joints are formed by flanges  (5; 11a, 11b) of ellipsoid shape being much longer than the  central body portion of the element.  a system of cavities (10) and protruding fingers (16)  restricts the pivotal motion of the elements to the desired  radius of curvature of the chain.  the long ellipsoid flanges  efficiently protect the pivot point of the link elements so as to  prevent jamming of the chain by chips or other foreign matter  during the operation in the workshop environment.  the structure  of the cable supporting chain can be better seen from fig.   4 of the drawings.
