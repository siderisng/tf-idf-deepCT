<ABSTRACT>
an intravascular catheter, comprising a hub (2) having a  pair of axially spaced branched tubes (7,8) mounted thereto,  a flexible double-walled tube (3) having an inwardly tapered  tip portion (21) and consisting of coaxial inner (13) and outer  tubes (16) and a needle (4) removably inserted into said inner  tube.  the base edge of the inner tube (13) is located intermediately  between the positions from which said two  branched tubes (7,8) extend outward so that the inner passageway  (15) of tube (13) after removing of needle (4) communicates  with the branched tube (8).  the base edge of the  outer tube (16) is fixed to the tip of the hub (2) so that the  annular passageway (20) formed between said outer and  inner tubes (13,16) communicates with the other branched  tube (7).  the inner passageway (15) has an opening at the  tapered tip (21) of the double-walled tube (3) and the forward  end portion of the outer tube (16) is provided with bores  (23,24) at its connection with the tapered tip portion (21).
