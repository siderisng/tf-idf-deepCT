<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a process in which  effective colour stabilisation of polyvinyl chloride is achieved  by incorporating during vinyl chloride polymerisation a very  small quantity (0. 005 to 0. 04% by weight) of an acyl  acetophenone stabiliser of the formula:   wherein r represents an alkyl or aryl group optionally  substituted by a carboxyl group, or an alkylene group linking  with another 3-phenyl-1,3-oxopropyl moiety, and  subsequently blending the resulting polyvinyl chloride with  one or more divalent metal carboxylates.

<DESCRIPTION>
"process for the preparation of colour stabilised vinyl chloride dolymers" this invention relates to a process for stabilising a vinyl chloride polymer against colour deterioration by the use of aromatic beta diketones such as dibenzoyl methane and stearoyl benzoyl methane, and to shaped articles manufactured from such stabilised polymers. in general, vinyl chloride polymers have poor thermal/colour stability. this is reflected in decomposition, discolouration and brittleness of the polymer when it is subjected to elevated temperatures through shaping operations, for example, through injection moulding, extrusion and bottle blowing machines. it is well known that certain organic salts of zine and calcium (such as their stearates) are effective thermal stabilisers which result in a good initial colour and brightness in the shaped material. these properties are important, for example, in the production of bottles from a polymer having a relatively low kvalue and good flow. however, the use of zinc and calcium organic salts as stabilisers does not always enable the most stringent commercial criteria to be met, particularly in processes such as bottle manufacture where it is customary to reprocess any bottles whose moulding is unsatisfactory. such reprocessing procedures thereby impose a repeated thermal stress on the recycled material and thus require an improved level of stabilisation. for technical and economic reasons, it is naturally desirable for any stabiliser to be utilised in the smallest proportion which will achieve the desired commercial result. also it is often convenient for the stabiliser to be added during the actual polymerisation, since the subsequent processing is thereby simplified by the reduction in the number and complexity of the additives to be incorporated. however, the suspension system used in the polymerisation of vinyl chloride calls for a precise balance of conditions, which can often be affected adversely by the presence of additional components, and hence it is often found impractical to incorporate the stabiliser during polymerisation. it is known from uk patent specifications 1,08h,578 and l,5ll,621 that acceptable stabilisation of polyvinyl chloride can be obtained by incorporating dibenzoyl methane or stearoyl benzoyl methane, in an amount of 0.1 or 0.05 to 5% by weight together with a metal carboxylate such as zinc or calcium stearate. the former specification gives no details on the procedures employed for the actual incorporation of the stabiliser into the polymer whilst the latter specification discloses that the stabiliser may be incorporated at the same time as the other additives, such as plasticisers, pigments and lubricants, either simultaneously or sequentially, suitable blending methods being through homogenisation in a mixer or kneader. thus the teaching of these documents is that stabilisation of pvc using diketones requires the pvc to be homogenised with at least 0.05%, by weight, of stabiliser. however, the applicants have now surprisingly found that aromatic beta diketone stabilisers may not only be incorporated during the polymerisation of the vinyl chloride monomer, but moreover their incorporation at this stage permits the attainment of satisfactory stability with significantly lower proportions of stabiliser. accordingly, the present invention provides a process for
