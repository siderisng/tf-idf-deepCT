<ABSTRACT>
an improved process for the preparation of the  methyl ester of 4-oxopentane-1-carboxylic acid by the  reaction of acetone with methyl acrylate.  the reactants  are reacted in a reaction zone in the presence of both a  primary amine and/or schiff base as catalyst, and an acid  compound to form a reaction mixture containing the  methyl ester.  the reaction mixture is distilled to form  a distillate containing unconsumed reactants and catalyst  and a residual liquid phase containing the methyl ester.  the distillate is recycled to the reaction zone, and  the methyl ester is recovered from the residual liquid  phase by a further distillation.  the amount of oxygen  dissolved in the reaction mixture is maintained at a level  below 20 parts by weight per million, and the distillation  of the reaction mixture is carried out at a temperature of  less than 195°c, at a pressure of at least atmospheric,  and in the presence of an inert solvent having a boiling  point of between 80 and 195°c.
