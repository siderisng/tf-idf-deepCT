<ABSTRACT>
a hydrophilic, water-containing regenerated cellulose  membrane is sequentially permeated under differential pres­ sure with solvents of decreasing polarity so as initially to dis­ place water in the membrane with a first solvent, and the or  each other solvent in the sequence displacing the previous  solvent.  each solvent has bulk liquid-liquid miscibility with the  adjacent solvent(s) in the sequence, and the final solvents of  the sequence exhibits bulk liquid-liquid miscibility with a mate­ rial ultimately desired to be selectively permeated through the  membrane.  the first solvent is a lower (c₁-c₄) alcohol or ace­ tone.  the resulting membrane is practically suitable for at  least partially separating, by permeation, a solvent used in de­ waxing a waxy hydrocarbon oil from a solution of the oil and  solvent.
