<ABSTRACT>
the invention is concerned with the reduction of the  vibration transmitted from a mechanism having at least  one element rotating at a fundamental frequency and one  or more cyclically displaceable further elements connected  to said rotating element, and in which the displacements  of said further elements produce an aggregate cyclic  linear exciting force of fundamental frequency and  harmonics thereof acting on the same line.  to prevent  transmission of vibrations produced by said exciting force  from the mechanism to its support means, the mechanism  is constrained to prevent all degrees of freedom of movement  relative to the support means except for movement  under the influence of said linear exciting force which is  thereby isolated from the support means.  the mechanism  also has balancing means integral with or attached to said  rotating element for balancing any rotating force produced  at said fundamental frequency.  low rate resilient suspension  means and damping means may also be connected  between the mechanism and the support means.
