<ABSTRACT>
a steering gear and a method of assembling such a  gear.  a rotatable rack bar (1) having helical rack teeth (5)  is displaceable along axis (2) by rotation of a pinion.  the  end of the bar (1) is connected to a tie rod (6) having a  ball end (7) forming a universal joint in housing (8).  a skirt  (14) of the housing (8) encloses a roller thrust bearing  (9) to which it is secured by peening or rolling a hem part  (14a) of the skirt over an outer race member (17) of the  thrust bearing.  a thrust plate (15) is interposed between a  plug (12) and the thrust bearing (9).  upon deformation of  the hem part (14a) to clamp the thrust bearing to the housÂ­ ing (8), the plug (12) is displaced into its bore against the  ball end (7) to provide desired preloading for the ball joint.   the inner race member (19) is secured to a shaft part (20)  of the rack bar (1).
