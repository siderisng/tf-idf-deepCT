<ABSTRACT>
an epoxy resin, useful for coating the internal surface(s)  of a reactor such as one used for vinyl halide, particularly vinyl  chloride, polymerisation in aqueous dispersion for the pur­ pose of suppressing build-up, is made by cross-linking (1) the  uncross-linked polyether intermediate of an epoxy resin, by  admisture with (ii) a product made from the reaction of (a) at  least one aliphatic amine containing two or more primary  aliphatic amino groups, (b) at least one aromatic amine con­ taining two or more primary aromatic amino groups, and (c)  at least one compound selected from oxo-group substituted  aromatic compounds and quinone-type compounds, wherein  the molar ratio (a):(b) is 4:1 to 1:3.
