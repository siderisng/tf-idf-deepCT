<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector assembly and apparatus for, and  a method of, manufacturing the assembly.  a "free standing" electrical connector assembly com­ prises a plurality of electrical terminals (12) each having a  contact portion (8) contained in an insulating housing (16) and  a terminal post (2) projecting from the housing (16) and hav­ ing an enlarged portion (not shown) for insertion in a hole (13)  in a printed circuit board (14).  the posts (2) are aligned in parallel relationship by means  of an insulating strip (18) through holes (13′) in which free  ends of the posts (2) extend.  the material of the strip (18) and  the thickness thereof are such that the enlarged portions of  the posts (2) can be forced through the holes (13′) in the strip  (18) and into the holes (13) in the printed circuit board (14).   apparatus (not shown) for, and a method of, manufacturing  the assembly are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
an electrical connector assembly and apparatus for, and a method of, manufacturing the assembly. this invention relates to an electrical connector assembly and apparatus for, and a method of, manufacturing the assembly. there is disclosed in united states patent specification no. 3,609,633, an electrical connector assembly comprising a plurality of electrical terminals each having an electrical contact portion and an electrical connecting post having a free end, an insulating housing enclosing the contact portions of the terminals and from which housing the connecting posts of the terminals project, the posts extending through holes in an insulating strip which serves to retain the posts in parallel relationship with one another, the terminals having enlarged portions intermediate their ends and the strip being positioned between the free ends of the posts and the enlarged portions. in this known assembly, the enlarged portions of the terminals serve as stops which limit the insertion of the posts of the terminals through the holes in the insulating strip which is in the form of an elastomeric block of considerable thickness. the present invention concerns the problem of aligning the connecting posts of a free standing electrical connector, according for example, to our united states patent specification no. 4,077,694 in which the posts are somewhat loosely confined by the housing, the base of which is constituted by a printed circuit board into holes in which the posts are inserted by the end user of the connector, the enlarged portions of the terminals being formed on the posts and being adapted to be force fitted into the holes in the printed circuit board to stabilize the terminals with respect thereto. since, as mentioned above, the terminals are somewhat loosely confined by the housing, the terminals tend, prior to the assembly of the connector to the printed circuit board, to shift relative to one another so that the posts do not extend from the housing in exactly parallel relationship with respect to one another, so that difficulty is experienced in inserting the posts into the holes in the printed circuit board. according to one aspect of the present invention, therefore, an electrical connector assembly as defined in the second paragraph of this specification is characterised in that the maleability of the material of the strip and the thickness thereof are such that the enlarged portions, which portions are adapted to be force fitted into holes in a printed circuit board, can be forced through the holes in the strip to lodge the enlarged portions in the holes in the printed circuit board. the insulating strip therefore serves to keep the posts in precise alignment prior to their insertion into the holes in the printed circuit board so that the assembly can be applied directly to the printed circuit board without first mutually aligning the posts. although there is disclosed in united states patent specification no. 3,793,720 an assembly of electrical circuit components e.g. resistors and capacitors, in which the leads of these components extend through an insulating support
