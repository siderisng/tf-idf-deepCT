<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a crankshaft positions transducer system for providing triggering pulses for an electronic ignition system.   <??>in a known system used with an internal combustion engine a single reference projection is mounted on the flywheel and a pair of transducers are mounted at circumferentially spaced locations on the flywheel housing.  this is inconvenient as space inside the flywheel housing is limited.   <??>in the present invention a pair of reference elements (34) are mounted at circumferentially and radially spaced locations on the flywheel (16) and a transducer head having two individual transducers (22, 24) is provided, each individual transducer (22, 24) co-operating with a respective one of the reference elements (34) to produce a triggering pulse.
