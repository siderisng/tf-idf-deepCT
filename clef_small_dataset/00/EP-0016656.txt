<ABSTRACT>
the seals of the windows, doors and boot of a vehicle  (11) are checked by creating a temperature difference, and  preferably a pressure difference also, between the interior  and the exterior of the vehicle and observing the location of  any leaks in the seals by monitoring the infra-red radiation  from areas around the seals so as to detect temperature  variations caused by air escaping through the leaks.

<DESCRIPTION>
testing vehicule seals this invention relates to tile testing of vehicle seals. such seals, if faulty, can for example lead to leakage of water into the interior of the vehicle, or to so-called '2wind-noise" as the vehicle moves at speed. hitherto in the mass production of motor vehicles, it has generally only been possible to test the seals of a percenta of vehicles produced owing to the costly and time consuming teclmiques employed. a typical method has been to test say 10 per cent of finished vehicles by subjecting them to a water spray around the exterior of the vehicle. the interior of the vehicle is then inspected by an operator whose assess- ment of the existence and location of leaks is neeesserily subjective. it is possible, where leaks exis+, that tbo interio of the tested,vehicle will become soiled, and moreover the system only enables a check to be made on production standards it does not practicably allow the standard of sealing ol each vehicle to be checked. the invention provides a method of testing vehicle seals, including the steps of establishing a temperature difference between the air on respective sides of a seal, and detecting leaks by monitoring the infra-red radiation from surfaces at and adjacent the seal. preferably the method includes the step of establishing a pressure difference across the seal. the invention extends to apparatus for performing the above method. the invention will now be described, by way of example; wi 611 reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: - fire 1 shows a motor vehicle in sidle and plan views ir conjunction with a diagrammatic representation of apparatus fc monitoril1g the infra-red radiation from surfaces on the motor vehicle; and figure 2 is a front view of another motor vehicle showir. typical camera positions which enable the top, sides and undcr side of the vehicle to be scanned. firgure 1 shows a motor vehicle 11, in the upper part of the figure in side view and in the lower part of the figure in plan view the vehicle ii is in the minimum state of build compatible with testing of its seals, that is to say it is ful glazed with doors, door seals, boot, boot seals and floor in place. this reduces the amount of dismantling and reassembly required to rectify any leaks discovered as compal-Â°d to that required in a finished vehicle, although the testing system could of course be used on finished vehicles. vehicle 11 is mounted on an assembly conveyor 12 at the point where it passed through a seal testing station, which is confined to approximately one vehicle - length thus saving space as compared to conventional testing stations. the static whilst open at its ends, is located in an enclosure of a mater: and finish such as affects minimum interference by ambient emissions with the resolution of the infra-red detecting system hereinafter described. prior to its arrival at the testing stations, the vehicle has its interior filled with air 100c

<CLAIMS>
   1, a    method of testing vehicle   sells,      char-cterised    by the    seps of establishing a temperature difference between    ne    air on respective sides of a seal, and detecting  leaks by monitoring the infra-red   radiation      from      surfaces     at and adjacent to the seal.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the  step of   feeding    into the interior of the vehicle, air  at a   temperature    different from the temperature of  ambient air surrounding the vehicle.   3. a method as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that  said infra-red radiation is monitored at least thirty  seconds after said air at a temperature different from  ambient has   bes:un    to enter said vehicle.   4. a method as   claimed    in claim 2 or 3, characterised in  that said air at a temrerature   different      fro      ambient     is fed into said vehicle through a ventilation aperture  in said   vehicle,    5. a method as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised  in that said temperature difference is at least ten  degrees   centrigrade.      6. a method as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised  by the step of establishing a pressure difference between  the air on respective sides of said seal,   whereby    air    flow leak in said seal is encouraged.       7. a method as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that air  is   pumped    into said vehicle to increase the pressure in  said vehicle.        8    a method as claimed in any   preodding    claim, characterised  in that said infra-red radiation is monitored by a camera  (14) which produces an image showing the temperatures of  parts of the vehicle.      9+    a method as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that  said camera (14) scans the surface of the vehicle and  produces an electrical signal representative of the  intensity of radiation detected.      10.    a method as claimed in claim 8 or 9, characterised in  that a plurality of cameras   (1s,15,16,17,20,21)    are  employed, each arranged to view a different part of the  vehicle.
