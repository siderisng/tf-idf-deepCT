<ABSTRACT>
a sieving device comprises a sieve (71) with an  electrical linear device mounted in spaced apart relation  from the mesh (91) of the sieve.  particles supplied to the  side of the mesh (91) away from the thrust device are  caused by the trust device to move across the mesh and  those which are smaller than the mesh pass through the  mesh (91) and towards the thrust device.  conveniently a  plate (41) is disposed between the mesh and the plate.   particles passing through the mesh then come into contact  with the plate and move along it under the influence of  the thrust device.
