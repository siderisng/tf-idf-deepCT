<ABSTRACT>
scanning equipment is disclosed having n scanning  heads positioned at predetermined matrix points of a matrix  array so as to scan along interlaced substantially parallel  scan lines on a medium during relative scanning movements  between the medium and the head array in a scan pass  direction parallel to the scan lines, such interlaced scanning  movement being produced by repeated relative movement  between the medium and the head array in a medium  advance direction and in an array indexing direction transverse  thereto.  the specification describes methods of determining  the positions to be occupied by the scanning heads.   one method is illustrated in figure 2.  the heads are  notionally arranged in a line n1 to n11 and are then  notionally re-arranged in sub-groups s1, s2, s3.  the heads  in sub-groups s1, s2, s3 are spaced apart a distance greater  than the minimum spacing physically required between two  adjacent heads.  the sub-groups are then formed into a linear  array by displacing s2 and s3 a distance p and 2p where p is  equal to nt, the number of nozzles, times d, the inter-scan  spacing.
