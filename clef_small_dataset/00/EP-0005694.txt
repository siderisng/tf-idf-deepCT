<ABSTRACT>
a fault current protection interrupter which is also sensitive to direct current operates less well in the presence of a strong a. c.  fault current.  according to the invention, the magnetic circulation resulting from an a. c.  component of the fault current is compensated for in a core 12, by means of a suitable circuit, which is shown in dotted lines in figure 7, in that a corresponding current is directed via a coil 1 of this core, as shown in figures 1 and 7.  this compensation current is a measure of the a. c.  component.  the core, in which there is no interfering, changing magnetic flux, is used to establish the d. c.  component.  the components of the d. c.  fault current and of the a. c.  fault current established in this way are transferred to a suitable evaluation circuit which initiates a disconnection if the values arising are not permissible.  <image>
