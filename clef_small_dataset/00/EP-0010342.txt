<ABSTRACT>
weight actuated feed drop apparatus (10) including a  bracket (14) adapted to be attached to a conveyor system (12)  and having an inlet opening therein for receiving material (33)  from the conveyor system, and an outlet opening for allowing  the material (33) to exit from the bracket (14) by gravity.  a  valving mechanism (24) is pivotally attached along an axis to  the bracket (14) for movement between a first position  wherein the valve mechanism closes the outlet opening of the  bracket (14) and a second position wherein the valve mechan足 ism (24) is open to allow material (33) to pass from the con足 veyor system (12) through the bracket (14) to a container (28)  disposed below the bracket (14).  a projection on the valve  mechanism is provided for automatically increasing the clos足 ing force on the valve mechanism (24) as it closes.  one end of  a flexible line is attached to the valve mechanism (24) and  extends over the projection.  the other end of the line is  attached to the container (28) for holding the container (28)  whereby a predetermined amount of material (33) by weight  is automatically dispensed into the container (28), upon which  event the valve mechanism (24) automatically closes to insure  that no more than the desired weight of material (33) is dis足 pensed.
