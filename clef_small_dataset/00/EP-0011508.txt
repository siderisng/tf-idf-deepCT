<ABSTRACT>
a ballast circuit for a gas discharge lamp (l) which com­ prises a series resistance (r1) and a series capacitor (c1), the  capacitor serving to store a charge provided by a starter cir­ cuit (d1, r1) to attain a starting voltage for the lamp, the  capacitor also being assigned to determine the mean operat­ ing current for the lamp and its capacitance being selected to  barely supply adequate operating current for predetermined  lamp illumination, and the resistor being assigned to limit  peak currents through said lamp and being of a resistance  barely adequate to avoid excessive peak current through  said lamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
control circuit for the gas discharge lamps the present invention relates to an improved control circuit for gas discharge lamps. in the prior art the most common type of gas discharge lamps and circuitry therefor are found in fluorescent lighting. almost invariably in this type of circuit an inductive ballast is used in conjunction with a starter switch or circuit. these components in combination being connected to a supply voltage to give a momentary surge voltage to ionise the fluorescent lamp, with the ballast then acting, after striking of the lamp as a choke to limit or stabilize the current. these prior art systems suffer from the following disadvantages: 1. a need for power factor correction 2. humming of ballast 3. the weight of fittings 4. the size of the base to house the control equipment 5. heat generated in the ballast 6. a comparatively high cost the present invention seeks to eliminate the conventional form of inductive ballast, the replaceable starter switch, the starter socket, and the capacitor used for power factor correction to overcome the lagging effect of the current due to the inductive ballast, and thereby largely avoid the above disadvantages. a former system that has been used is a series resistor operating in conjunction with a low-voltage striking tube. in this case the peak supply voltage is sufficient to strike the lamp. if the lamp is of 20w type operating at, say l00v running voltage on a 250v supply circuit, the resistor has to drop 150v after lamp striking. this will dissipate approximately 20w at the lamp and 30w in the resistor, so that the arrangement is consuming approximately 50w for the 20w of illuminating power. this excessive power consumption is, of course, undesirable. numerous attempts have been made to minimise the waste of power in the ballast and to avoid at least some of the disadvantages listed above. the use of a resistor ae the principal component for ballasting is far from ideal as these components are noted for their high watts loss. inductors have been preferred due to their reduced watts loss compared to the resistor, despite their relative bulk and increasing cost. hence, the ballast circuit for a gas discharge lamp as presently adopted almost invariably has the form of the circuits disclosed in u.s. patent specification nos. 2,575,001 (bird) and 3,857,063 (major et al). in the former specification the operating circuit for the lamp includes a series-connection from the applied power through an inductor and a capacitor having a capacitance of about l3pf and a reactance at the line frequency of about twice that of the inductor. the principal function of the capacitor is to increase the starting potential on the lamp. in the latter specification the operating circuit comprises only an inductor for stabilizing the lamp operating current. it has been generally accepted in the industry that a capacitor is not readily adaptable as the principal component for ballasting in the operating circuit of a gas d-ischarge lamp, regardless of the
