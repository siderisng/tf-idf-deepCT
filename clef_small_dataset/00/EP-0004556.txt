<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for producing an intermediate carrier for semiconductor chips, which has fan-shaped electrical conductors for connection to the input / output terminals of the semiconductor chip. In matrixed holes of two clamping elements (22, 24; Fig. 8) electrically insulated wires (11) are clamped. They pass through two perpendicular to their longitudinal axis and arranged in the middle between the clamping elements parallel levels. The first is formed by parallel to each other wires (30), the second also also arranged by parallel to each other wires (32), which extend perpendicular to those of the first plane. By turning cross members (34, 35) on which the wires are rotatably mounted, their distance is reduced in both levels. Thus, the mutual distance of the wire planes passing through the electrically insulated wires (11) is evenly reduced. The compressed matrix-like electrically insulated wires (11) are held in this position by jaws (38, 40) and surrounded with a mold (42). As their walls also serve the clamping element and the jaws. After the introduction and curing of an organic resin material, the casting is removed. The wires (11) are sheared off behind the clamping member and the jaws, whereupon the insulation is removed from the projecting wire ends of the intermediate carrier.
