<ABSTRACT>
When welding and drilling with laser beams, the heat dissipation in the workpiece in the radial direction in the edge region of the beam is much better than in the middle, so that even in a homogeneous narrower distribution over the whole beam cross section, the workpiece temperature in the center of the beam cross section may be much higher than in the edge area . Since practically all laser and corpus colors have a Gaussian intensity distribution, the ratios in practice are still much more unfavorable. Therefore, according to the invention, a laser beam (2) is directed to the base area of ​​a conjunction with transparent, refractive material, also known as axicon cone (5). When leaving the beam is bent so that a diverging intensity distribution is formed in the form of a hollow cone. By downstream lens (6), which is axially displaceable with respect to the axikon or a workpiece (7), can be generated on the latter ring or cup-shaped temperature distributions which cause a homogenization of the temperature in the workpiece.
