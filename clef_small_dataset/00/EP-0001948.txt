<ABSTRACT>
1.  a device for maintaining two adjacent window pane elements of the type comprising a support longitudinal member (1, 60, 64) on which bears, on each side of a centre rib (24, 62, 66), a window pane wall, an elastic joint cover spaced from said centre rib and bearing against the face of the two window pane elements opposed to the support of the longitudinal element, and means for retaining the joint cover supported by the longitudinal element, characterised in that the window pane elements have a plurality of walls, the device further comprises at least one section member (16, 26, 36) of a heat insulating material which, without being fixed to the longitudinal element, bears through two longitudinal projections (22, 30, 32, 50, 52) on the two base walls (12 and 14) of the two window pane elements and supports two directly upper second walls (13 and 15) of said window pane elements so that it supports the forces which are exerted on said two walls (13 and 15) and which defines a thick layer of air (25, 58, 35-84 to 87) surrounding at least the part of the centre rib of the longitudinal member which projects relative to the second walls (13 and 15) but is spaced from the joint cover, the section member having a centre rib which is not in contact with the joint cover.
