<ABSTRACT>
in an improved method for the wet transfer printing of  wool or wool-rich fabric the untreated fabric has introduced  into it, as part of the wet transfer printing process, chlorine or  a chlorine donor.  the chlorine or chlorine donor is introduced  before dye is transferred to the fabric, and when a chlorine  donor is used an impregnating liquor for wet-transfer printing  can be used to release chlorine from the donor.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "improvements in and relating to wet transfert printing" the present invention is concerned with wet transfer printing of materials, especially wool and wool rich fabrics. conventional wet transfer printing processes comprise printing the design on paper with suitable dyestuffs, impregnating the fabric to be printed with an aqueous solution which may for example contain a dye fixation catalyst and a thickener, and bringing the paper and the fabric into close contact by applying pressure and heat to transfer the dye from the paper to the fabric and to fix it in the same operation. it is well-known to print by a wet transfer process fabrics consisting wholly or mainly of wool. examples of such processes are described in uk patent specifications nos 1227271 and 1243223 and particularly in uk 1284824 which describes the sccalled fastran process. however, for the prints resulting frown such processes to have comm.ercial acceptability; the woollen or wool rich fabric has been required to have been pre-treated to render the fabric more receptive to the dyestuffs employed. one such treatment is the well-known technique of chlorination, others being the pre-treatment with proprietary chemicals such as fichlor and basolan. all such treatments have been traditionally slow, complicated and expensive. the cost and 2z1 convenience resulting from the employment of these processes has been a significant contributory factor in the relatively restrained production to date of printed woollen goods. if untreated wool is subjected to a conventional printing process, whether by transfer printing or other known printing processes, the resulting prints are of much reduced colour yield and are of a pronounced skittery appearance compared with those produced on wool pretreated by one of the aforementioned techniques. it has now been discovered that a considerable and unexpected improvement in dye yield and print quality can be obtained using untreated wool or ovol rich fabrics if chlorine, or a chlorine doner, is introduced into the fabric within the wet transfer printing process itself rather than by a separate pretreatment process. the success of this technique is particularly unexpected since expert opinion has for many years been that the pre-treatment required to obtain satisfactory print quality was subject to multifarious critical reaction conditions which of necessity resulted in a slow, complicated and expensive process. in the simplest embodiment of this invention, chlorine or a chlorine donor, is added to the impregnation solution which is used as part of the conventional wet transfer printing process to wet the fabric immediately prior to its being brought into contact with the transfer paper. by virtue of this step, prints of quality similar to those obtained using pre-treated fabric are obtained without the extra pre-treatment processing, thereby enabling meaningful economies in cost and convenience to be effected. in a preferred embodimen, the chlorine donor is introduced into the untreated woollen fabric separately from the impregnating liquor but immediately prior to the impregnation step, impregnation being effected by passing the fabric through a liquor coating device immediately prior to being brought into contact with

<CLAIMS>
what we claim is:   1. in a process for wet transfer printing a wool or  wool rich fabric which comprises impregnating said  fabric with an impregnating liquor and bringing a  transfer print paper and the fabric into close  contact, applying pressure and heat to transfer  the dye from the paper to the fabric and fix the  dye, the improvement which comprises introducing  into the fabric as part of the wet transfer  printing process, chlorine or a chlorine donor  before transferring the dye from the paper to the  fabric.   2. a process according to claim 1 in which the  chlorine donor comprises an aqueous solution  of a hypochlorite.    3. a process according to claim 1 or 2 in which the  chlorine or chlorine donor is added to the  impregnating liquor with which the fabric is  impregnated during the wet transfer printing  process, said liquor   releasing    chlorine from  said chlorine donor.   4. a process according to claim 1 or 2 in which the    chlorine    or chlorine donor is introduced into  the wool or wool rich fabric separately from  the impregnating liquor but immediately before  the impregnation with said solution.   5. a process according to claim 4 in which the  impregnation with said impregnating liquor is  effected by passing the fabric through a liquor  coating device immediately prior to being brought  into contact with the transfer paper, the liquor  serving to release chlorine from said chlorine  donor.
