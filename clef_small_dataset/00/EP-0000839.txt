<ABSTRACT>
composition for a friction material e. g.  for a brake pad, of  the type containing a fibrous reinforcement, a binder and  various additives.  the friction material contains no asbestos, but has properties  comparable with asbestos-based materials.  the composition  contains a thermoset binder including a phenol-formaldehyde  resin and making up 20 to 60% by volume of the  material.  besides the resin the binder can also include a heat  and chemical resistant rubber, but the phenol-formaldehyde  resin makes up at least 10% by volume of the composition.  the composition includes a fibre-based reinforcement  which makes up to 10 to 35% by volume of the material and  consists of a mixture of steel fibres or glass fibres with one or  more other non-asbestos inorganic reinforcing materials e. g.   steel fibre and mica, or steel fibre and milled glass.
