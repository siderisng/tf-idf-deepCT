<ABSTRACT>
a sealing assembly for sealing the expansion gap bet­ ween adjacent sectons of a structure has elongated elasto­ meric pads (2, 24) laid end to end along the length of the  gap with a groove (6) in at least one of the end surfaces  (4) of each pad for containing a flowable sealant (in fig.  7  the abutting end surfaces of the pad are shown spaced  apart for clarity).  in order to achieve a seal which satisfactorily prevents  access of debris and liquid into the expansion gap, while  being easily formed after the pads are mounted in place,  the groove has an inlet port at the top edge of the end sur­ face through which the flowable sealant may be injected  e. g.  from a container (48).  an intermediate sealing portion  (12) for housing the sealant (46) to prevent debris and  liquid from passing between the end faces, and a vent por­ tion (22) communicating between the intermediate seal­ ing portion (12) and the top edge of the end surface (4),  so that sealant emerging from the top of the vent portion  will indicate that the intermediate sealing portion has been  filled.  the other pad (24) may have a tongue which pro­ jects into, but does not fill, the groove (6), or may have a  groove corresponding and opposed to the groove (6).  the  sealing portion (12) includes a length at the bottom edge  of the endface (4), at which the sealant contacts the struc­ ture section.
