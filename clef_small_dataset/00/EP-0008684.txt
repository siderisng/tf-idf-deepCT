<ABSTRACT>
a method is specified by means of which it is possible to measure the power of fuel cells in nuclear reactors, which varies over its length.  the measured data thus obtained serve in a known way to regulate and monitor the reactor, which is preferably a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor.  the method provides for measurement, at a number of points (16) of a fuel rod that are arranged in pairs at a distance from one another, of the temperature difference, from which the values for the power can then be derived.  the measurement is performed by series-connected thermocouples, the junctions being placed at the desired measuring points.  the fuel rod provided with the thermocouples is alternately filled with tablets (1, 2) of different material composition or different fuel concentration, and thus also different thermal properties.  the number of pairs of measuring points is selected as a function of the thermal conductivity of the different materials.  the parts of the fuel rod filling in contact with the thermocouples are to consist of a mixture of fissile material and fertile material, in which the spent fissile material is replaced in each case by the material newly formed from the fertile material.  <image>
