<ABSTRACT>
in a bilumen catheter (101), one lumen (202) carries an  electrical conductor (204) terminating as a cathode of an elec­ trochemical gas sensor.  potting material (206) such as epoxy  seals off both lumens(201,202), encloses and holds the end of  the conductor (204), and exposes a tip (207) thereof of pre­ determined cross-section, which defines the cathode elec­ trode.  the tip (207) is dip-coated to form a selectively perme­ able membrane (208), and an opening (205) is provided into  the second lumen (201) for withdrawal of samples of blood or  the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
monopolar bilumen electrochemical sensor catheter field of the invention this invention relates to electrochemical sensors for blood gases, and particularly to combination sensors, such as for neonatal applications, whereby blood samples may be withdrawn through the gas sensing -catheter. background of the invention and prior-art in u.s#pn. 3,912,614 to spracklen-et al, issued october 14, 1975 and entitled "sensor", there is disclosed a monopolar catheter type electrochemical sensor, to be used in conjunction with an external, such as transcutaneous, anode electrode for in vivo sensing of blood gas concentration. in accordance with the sensors set forth in that #atent, an elongated conductor terminates in a tip defining tie electrode, a noble metal of predetermined area, enclosed in an epoxy resin but for the active surface. the assembly is encapsulated in a selectively permeable membrane which allows selected fluid constituents to migrate through the membrane for electrochemical reaction at the electrode. electrodes in accordance with the foregoing spracklen et al patent are primarily intended for insertion, in catheter fashion, into a vein or an artery, or into cellular tissue. the external electrode is affixed to the body, and the potential difference between the respective electrodes is monitored, thereby yielding representation of concentration of the material (e.g. oxygen concentration in blood) to which the membrane is selectively permeable. monopolar polarographic sensors of the type set forth in the aforementioned spracklen et al patent are advantageously applied to the monitoring of blood gas conditions in neonates. especially in the case- of premature babies for whom continuous and intensive care is required, it is important periodically to monitor many blood parameters simultaneously, and continuously to monitor a few specific parameters, such as oxygen partial pressure. one conventional procedure entails periodic umbilical insertion of a sampling catheter, whereby blood samples may be withdrawn and analyzed, followed by umbilical invention of blood gas sensor catheters such as those shown in the spracklen et al patent. it is an object of-the present invention to provide an improved polarographic sensor, which is suitable for neonatal applications (or other similar epplications calling for periodic fluid sample withdrawals) without the need for intermittent withdrawals and insertions of various types of catheter. prior art approaches to such dual function catheters include those in which a tubular catheter is extruded with an electrode wire/conductor embedded in the catheter walls. such designs, however, involve manufacturing difficulty, and ultimate uncertainty as to the isolation of the entire electrode/conductor from the fluid withdrawal channel. summary of the present invention the present invention involves a catheter type polarographic electrode assembly wherein an elongated flexible member, adapted for insertion into a patient, carrjies-two distinct longitudinal channels, or lumens, therein. one channel carries an electrical conductor, and the other is open for blood withdrawal or for drug or nutrient infusion. the assembly terminates in the actual polarographic sensor, wherein an epoxy resin seals the end of both lumens, holds the electrode wire, and exposes a predetermined cross-section thereof. the tip is coated with a membrane such as poly hydroxyethylmethacrylate,
