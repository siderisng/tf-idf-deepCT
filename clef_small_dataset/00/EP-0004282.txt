<ABSTRACT>
1.  a hospital bed comprising a back rest (1), a seat section (2) and a shank (3), having two pivots (6, 7) arranged in a common horizontal plane for supporting the back and shank rests and two pivots (4, 5) arranged at the joints between the back rest and seat and between the seat section and shank and in the area between the pivots (6, 7), further having two telescopic posts (8, 9) swivel-mounted on one end to the seat section and on the other end to the back rest and/or shank rest and adapted to be actuated by means of a handle (20), characterized in that the actuating means for locking the telescopic posts (8, 9) can be coupled to make the back and shank rests (1, 3) execute simultaneous rotary motions about the pivots (6, 7) in opposite directions, that both the back rest (1) and shank rest (3) can be coupled via a telescopic linkage (47, 60) with the aid of means (50, 65), and that both the connection between the actuating means for locking the telescopic posts (8, 9) and the telescopic linkage (47, 60) can be uncoupled for allowing individual adjustment of the back rest (1) and shank rest (3).
