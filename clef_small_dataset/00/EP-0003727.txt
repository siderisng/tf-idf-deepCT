<ABSTRACT>
1.  working appliance (1) movable on rails, with a frame (3) carrying the wheel sets (2), with a motor drive acting on at least one of the wheel sets (2), with a structure supported by the frame (3) and accommodating driver stands on the two end faces of the frame (3), and with a jib (5) which is supported by the frame (3), with a swivelling bolster (4) interposed, and can be raised and lowered about a horizontal axis and which supports, pivotably about an axis aligned transversely to the longitudinal axis of the jib (5), a tilting arm, at the other end of which a working stand (6) is arranged pivotably about an axis aligned transversely to the longitudinal axis of said tilting arm, characterized in that a frame mounting (10) is arrranged on the roof of the working appliance (1), and laterally of the centre longitudinal axis of the lowered jib (5), there are two stage platforms (16, 20) which are pivotable between a lower position of rest or working position and a higher working position, in which they form together a working surface, by means of guide rods (14 and 17, 12 respectively) actuated by hydraulic or pneumatic piston/cylinder arrangements (21, 22).
