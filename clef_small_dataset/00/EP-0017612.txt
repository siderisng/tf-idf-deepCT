<ABSTRACT>
In a device for metered supplying toner to the crust leak (18) of an electrolytic cell with in a standing channel (35), connected to a drive (32) and a tonerdesilo (26) connected conveyor member, the channel (35) is below a filling opening (31) designed guide tube (29) formed for a piston system (35), which has at least one forming as a limited dosing space (40). This dosing space (40) is determined by a closure piston (36) and a metering piston (37), wherein its width (a) adjustment is bar and optionally the width (b) of the filling opening (31) of a displacement point attached to the filling opening (42 ) corresponds. If several dossier rooms are desired, they are formed by a plurality of closure pistons (36) and dosing pistons (37). The piston system (35) is connected via a linkage (38) with a preferably pneumatic drive (32) and reciprocable. If the discharge opening (42) is below the filling opening (31), the piston system (35) is rotatable about its axis (M) by means of the drive (32). Between both openings under break one or more recesses (49, 52) the piston system (35). The discharge opening (42) opens into a funnel (44), which supplies the toner to the crust pressure fracture.
