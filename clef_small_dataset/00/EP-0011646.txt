<ABSTRACT>
an electronically tuned radio receiver adapted for digital  selection is provided with circuit means (b₉) for detecting that  the received frequency is outside a band, and circuits (60, 62,  48, 50) for bringing the received frequency back within the  band in response to an output from the circuit means (b₉).  in  changing over bands, these circuits make it possible to avoid  the inconvenience of changing the received frequency to a  value below the lower frequency limit of a band.  moreover,  pulse generator circuits (144, 142) are connect-ed to the strobe  terminal g of a multiplexer (46) which changes over selection  systems.  this circuit is intended to rationalize selection speed.
