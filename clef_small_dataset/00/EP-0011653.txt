<ABSTRACT>
improvement in a radial-ply tire for enhancing separation  resistance property of the bead portion structure thereof.  a  part or the whole of carcass ply having incorporated therein  polyester cords is folded from inside to outside, upon which is  disposted a radial-ply tire having a steel chafer, upon which is  further disposed an organic fiber reinforcing layer.  the steel  chafer has a cord angle of from 15° to 45° and a height h which  is from 15 to 28% of the height to tire inner face.  the carcass  has a maximum folding edge height h which is not greater  than 85% of the steel chafer height h.  the organic fiber rein­ forcing layer has a cord angle of from 20 to 75° relative to the  peripheral direction of the tire.  a crossing angle between the  cord and the steel chafer is not less than 10°.
