<ABSTRACT>
the invention refers to a castor wheel with a rotatably  supporte forked journal (3, 4).  the castor wheel can be at­ tached to a base thereby that an attachment member (8),  which is rotatable relative to the forked journal, is provided  with a threaded portion (11) intended to cooperate with a cor­ respondingly threaded portion of the base, and thereby that  the outer contour of the attachment member has a shape suit­ ed for exerting it to a torque.  the contour is preferably in the  form of a nut.

<DESCRIPTION>
a castor wheel the present invention refers to a castor wheel of the type defined in the preamble of claim 1. such castor wheels are used in many different applications, e.g. on customer trolleys in stores and on other small transport carts or trolleys in industry, business and communication. the castor wheels are often exerted to large stresses and they therefore must have high strength and wear resistance. as they are often used in an aggressive environment it is necessary that the bearings forming part of the castor wheels are well sealed off. it is furthermore desirable that the castors aro easily exchangeable, i.e. that they are easy to mount on and dismount from the vehicles whereon they are provided. hitherto known castor wheels are generally attached to the base by means of an attachment plate and one or more attachment screws and/or nuts. the screws or the nuts are intended to be turned by means of a suitable tool and as they are genarally difficult to access, mounting and dismounting are often complicated. the primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a castor wheel which is stable and wear resistant, which can be mounted on and dismounted from the device provided therewith with simple aids and at which the bearings forming part of the castor wheel are well protected and sealed off. the invention will hereinafter be further described with rorerence to the accompanying drawing, which partly in section shows one embodiment of a castor wheel according to the invention. a wheel 1 is supported on a shaft 2 in a forked journal having two arms 3, 4. at the inner end of the forked journal on the bearing seat of the journal there is mounted a rolling bearing having an outer race ring 5, an inner race ring 6 and rolling bodies 7 arranged therebetween. the forked journal is, by means of this bearing pivotably supported on a member 8, on which the bearing is mounted and which member is intended to be fixed against the device provided with the castor wheel the bearing is preferably a deep groove ball bearing, which can take up radial as well as axial forces. the number 8 has a central through bore 9. a screw 10 extends through the bore and also through the inner race ring of ihe bearirlg. rhe free end of the screw is provided with a thread 11. the screw and the member 8 are nonrotatably inter-connected preferably thereby that the bore 9 and the portion of the screw situated therein has noncircular cross-sections. at the mounting of the castor wheel the member 8 is screwed onto the device provided with the castor wheel with this screw, which either can be screwed into a threaded bore in the device or can be inserted through a bore in this and be provided with a nut on the rear side thereof. the member 8 has an outer contour, which is adapted for subjecting it to a torque.

<CLAIMS>
claims   1. a castor wheel incorporating a forked journal or the like which is rotatably supported in a bearing on a member (8) intended to be attached to the device provided with a castor wheel, characterized thereby, that said member has an outer contour, which is adapted for applying a torque onto the member, and which is provided with a threaded part (11) non-rotatably connected to the member and intended to be screwed onto said device at the mounting of the castor wheel.   2. a castor wheel according to claim 1, characterized thereby, that the forked journal or the like is supported on said member in a bearing (5, 6, 7) adapted to take up axial and radial forces and arranged in a bearing seat on the forked journal or the like, and that the outer part of said   member    is designed as an annular axial flange (13), which encloses the bearing and the seat.   3. a castor wheel according to claim 1 or 2, characterized thereby, that the outer contour of said member has the form of a nut.   4. a castor wheel according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterized thereby, that the forked journal or the like is supported on said member in a bearing incorporating an inner (6) and an outer (5) race ring, that the inner race ring of the bearing encloses a portion of said member, which member is provided with a through bore (9), that the screw (10), the threaded part (11) of which forms said threaded part of the member is arranged through this bore and that the screw is prevented from rotation in the bore.      5. a castor wheel according to claim 4, characterized thereby, that the bore and the portion of the screw arranged therein are tapering in a direction against the threaded part of the screw.   6. a castor wheel according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterized thereby, that the bearing is a deep groove ball bearing.   7. a castor wheel according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterized thereby, that the bearing is arranged adjacent a through hole (16) in the forked journal, which hole is. mainly concentric with the bearing, and opens between the fork arms where it is covered by a separate cover (17).
