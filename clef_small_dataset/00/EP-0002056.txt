<ABSTRACT>
a combination of a vehicle and a demountable body  (b) for transporting loads, the vehicle having a support  (14) which is movable between a horizontal position to  support the body (b) for transportation and an inclined  position.  the support (14) carries an ended chain (19)  provided at one end with a hook (21) for attachment to  the body (b), and an endless chain (20) provided with a  pusher to engage the body (b), the chains (19, 20) being  driven by a drive means (26).  the body (b) has a guide  arranged on lowering of the hook (21) towards a lifting bar  (18) on the body (b), to guide the hook (21) into engagement  with the bar (18) whereupon the hook (21) is automatically  releasably attached to the bar (18).  with the support  (14) in its horizontal position, the drive means (26)  is operable in the reverse direction to cause the endless  chain (20) to push the body (b) off the support (14) on  to a supporting surface at the same height as the support  (14).
