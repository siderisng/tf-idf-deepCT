<ABSTRACT>
For the production of very narrow doping areas in a semiconductor body with utilizing a diffusion of the respective dopants from associated source layers, a method is given, with which these source layer regions can be interpreted smaller than with conventional lithographer and etching methods possible. For this purpose, a substantially horizontal and vertical surface areas having a substantially horizontal and vertical surface areas are formed by applying and molding of insulating layer areas (50) on a semiconductor body. On the surface thus obtained, a source layer (52) doped in the desired doping type is then applied. Taking advantage of the different etch rate in the vertical and horizontal direction, the source layer is removed from the hori zontal surface areas with TELS reactive ion etching. It then remains only very narrow swelling layer areas (52) on the vertically directed surfaces. The formation of the ultimately very narrow doping areas (56, 58) is finally done by a known heat treatment from the very narrow swelling layer (52). Their width can be varied with the selected layer thickness of the source layer (52). Applications of the procedure for the construction of, FET and bipolar semiconductor assemblies are treated.
