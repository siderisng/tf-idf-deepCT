<ABSTRACT>
1.  fuel tank flap device covering a shallow recess (17) on the bodywork of a motor vehicle, with a hinge joint (11 ; 63 ; 85) for pivotally mounting a tank flap (10 ; 65 ; 82), which in its closed position covers a filler hole (e. g. 83) in the recess (17) and the recess (17) itself, and with a crank-lever arrangement (e. g. 27, 51) which secures the tank flap (10 ; 65 ; 82) in its open and closed positions, and in an intermediate position assumes an elongated state, wherein one of the levers of the crank-levers arrangement (e. g. 27, 51) is constructed as a rigid lever (e. g.  51) rigidly connected to the tank flap (10 ; 65 ; 82) and the other levers is constructed as a bending rod (27 ; 60 ; 84) which is spring-extensible at right angles to its longitudinal extension, the two ends of which (25, 26 ; 77, 78 ; 94 ; 95) are pivotally connected either to the tank flap (65 ; 82) or the rigid lever (74 ; 87), or to a part (15, 16) fixed to the vehicle, and its middle portion (28 ; 61 ; 108) is pivotally connected either to a part (62, 104) fixed to the vehicle, or to the rigid lever (36) or the tank flap (10), the two ends (22, 23 ; 61, 66 ; 93 ; 108) of the crank-lever arrangement (e. g.  27, 51) being pivotally connected to the vehicle and, with the tank-flap (10 ; 65 ; 82) closed, lying in the shallow bodywork recess (17) beneath the side of the tank flap (10 ; 65 ; 82) facing away from the vehicle exterior.
