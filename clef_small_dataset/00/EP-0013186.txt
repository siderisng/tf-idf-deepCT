<ABSTRACT>
self-texturing sub-filaments split from a conjugate fila­ ment.  the conjugate filament is melt spun from dissimilar  polymers, the spinning and quenching conditions being  selected such that the conjugate filament has no substantial  crimp while the sub-filaments split therefrom have substan­ tial latent torqueless helical crimp.  preferably the conjugate  filament is hollow.  a preferred spinneret blank 22 has horse-­ shoe shaped slots 20 with recessed web  regions 24.  two  dissimilar polymers are fed as a sheath-core conjugate stream  with polymer interface 20.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for aielt-spi'inltig a splittable conjugate filament; self-texturing splittable conjugate filament; and method of splitting such a filament the invention relates to the art of conjugate filaments splittable into sub-filaments. more particularly, it relates to a process and product wherein the conjugate filament itself has no substantial texture while sub-filaments splittable therefrom have substantial latent torqueless helical crimp. conjugate filaments splittable into sub-filaments are known to the art as typified by hayashi u.s. 'pa- tent 4,051,287. as disclosed therein, alternating segments of polyamide and polyester are spun in a side-by-side adhering relationship to form a hollow filament splittable into subfilaments. such sub-filaments can be of smaller denier than can be conventiently spun as separate filaments, lending a soft hand to fabrics made therefrom. the sub-filaments of hayashi are not disclosed as possessing significant crimp, and, as illustrated in figure 10 of the patent, are substan- tially flat (untextured) even though the conjugate filament had been textured by the ralse-twist heat-set method before being split into sub-filaments. according to the invention, there is provided a conjugate filament splittable into sub-filaments having substantial latent torqueless helical crimp. according to a major aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for melt-spinning a hollow conjugate filament splittable into spontaneously texturing subfilaments, the process comprising extruding a hollow ,olden stream formed froa axially extending segments of dissimilar polymers arranged alternately in side-by-side adhering relationship to form the hollow molten stream; c > enchine the stream under given conditions to form a filament; and zçithdrawing the filament from the molten stream at a given spinning speed, the polymers, the given spinning speed and the given conditions being selected such that subfilaments split from the filament possess substantial latent torqueless helical crimp. according to another aspect of the invention, some of the segments are of polyamide polymer and others of the segments are of polyester polymer. according to another aspect of the invention, the polyamide polymer is nylon 66 and the polyester polymer is polyethylene terephthalate. according to another major aspect of the invention, there is provided a conjugate filament comprising subfilaments releasably attached to one another in a side-byside relationship, the filament being substantially free of crimp, the sub-filaments possessing substantial latent torqueless helical crimp. according to another aspect of the invention, the filament is hollow. according-to-another aspect of the invent-ion, some of the sub-filaments are formed from a polyamide polymer and others of the sub-filaments are formed from a polyester polymer. according-to another aspect of the invention, the polyamide polymer is nylon 66 and the polyester polymer is polyethylene terephthalate. other aspects of the invention will in part appear hereinafter and will in part be obvious from the following detailed description taken together with the accompanying drawing, in which: the figure is a bottom plan view (looking up) of the preferred spinneret orifice used in practicing the invention. as shown in the figure, the preferred spinneret construction includes several generally arched or horseshoeshaped slots 20 in spinneret blank 22 arranged symmetrically about a
