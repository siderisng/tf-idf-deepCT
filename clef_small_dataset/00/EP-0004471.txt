<ABSTRACT>
wrapping apparatus to progressively wrap a paper sheet (16) helically about a longitudinally axially elongated generally cylindrical object such as a roll of carpet (11) comprises a frame (42, 43, 44) including a beam member (44) extending in the general direction of the axis (12) of the carpet roll, and at a higher elevation than said axis, a head (26) carried by the beam for displacement therealong, and support structure (18) carried by the head to support a sheet roll (16b) of the wrapping material to rotate about another axis angled from horizontal and to directionally feed the sheet toward and into parallel and close tangency to the carpet roll (11), in a skew feed direction (17) relative to its axis (12), whereby as the carpet roll is rotated about its axis (12) by its driven support rollers (13), said head (26) is displaced along the beam (44) and the sheet unwinds from the sheet roll and becomes progressively wrapped about the carpet roll.  the beam is tiltable to return the head (26) to its starting position.
