<ABSTRACT>
a short wheelbase railroad truck (1) having two axles  (9,10 or 209,210) intended to assume a radial configuration  when the railroad vehicle rounds curves comprises a frame  having two side members (2,3 or 202,203)and axles mounted  in bearing means (11,14 or 211,214).  the bearing means are  pivotally attached to the frame members with at least two of  the bearing means being attached to the frame members by  means of steering levers (15 or 215) which are pivotally  attached to the associated bearing means and the frame  members for independent pivotal movement.  steering rods  (18 or 218) connect each steering lever to the vehicle body  such that the chording of the vehicle as it rounds a curve will  each axle to the radial alignment.  in one embodiment  each axle is guided by such steering rods and  levers.  in another embodiment one axle is  guided by steering rods and levers and the side members  move relatively longitudinally to guide the other axle.
