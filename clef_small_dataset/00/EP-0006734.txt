<ABSTRACT>
a fluid jet-mixing apparatus for use in a flow deflecting  structure or passageway unit disposed intermediately between  an inlet and an outlet of a fluid or fluids to and from an adjacent  reacting area in the upstream or downstream thereof, which  incorporates a guide vane assembly for allowing the fluid or  fluids to pass therethrough under appropriate flow velocity and  pressure conditions, the guide vane assembly comprising a  cylindrical wall member (5) defining the fluid passageway and a  flow deflecting structure of a guide vane form disposed within  the cylindrical wall member and composed of a plurality of  generally semi-elliptic shaped panel members (10) and a trianÂ­ gular-shaped partition member (9), and a suction or introduction  pipe member (15) incorporated concentrically in the centre of  the guide vane assembly and extending in communication with  the outside of the passageway system so as to cause another  fluid to be dynamically introduced or sucked from outside into  the fluid passageway system, thereby to have the flowing fluid or  fluids inside the passageway system mixed efficiently with the  fluid introducted from the outside of the passageway system.
