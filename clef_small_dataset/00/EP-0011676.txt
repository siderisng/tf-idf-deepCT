<ABSTRACT>
graphite particles as small as 38 microns are cleaned,  dried and chemically plated with copper or silver.  one or  multiple chemical platings may be carried out to provide a  uniform and thick metal coating.  the plated powders are dried  and then molded into a desired shape under heavy pressure in  a hydraulic press or the like after which the molded shape is  sintered under a hydrogen atmosphere for the subsequent  fabrication into monolithic or multi-elemental brushes for  high-current collectors.
