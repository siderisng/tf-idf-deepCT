<ABSTRACT>
process and plant for manufacturing carbonaceous solids  and hydrocarbons from discarded tires; pyrolysis reactor  for use in such process.  used tires are physically fragmented.   the fragments are pyrolized in an oxygen-limited, hydrocarbon  vapor at subatmospheric pressure in a reactor 32′.   entrained char can be separated from the vapor phase products  of the pyrolysis which are then fractionated into oil and  fuel gas.  reactor vapors are condensed to produce a heavy fuel oil  and a light fuel oil.  the fuel gas can be compressed and burnt  to provide process heat.  the entrained char and some heavy  oil can be returned to the reactor 32′.  solid phase pyrolysis  products can be stripped of trash and milled to carbon black.   the carbon black is formed into pellets with added water and  dried in a series multi-stage fluid bed dryer 126′.
