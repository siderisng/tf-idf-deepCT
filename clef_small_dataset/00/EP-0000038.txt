<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to method and apparatus  for substantially cancelling interference between signals  using the same frequency spectrum which are received via  overlapping area coverage (12) and spot coverage (e. g.  14a)  antenna beams.  at the transmitter where the overlapping  area and spot coverage beams are concurrently transmitted,  a predetermined portion of the area coverage signal is coupled  into each of the spot beam signals which will be overlapped  at the associated spot beam receiver area by the area  coverage beam.  the predetermined portion coupled into each spot beam  signal will have a magnitude and phase to substantially cancel  the area coverage signal at the associated spot beam  receiver area.
