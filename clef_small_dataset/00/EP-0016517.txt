<ABSTRACT>
a method of recovering oil from an oil containing fluid  mixture and apparatus for carrying out that method provides  that acceptable fluid is disposed of in a water body through  the use of an open ended skim pile (10), disposed in the water  body (12) and an interconnected settling tank (20).  fluid is  maintained in the settling tank (20) at a level independent of  the mean level of the water body, and a separating weir (40)  located within the settling tank (20) isolates oil which rises to  the top of the tank as a layer from which oil is recovered.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of r#covering oil and apparatus for recovering oil bly that method. the invention relates to a method of recovering oil from an oil containing mixture at an oil handling facility and apparatus for recovering oil by that method. tn particular, this invention relates to oil recovery at an oil handling facility located adjacent a body of water, and to the disposal of the relatively oil-free fluid into the body of water. in united states patent 3,893,918, issued july 8, 1975, there are disclosed skim piles or elongate separator conduits that are useful and efficient in such recovery and disposal operations. the length of the conduit and the operating procedures are such that the rising velocity of the oil in the mixture results in the establishment of an upper oil layer in the conduit. one of the skim piles disclosed in that patent operates while in continuous communication with the body of water. as such, the total fluid level in the skim pile is responsive to changes in mean level of the water body. provision is made for withdrawing oil from the oil layer on top of the total fluid column in response to sensing of the level of the interface between such oil layer and the remaining fluid column therebelow. in that fashion, one seeks to insure that only an oil rich mixture is withdrawn from the skim pile, rather than an oil-water mixture. although that technique has proved quite acceptable, some difficulties have been encountered especially in situations where unpredictably large or erratic total fluid level changes are produced in response to changes in mean level of the body of water. united states patent 3,893,918 alsc discloses a form of skim pile where the level of total fluid in the skim pile is basically isolated from changes in the mewn level of the water body through use up a valve. problems associated with changes in that mean water level are thereby avoided. such skim piles are normally employed only in shallow water situations where the underwater extent of the skim pile, if it were open at the bottom, would not normally be great enough to allow for good separation of oil. this is because tbe terminal rising velocity of the oil would not sufficiently overcome the exit velocity of downward flow in the conduit. although normally closed, valved, skim piles could be deployed in deeper water situations, operational and maintenance difficulties could become prominent by reason of the need to control a valve positioned at great depth. another form of skim pile has accomplished isolation of the total fluid therein from changes in mean water level without problems associated with underwater valve operation. in that form of skim pile, a generally u-shaped conduit is connected at one end near the bottom of the skim pile, and the upper covered portion of the conduit extends well above the water line. the u-shaped conduit thus functions as a weir which essentially maintains a fixed, above-water level of total fluid
