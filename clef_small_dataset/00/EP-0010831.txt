<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector for electrically interconnect足 ing a pair of spaced apart, substantially parallel, electrically  conductive pins comprises a housing (9) having opposed,  spaced apart cover members (11, 13) and a central hub  (15) between the cover members.  the connector further  includes a resilient, electrically conductive contact member  (16) which is disposed around the hub (15) in a loose fit  relationship.  the contact member defines a pair of opposed  contact portions (21) comprising surfaces disposed gener足 ally parallel to the mounting direction of the connector.   during mounting and dismounting of the connector from  a pair of pins, spaced by a distance less than the distance  between the contact portions of the contact member, the  force applied to the contact member (16) through the hub  (15) effects an elongation of the contact member longitu足 dinally of the pins, between which the contact member  becomes laterally compressed to effect the required electri足 cal interconnection.
