<ABSTRACT>
a composite electronic circuit accurately controls air-fuel ratio in an engine having an electronically regulated fuel supply, such as an electronically regulated fuel injection system.  the air-fuel ratio is measured by an oxygen sensor connected to the exhaust manifold.  a circuit associated with the oxygen sensor compensates for variations in sensor output produced by temperature change during warm-up.  after engine warm-up is completed, the circuit provides a voltage having a value independent of engine temperature.
