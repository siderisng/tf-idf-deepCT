<ABSTRACT>
the holding frame (13) is for aiding the secur­ ing of articles stacked on a pallet.  frame (13) is four-sided and slightly resilient, its four  sides (15, 15a) being so joined end to end that each is tilted  slightly with respect to the plane of the frame; each has one  flange (17) inclined upwardly from centre of the plane and  one flange (18) at an angle to the vertical when the frame (13)  is horizontal.  two sides (15a) are bowed slightly, and the  frame (13) is placed on a stack of articles (10) with the  flanges (18) encompassing the top edge of the stack, and  with the bowed sides (15a) concave upwardly.  appropriat­ ely placed holding straps (25) when tensioned around stack  and frame (13) result in elastic distortion of the frame which  reduces the tilting of all the sides (15, 15a) and the bowing  of bowed sides (15a).
