<ABSTRACT>
a collapsible clothesline (10) intended to be stored in  situ in the ground and to be erected by water pressure.  the  clothesline comprises a casing (11) intended to be located in  a bore in the ground and a stem (14) which is retractible into  and extensible from the casing.  the stem itself consists of an  inner and an outer stem element (15, 16) with the former  being retractible downwardly into and extensible upwardly  from the latter.  a number of arms (22) linked by lines for  supporting laundry, are pivoted to the outer stem element  (15) and are connected by ties (28) to the upper end of the  inner stem element (16).  when the inner stem element (16) is  extended from the outer stem element (15), with the outer  stem element (15) already extended from the casing (11), the  ties (28) pull the arms (22) up from a storage position, in  which they lie alongside the stem (14), to a use position, in  which they extend radially from the stem (14).  the clothesline  is erected by supplying water pressure to the casing  interior and collapsed by relieving such pressure.
