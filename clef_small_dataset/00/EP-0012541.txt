<ABSTRACT>
a method is disclosed of preparing a bituminous compo­ sition from an anionic bituminous (bitumen or bitumen plus a  rubber) emulsion, which composition is suitable for coatings  for sealing, water-proofing and insulating purposes.  the  composition has a controlled and known pot-life, acceptable  drying time and good resistance to re-emulsification.  the me­ thod is characterised by intimately mixing the emulsion with  an amount of an emulsion-breaking accelerator, the compo­ sition and quantity of which are such as initially to delay re­ lease of cations and thereafter release cations in a controlled,  uniform, rate for reaction with the anionic emulsifier(s) of the  emulsion.  further essential properties of the accelerator em­ ployed are that it neither materially alters the ph value of the  emulsion nor binds any substantial quantity of water.  calcium  sulphate dihydrate in a water-insoluble hydrocarbon fraction,  and employed at 1 to 2% treat rate, is a preferred accelerator.   an assembly of units containing various constituents re­ quired to produce the bituminous coating composition is also  described.

<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of bituminous coating composition this invention relates to bituminous coating and sealing compositions and to their preparation and use. the compositions are based on bituminous emulsions, more especially those suitable for water-proofing, sealing, insulation, and similar purposes in, for example, building and construction industries and in mining. as employed herein the term bituminous emulsion includes an emulsion of any one or more of: naturally occuring asphalt, petroleum derived asphalt, and bitumen derived from coal, for example pitches and tars. the term is also used to include the simple type of emulsions of bitumen and water and the type additionally containing a natural or synthetic rubber. this latter type is of especial interest in the building and the like industries. the emulsions are anionic emulsions, almost invariably of the oil-in-water type. one method of using such an emulsion is for it to be applied to the surface to be treated and the coating thus formed is left to dry by evaporation of the water component of the emulsion. this method of application suffers from a number of difficulties and disadvantages. two major ones are (a) the time taken for the coating to dry; during the drying period the coating is very vulnerable to damage, particularly by water, for example rainfall; and (b) after formation of a continuous film the emulsifiers present in the emulsion tend to be concentrated in the outer surface. persistent contact with water, for example during rainfall, tends to lead to a degree 'of re-emulsification with consequent loss of sealing quality or the water repellent quality of the coating. one type of solution to the problem which has been attempted is to spray a bitumen emulsion, or a bitumen-latex emulsion, onto a surface whilst at the same time separately spraying an emulsionbreaking/latex-breaking chemical onto the surface in such a way that the two sprays impinge at the moment the emulsion contacts the surface (as disclosed in british patent 941,656). in another proposal of this type, the spray of the chemical intersects the other spray before the surface is reached so that the emulsion and latex are broken before contact with the surface (as disclosed in british patent 1,383,463). in yet another proposal the emulsion is first coated on the surface and immediately after, while it is still wet, a coating of an aqueous solution of a salt such as calcium chloride is sprayed onto the surface as a protective layer (as disclosed in british patents nos 353,702 and 1,443,173). the above type of proposal essentially requires the use of very accurate spraying. however, when a wind is blowing then, often, atomized material cannot be directed accurately and consistently. material is wasted and environmental pollution cannot be avoided. a second type of attempted solution to the problem is concerned with reducing drying time by adding to the emulsion, before use, an accelerator of such composition and quantity that it binds all the water of the emulsion after the latter has broken (as disclosed in east german patent 66,128).

what   e      clad'i    is:   1. a method of preparing a bituminous composition suitable for coating onto a substrate as a sealant, or insulating or waterproofing agent, comprising the steps of intimately mixing together an aqueous anionic emulsion of bitumen or of bitumen and a rubber, and an amount of an emulsion-breaking accelerator; characterised in that the composition of, and the quantity of the accelerator employed are such as to cause the accelerator initially to delay release of cations for a period of time and then release cations at a substantially controlled and uniform rate for reaction with anionic emulsifier(s) of the emulsion without materially altering the ph value of the emulsion and without binding any substantial quantity of the water of the emulsion.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the accelerator includes at least one compound of a metal of group 2 or group 3 of the periodic table of elements.   3. a method as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the accelerator comprises a solution, dispersion, suspension or slurry in a substantially water-insoluble hydrocarbon fraction, preferably a mineral oil or a steam-cracker tar, of a said metal compound which has a water-solubility at 200c in the range 0.02 to 0.60, when expressed as   ca    gram per ml water.   4. a method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the compound is calcium compound, preferably calcium sulphate dihydrate.   5. a method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the accelerator comprises a mixture, slurry, dispersion or suspension, preferably in water or a substantially water-insoluble hydrocarbon fraction, of the metal compound and a masking agent for regulating delivery of cations for reaction with the said emulsifier(s).   6. a method as claimed in claim 5, wherein a calcium compound is employed, preferably an hydraulic cement is employed.   7. a method as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6, characterised in that the masking agent is sodium aluminate.      8. a method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the accelerator is employed in amount up to 5 wt.% (calculated as active constituent) by wt. of the emulsion, preferably from 0.4 to 2 wt.%.   9. an assembly of constituents required for the preparation of a bituminous composition by the method defined in any preceding claim; the assembly being characterised by having the constituents contained in individual but associated units, one unit comprising a quantity of the said aqueous anionic emulsion of bitumen or of bitumen and rubber, and at least one other unit containing the corresponding quantity of the said emulsionbreaking accelerator as individual solids, or as a mixture of solids, or as a solution, slurry, dispersion of suspension of said solids in water or the said hydrocarbon fraction.
