<ABSTRACT>
the electrode is used in particular for implantation in a chamber of the heart for stimulating the cardiac muscle and has an insulated electrode line (2) and at least one securing element (5) for fixing the electrode end, in order to bring a conductive area of the latter, forming the stimulation surface, into contact with the body tissue, the securing element in the area of the electrode end (3,11) forming the electrode head being set back in relation to its front face in the axial direction of the electrode line, being accommodated, for the insertion phase, essentially within the outer contour of the electrode head to which the body tissue is tangent, and, for fixing the electrode end, being arranged movably relative to the outer contour in such a way that, for engaging in the tissue surface, it projects beyond the outer contour behind the front face of the electrode head in relation to the direction of insertion of the electrode.  <image>
