<ABSTRACT>
a mechanical, seismic-shock-absorbing snubber  adapted to accept extremely high impact loads that may be  imposed upon it by reason of its interposition (at 6 and 10)  between heavy, relatively movable structures.  the snubber  employs, as its damping mechanism, escapement means,  preferably in the form of a pair of escapement wheels (30,32),  which rotates in response to relative movement of the struc­ tures between which the snubber is interposed and employs a  cooperating, pivoted, engagement means, preferably in the  form of a pair of pallet members (40, 42) of predetermined  effective mass each driven by a respective one of the escape­ ment wheels into oscillation.  it is the oscillation of the (or  each) pallet member, the rate of which is limited by the pallet  member's mass and natural period of oscillation, that restricts  or damps the velocity and acceleration of relative motion  between the structures with which the snubber is associated.   instead of employing an escapement wheel, a rack may be  employed, with the teeth of the rack engaging hooks or pallets  on the pallet member to drive the latter into oscillation as the  rack is moved relative to the pallet member.
