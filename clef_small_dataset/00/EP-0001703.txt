<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a device for supporting and training  plants and in particular for layering tomato plants.  it comprises  a longitudinal stem portion (1) formed with an integral  hook (5) which is adapted to grip and slide along a support  wire (6) which is mounted above and parallel to the plant row,  and a spool (8) rotatable about a cylindrical bearing surface of  the stem portion (3).  the spool (8) carries a support cord (9)  which passes upwardly from the spool, through an aperture in  the top of the stem portion (1) and down through the hollow  interior of the stem portion (1) to where it is tied to the stem of  the tomato plant.  when it is desired to layer the plant the stem  portion (1) is moved along the wire (6) and simultaneously the  spool (3) is rotated to pay out sufficient cord (9) to layer the  plant.  rotation of the spool is controlled by means of ribs (14)  on a flange (12) of the spool which engage with the horizontal  support wire.
