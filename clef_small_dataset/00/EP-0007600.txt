</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
&alpha;-difluoromethyl amino acids and pharmaceutical composition containing the same background of tke invention the present invention is concerned with novel a-fluoromethyl tyrosines and esters thereof. an unsubstitute4 a-fluoromethyl-aamino alkanoic acid, namely 2-fluoromethylalanine, having the formula: emi1.1 is known ixollonitsch et al., j. org. chem. 40. 3808-9 (1975)j. no specific pharmacological activity for this compound is suggested. this compound (a) is prepared by fluorodehydroxylation of the corresponding 2-hydroxymethylalanine. a-mithyl-m-tyrosine and a-methyl-p- tyrosine are known (u.s. 2,868,818). their use in pharmaceutical compositions is described in u.s. 3,322,630, u.s. 3,839,585 and canadian patent 737,907. l-a-methyl-p-tyrosine is also used to treat hypertension in pheochromocytoma. a-trifluoromethyl tyrosines are described in u.s. 3,046,300. these compounds deplete norepinephrine in the heart. a-difluoromethyl tyrosines and esters having pharmaceutical activity have been discovered. summary of the invention a-difluoromethyl tyrosines and esters thereof. description of the preferred embodiments an embodiment of the present invention is compounds having the formula emi2.1 where r is -nh2 and r1 is h or cl-clnalkyl. the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the formula i compounds are also included. in general, the salts are those of the formula i base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. preferred inorganic acid salts are the hydrohalides e.g. hydrochlorides, hydroiodides, hydrobromides; the sulfates, and the phosphates. the hydrohalides, and especially the hydrochlorides, are more preferred. the formula i compounds have a chiral center and may occur in optically active forms i.e., as optical isomers. these isomers are designated conventionally by the symbols l and d, + and -, 1 and d, s and r or combinations thereof. where the compound name or formula has no isomer designation, the name or formula includes the individual isomer mixtures thereof and racemates. the compounds having the s-isomer configuration are, in general, preferred. r1 is h or c1-c18alkyl. examples of suitable alkyl groups are methyl, octadecyl, 2-ethyihexyl, t-butyl, hexyl, isopropyl, ethyl, undecyl and the like; cl-c6alkyl is preferred and ethyl is especially preferred. h is a most preferred definition of r1. preferred formula i compounds are those where oh is in the 3 or 4 position with the 4 position being more preferred. preferred formula iii esters have x, as cl-c6alkyl, especially ethyl. r is h in the more preferred formula iii compounds. especially preferred formula iii compounds are a-difluoromethyl-mtyrosine and a-difluoromethyl-p-tyrosine. a-difluoromethyl-p-tyrosine is most preferred. the compounds of the present invention have antihypertensive activity. this activity is determined, in vivo, by observing the effect of a compound on blood pressure ln a spontaneously hypertensive rat. a representative compound of formula i was administered intrapritoneally to an (sh) rat and was found to have antihypertensive activity. the compound was also found to have enhanced antihypertensive activity when administered to an (sh) rat which had been pre-treated with the decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa[s-a-hydrazino-a-methyl-ss-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) -propionic acid monohydrate) the observed antihypertensive effect indicates that the present compounds are effective as antihypertensive agents when administered orally or parenterally either alone or in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor in suitable amounts in an appropriate pharmaceutical dosage form
