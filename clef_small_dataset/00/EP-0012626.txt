<ABSTRACT>
a solid-fuel gas generator (1) generates extremely clean  odorless nitrogen gas by a combustion process that involves  the burning in an annular combustion chamber (28) having  gas discharge orifices (24) of a gas-generant composition  (68) having combustion products including alkali metal ox­ ides and/or hydroxides and which may also include iron parti­ cles.  between the gas-generant composition (68) and the gas  discharge orifices (24) is disposed an annular primary cooling  and filtering pack (70) which includes a fine mesh screen (76)  surrounding the gas-generant composition and one or more  layers (74) of fiberglass woven fabric around the screen, the  glass being selected for its characteristic property at the  combustion chamber temperature of reacting with the alkali  metal oxides or hydroxides in the combustion products to  form innocuous alkali metal silicate and of becoming tacky to  enhance particle entrapment.  disposed in surrounding rela­ tion with the combustion chamber is an annular secondary  cooling and filtering pack (78) including a porous layer of alu­ minum silicate (82) which reacts with alkali metal oxide or hy­ droxide residue to form innocuous alkali metal silicate.  the gas generator is of particular interest for inflating  safety cushions in passenger carrying vehicles upon danger­ ous collision.

<DESCRIPTION>
fi od of and apparatus for gas generation bzckground of the invention field of the invention this invention relates to a gas generator that utilizes the combustion of a solid gas generant composition for the rapid generation of an extremely clean gas in which most of the combustion particle residue and noxious and offensive gases have been removed. the generator is particularly useful for rapidly filling vehicle inflatable cushion restraint systems for the protection of the occupants from severe impact and possible injury during a collision. description of the prior art gas generators that utilize combustible solid gas generant compositions are known in the prior art. common features of such generators that are used for the inflation of cushion restraint systems are the inclusion in a housing of a gas generant ccmpcsition containing a pelletized alkali metal azide and means to filter and to cool the gas positioned between the composition and gas discharge orifices, as defined by the housing. such compositions are considered advantageous for use in such applications because the product of cambustion is mainly nitrogen, an inert gas, and the speed of reaction or burning thereof, upon ignition, may be selected to be such as to effect the generation of gas at a very rapid rate but without detonation. such constituents that burn rapidly, however, usually burn with a temperature of about 10000c, and develop a pressure in the housing in excess of 140 kggsq cm (2000 psia) further, the gas that is generated contains combustion residue including molten particles of metal and/or reactant oxides and also noxious and offensive gases. the high pressure that builds up in the housing tends to produce an explosive discharge of residue from the housing. accordingly, among the problems associated with such prior art gas generators has been the containment of the high pressure reaction within a housing of acceptable weight and bulk, and adequate filtering and cooling of the generated gas. various chemical and mechanical cooling moans that have been provided have been found to be either unreliable after extended periods, unacceptably bulky, and/or incapable of reducing - the generated gas temperature to a desirably low level. the filtering means that have been provided have also been incapable of reducing the combustion residue entrained in the gas to a desirably low level. in each case the result is discomfort to the vehicle occupants who have been spared severe impact during a collision. a a proposal made in the prior art for reducing the temperature of the generated gas, as disclosed in u. s. patent 3,985,076, granted october 12, 1976, is to promote both the cooling and speed of the reaction by a mechanical arrangement of a pelletized gas generant composition, ignition means therefor, and means for filtering and the cooling, thereby allowing the use of a cooler burning gas generant. that is to say, the gas generant composition is disposed to surround the ignition means so that a greater proportion of the gas generant material is directly exposed to the
