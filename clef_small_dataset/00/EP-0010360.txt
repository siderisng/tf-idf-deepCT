<ABSTRACT>
the disclosure relates to 9β-aryloxy prostane derivatives,  for example 16-(3-chlorophenoxy) -11α, 15α-dihydroxy-16  methyl-9β-phenoxy -18, 19, 20-trinor-5-cis, 13-trans­ prostadienoic acid, which possess high activity as abortifa­ cients, cervical softeners, inducers of parturition or inhibitors  of gastric acid production in mammals.  these properties are  typical of prostaglandin analogues of the e series, but chemi­ cally the new 9β-aryloxy prostane derivatives are prostaglan­ din f series analogues and are therefore more stable than the  e series analogues previously used for the above purposes.   the new derivatives are manufactured by known analogy  processes, and are formulated in conventional manner.
