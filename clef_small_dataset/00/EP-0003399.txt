<ABSTRACT>
c₁ to c₃ mono-carboxylic acids, including a substantial  proportion of acetic acid, are produced by oxidising a  paraffinic hydrocarbon feedstock with molecular oxygen at a  temperature in the range 150 to 250°c and at an elevated  pressure sufficient to maintain the reactants in the liquid  phase in the presence as catalyst, of phosphoric acid and/or a  phosphate of one or more metals of groups i and ii of the  periodic table, in particular sodium or potassium.  in an  alternative embodiment of the invention a co-catalyst in the  form of one or more metals of variable valency, particularly  manganese, is incorporated in the reactants.  the reaction  products are recovered by distillation.
