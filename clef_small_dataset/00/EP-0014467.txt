<ABSTRACT>
an improved process for melt cutting ethylene polymers  is provided wherein the improvement comprises adding to  the melt cutter water a small amount of non-ionic or anionic  surfactants thereby significantly increasing the  agglomeration temperature of the ethylene polymer.  this  allows for an increase in melt cutting capacity and  productivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
title improved process for melt cutting ethylene polymers background of the ifiention field of the invention this invention relates to melt cutting and more specifically it relates to an improved process for the melt cutting of ethylene polymers. description of the prior art the use of surfactants is wide spread in many applications. for example, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide copolymer surfactants are disclosed in u.s.p. 3,422,049, and 3,432,483, as aiding the preparation of dispersions of polymers with particle sizes of below 10 microns to not greater than 25 microns and in u.s.p. 4,007,247 for the preparation of fibrils, i.e., short fibers having diameters less than 25 microns and preferably less than 10 microns. all three of these patents disclose water dispersion processes for polymer particle size reduction using high temperatures and pressures as well as high speed agitation and surfactants. u.s.p. 3,528,841 deals with reducing the tackiness of polymer pellets by applying a small particle size (less than 10 microns) polyolefin powder dispersed in water on the surface of the soft, sticky polymer to reduce its tackiness. in the alternative, the polyolefin powder coating can also be applied to the polymer by tumbling or by airveying. the purpose of applying this coating is to facilitate getting the product through the drying and purge steps of the production process and to supply a fre flowing product to the trade. chemical abstracts digest 37:153195p, vol. 87, 1977 p. 48, entitled agglomeration prevention during steam-stripping of solvents from rubber solutions" involves the use of a 1000-3000 molecular weight ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer as a surfactant in a water/hydrocarbon solvent dispersion. thus, a 20% solids butadiene rubber solution in hexane was steamstriped in a 0.005 weight percent solution of the above surfactant in water. this mixture forms a dispersion (oil in water at about 5 to 6 % solids) arc establishes the particle size of the rubber crumbs (average diameter 3@7mm). the surfactant's function is to make the to incompatible phases, namely, hexane and water ir.to one compatible phase. steam stripping is used to obtain a single liquid (water) phase, ending up with an 88 solids slurry. the process involves forming a particle size in dispersion form from a solution of the rubber in a hydrocarbon solvent. summary of the invention according to the present invention there is provided an improved process for melt cutting ethylene polymers, which process comprises extruding the molten thermoplastic polymer through one cr more orifices into water and cutting the extruded strand as it undergoes solidification, wherein the improvement comprises adding to the water from about 1 to aoout 1000 ppm by weight of at least one surfactant selected from the group consisting of non-ionic and anionic surfactants that will increase by at least lo2c the agglomeration temperature of an ethylene polymer that has an agglomeration temperature of from about 500c. to about 600c., said surfactant having a hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (hlb) range of from about 10 to about 45. detailed description of the invention surprisingly it was found
