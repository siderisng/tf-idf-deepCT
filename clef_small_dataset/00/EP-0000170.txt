<ABSTRACT>
To control a development or etching process, the workpiece (6) to be corrosive or the layer to be developed will be provided, for example, a semiconductor tube serving for the production of integrated circuits, provided with a lattice structure (G). This lattice turf is generated by the etching or development process simultaneously with the desired structures for producing the desired straps or from this recessed area of ​​the workpiece. To determine if the etched or developed areas their target form, d. H. The prescribed width or depth or the prescribed course of the edge profiles have achieved, a light beam is directed to the resulting lattice structure during the etching or development process and measured the intensity of the resulting two diffraction order. The lattice structure is designed so that when the target mold is reached, the second diffraction order disappears or a minimum DURC is running, whereby the termination of the etching or development process is displayed with great accuracy.
