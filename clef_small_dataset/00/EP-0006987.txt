<DESCRIPTION>
"benzylpyrimidine compositions" the present invention relates to 2,4-diamino-5 benzylpyrimidines, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to processes for preparing them and their compositions and to their use in the treatment of bacterial infections. certain 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidine have been demonstrated to exhibit useful pharmaceutical properties and to be sulphonamide potentiators. thus, u.k. patent specification no 875,562 discloses inter alia compounds of the formula ±1): emi2.1 wherein r1, r2 and r3 are the same or different c1-4 alkoxy groups. trimethoprim, 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5- trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine, is specifically disclosed in u.k. patent no.875,562 and is the most active general antibacterial agent amongst the 2,4-diamino 5-benzylpyrimidines known to date. trimethoprim has been used extensively over the last decade in human therapy in combination with various sulphonamides, and in particular with sulphamethozazole, for the treatment of bacterial infections, and has been recommended for the treatment of neisseria gonorrhaea (rodin and seth, brit. j. vener. dis, 1972, 48 517)* 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidines having a hydroxy group in the 4-positicn of the phenyl ring and possessing antibacterial activity are disclosed in li k. patent no. 1,128,234 and belgian patent no.846,397. 10). a process for preparing a compound of the formula (vii) which comprises: (i) the reaction of a compound of the formula (viii): emi3.1 wherein l is a leaving group, with the appropriately substituted phenol of the formula (ix): emi3.2 wherein r12 and r13 are as hereinbefore defined, (i) the reaction of a compound of the formula cx): emi3.3 wherein z is a hydroxy or disubstituted amino group or a halogen atom and r12 and r13 are as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula (xi): : emi4.1 wherein y is a hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkylthio, aralkylthio or mercapto group, and then, in the case where y is an alkylthio or aralkylthio group, removing this group by hydrogenolysis, (iii) cleaving a group r14, wherein r14 is a protecting group as hereinbefore defined, from a compound of the formula (xii): emi4.2 wherein r12, r13 are as hereinbefore defined, (iv) the reaction of a compound of the formula (xiii): emi4.3 intermediates in the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds they were not themselves disclosed as having any pharmacological activity. it has now been found that a group of compounds 7 9 within the formula (v) wherein r and r are the same or different c24 alkyl groups are extremely active in vitro and in vivo against the bacteria neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis, many of the compounds within this group are more than twice as active in vivo as trimethoprim against these nesseria organisms and in some cases they are as much as 15 times more active than trimethoprini in vitro. this discovery has extremely important implications in the field of hyman therapy in view of the recent discovery (new scientis, 28th april 1977)pp. 202, 205 of penicillin resistant strain of neisseria. penicillins have previously been widely used in the treatment of neisseria. these compounds are also useful and effective in the treatment of infections in mammals caused by anaerobic microorganisms such as
