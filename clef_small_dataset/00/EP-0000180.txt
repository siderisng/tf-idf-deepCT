<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor cell structure for use in a bucket circuit diagram contains the combination of a MOS capacitance with a MOSFET assembly to form a charge transfer cell. It is arranged on one side of the drind diffusion (104) and connected to it a thin ion-implanted drain abrade (107), which is separated from the adjacent drain diffusion (104 ') from a short channel region (105). Over the channel area (105) and the ion implanted drain enlargement region (107), a continuous thin oxide film of uniform thickness (110) below the gate (112) is present. This increases the efficiency of charge transmission of cell to cell and reduces the sensitivity of the threshold voltage to the source drain voltage. The gate (112) of the cell overlaps the drain for the most part and only to a small part of the source, the gate-drain capacitance per unit area is maximized by maintaining the uniform thin oxide layer (110) above the gate area. This semiconductor cell structure for a bucket circuit can be realized in integrated technology with other logical FET arrangements for reduced parasitic capacities on a high integration density chip.
