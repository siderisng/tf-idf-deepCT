<ABSTRACT>
A thyristor is described, which allows for maximum current rise speeds that are at least about a factor of 2 higher than this is possible with known thyristors. This is achieved by a shift of the ignition channel from the cathode edge (5) to internal cathode regions. This shift is caused by the fact that at those facing the anode zone opposing the gate-side cathode emitter range (5), the anode metallization is missing and the anode zone at these points is only weakly doped. Particularly advantageous, the new thyristor structure in conjunction with a voltage rise speed, du / dt, thyristor-enhancing shower ring (3) can be used. While in known thyristors the ignition front would be stopped at this shower ring and therefore it could easily come to overheating in these places, thyristors skip with the new structure of the Shortring from the ignition front.
