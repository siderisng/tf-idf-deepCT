<ABSTRACT>
an arrangement for the feeding of objects to and  grouping them on a base.  in order to simplify handling and transport of milk  packages it is frequent to use transport packages in the  form of trays (3) or the like, onto which a number of milk  packages (16) are placed in close stacking.  for this purpose  automatic machinery is used, which machinery automatically  loads the milk packages on a transport package  placed in position for loading.  in order to avoid interruptions  when an empty tansport package has to be substituted  for a filled one this invention suggests an arrangement  according to which the milk packages are first  collected in close stacking on a pre-loading surface (19).   thereafter, when the new transport package has been  brought in correct position adjacent to the pre-loading  surface, the collected milk packages are transferred onto  the transport package.
