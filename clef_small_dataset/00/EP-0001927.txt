<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a process for the production of highly  aromatic reformates in high yield from a naphtha feed  fraction by high-severity catalytic reforming using a reforming  catalyst which includes a hydrocracking promotor metal.   the process comprises reforming the stock under conditions  of high severity in a plurality of sequentially arranged  reaction zones in which the concentration of the hydrocracking  promotor metal of the reforming catalyst is adjusted to  provide a minimal hydrocracking activity relative to the other  reforming reactions to the catalyst in the first reaction zones,  and an enhanced hydrocracking activity to the catalyst in the  last reaction zones.  the reformates produced according to  this process are particularly useful in the blending of high  aromatic content gasoline and/or in the production of high  purity aromatic hydrocarbons.
