<ABSTRACT>
a control system is adapted to operate a fluid load (11) by  output of a variable delivery pump (10) having a control cylinder  (12) governed by flow and pressure responsive means for  regulating the displacement of the pump (10).  a flow control  valve (13) has input and output ports (16, 17) connected  respectively to the pump (10) and load (11) and by cooperation  of a spool (33), subject at one end to pump pressure  via pilot passage (44) and at the other end to a biasing force  provided by a spring (34), with orifices (42, 43) provides a  pump discharge flow that is inversely proportional to pump  discharge pressure.  a load sense control valve (14) has a  spring biased spool (48) subject at one end to load pressure  over a first pilot line (24) and subject at its other end to pump  pressure over a second pilot line (23).  a land (55) on the spool  (48) determines the connection of the control cylinder (12)  either to pump pressure at port (53) for regulating the delivery  of the pump or to atmosphere at port (56) for relieving the  regulation.  by this means the pump displacement is adjusted  to maintain substantially constant horsepower output under  variable load conditions whereby the load (11) can utilize  substantially constant horsepower approaching a prime  mover input torque curve without requiring mechanical feedback  indicative of the displacement of the pump (10).
