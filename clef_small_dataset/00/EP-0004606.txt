<ABSTRACT>
an improved process is provided for the production of  thioalkyl aniline compounds, which are known and useful as  intermediates for producing anthelmintic, antibacterial and  fungicidal benzimidazole compounds.  according to the  process a thiocyano aniline compound, an alcohol and an  alkali metal cyanide are reacted, with the additional presence  of an alkyl halide, and also with a dipolar aprotic solvent, or  in the preence of an immiscible solvent and a phase transfer  catalyst.  a further improvement consists of providing said  phase transfer catalyst as a polymer-bound catalyst.
