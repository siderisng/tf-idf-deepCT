<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for performing single-axis or multi-axial  dynamic tests on large structures made of composite materi­ als, which apparatus comprises, for each stress axis to be  tested, a loading cable (1,7) for applying a force to a single-­ axis or multi-axial test-piece (6), either in tension or in com­ pression, a hydraulic jack (3) for tensioning the cable (1,7), a  structure (4) for anchoring the cable (1,7) optionally at discrete  intervals along its length, a stopping and release device (13)  for securing the cable (1,7) at one end before the test and for  propagating a load wave to the test-piece (6) secured at the  other end of the cable (1,7), a recoil shock-absorber (16), and  at least one device (11,12) for limiting lateral oscillations of the  cable (1,7).

<DESCRIPTION>
's single-axis or sulti-axial apparatus for dynamic = - tq on large structures", the present invention relates to apparatus for performing single--axis or multi-axial dynamic tests on large structures. the constituent dynamic equations are a very important parameter in the study of incidents in nuclear reactors and dynamically stressed structures in general. a knowledge of these equations is essential not only for homogeneous materials, such as steel, but also for composite structures such as a section of the reactor core or a reinforced concrete structure. a homogeneous material can be studied in small test-pieces, whereas in order to study a composite structure or material, it ir necessary to have a relativcly large cross-section in ordcr to represent the entire material, which can then be considered as homogeneous. in order to analyze the data and apply them to actual situations, it is also necessary to know the constituent equation under conditions of combined forces or with a stepped load diagram. test apparatuses exist for the first case (see italian patent specification no. 985 074 dated 16th may 1973), but for the second case there are no known apparatuses which are adequate to perform tests requiring heavy loads, rapid application of the load, and a long duration of loading under conditions where the force of the load is closely controlled. the apparatus described in the afore-mentioncd patent is not suitable for direct application to heavy loads since the device for release of the load comprises a fragile intermediate member vhich has prohibitive 8jmensions. purthermore, since the loads in question are large, special precautions are necessary with regard to the satiety of the installation during testing, e.g. in the case of the hydraulic jack for tensioning the cable and the braking means for preventing the cable fro being compressed. to obviate the afore-mentioned limitations, the present invention provides a novel apparatus for studyin the behaviour of materials with continually increasing stages of stress, and for investigating the strain hardening of materials due to successive plastic deformation thereof, with particular regard to the dynamics of large structures under heavy, rapidly changing loads according to the main feature of the invention the proposed apparatus comprises, for each stress axis to be tested, a loading cable for applying a force to the test-piece, either in tension or in compression, a hydraulic jack for tensioning the cable, a structure for securing the cable, optionally at discrete intervals along ito length, a stopping and releasing device for securing the cable before the test and for propagating a load wave to the test-piece after the release mechanism has been actuated, a recoil shock-absorber, and at least one device for limiting lateral oscillations of the cable. according to another feature of the invention, the cable-securing structure is tubular structure which operates under compression. according to another feature of the invention, the device for stopping and releasing the cable under tens"- comprises explosive bolts with electric detonators synchronized to a microsecond. one embodiment of an apparatus according to te present specification
