<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a connection, through a thermal cuff, a tributary conduit and a collector conduit.Connection according to the invention brings together a drive collar 1 and a conduit flush 2 which opens with a side opening 12 in said collector duct 1 and COM takes a tubular cuff 3 mounted along the axis 21 of the flue flow 2, whose mouth.input 33 is gathered with sealing said flue 2, whose end 31 is engaged in said lateral opening 12 forming an orifice, and it is characterized in that said cuff 3 has a shape that converges according to the axis.21 of the conduit flows, in the direction directed from the outside to the axis 11 of the collector conduit 1 and that it is fully implanted in the said conduit tributary 2. This connection can be used for a nuclear reactor piping.
