<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method and apparatus for  dynamically measuring vehicle front end parameters such as  tow-in (or toe-out) and camber angle.  the apparatus includes  a separate pair of support rollers (11) for supporting each  vehicle front wheel (10) and causing rotation thereof.  a sens­ ing roller (12) is adapted to contact the tyre tread surface at  the lowermost point of the tyre so as to be rotated by rotation  of the wheel.  the axis of the sensing roller (12) is arranged  transverse to the plane or rotation of the wheel (10) such that  any toe-in or toe-out of the wheel causes a transverse or  generally axial displacement of the sensing roller (12) to a  position wherein the axis of the sensing roller is normal to  the toe-in or toe-out direction of the wheel (10).  the sensing  roller (12) is mounted on an axle (13) which forms one bar of  a trapezium shaped four bar linkage (13,14,15) which causes  said sensing roller (12) to pivot about an effective pivot point  (16) which is arranged, by means of said linkage, a consider­ able distance away from the wheel (10).  the pivot point (16)  is the point of intersection of the centre lines of the tapered  sides (14) of the linkage since the bars of the linkage are  pivotally interconnected.  a further sensing roller for measur­ ing camber angle and methods of measuring toe-in and  camber angle are also disclosed and claimed.
