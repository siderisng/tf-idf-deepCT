<ABSTRACT>
the device essentially comprises an si crystal (19), that surface of which is not exposed to the light is in contact with a first semiconductor resin (18) which is constituted by a mixture of copper sulphide and of synthetic resin.  this si crystal is in contact with a second semiconductor resin (23), which is likewise constituted by a mixture of copper sulphide and of synthetic resin, and with a material (22) absorbing electrons, for example indium, embedded in the first resin, but separated from the latter by the second semiconductor resin (23).  this second resin contains approximately 5 to 20% more synthetic resin than the first resin.  the latter is supported by a conductive body (17) and connecting means (24, 25) are connected respectively to the conductive body and to the absorbing material.  it is possible to superpose a plurality of silicon crystals embedded in the first resin, for example of silicone.  the silicon crystal exposed to light is protected by a transparent insulating material (21).  <image>
