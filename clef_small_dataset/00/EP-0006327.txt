<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for spreading fibres uniformly over a form­ ing conveyor has separate fibre distributors (10, 12), these  deposit dry fibres onto a conveyor belt (60) which runs  through a tunnel (51) into which fibre-dispensing openings  of the distributors (10,12) discharge fibres.  to reduce the likelihood of fibres accumulating on  the tunnel walls (50 etc,) and possibly resulting in lumps  falling onto the conveyor belt (60), the tunnel has seals (52,  54) at its belt-entrance and belt-exit ends, and beneath-­ belt suction produced by a suction box (64) is such that air  flow into the tunnel through its sealed ends is insignificant.   the distributors (10, 12) are contiguously side-by-side, an  arrangement which minimizes the suction requirements.
