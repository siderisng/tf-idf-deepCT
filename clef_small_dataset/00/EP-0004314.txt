<ABSTRACT>
Packaging means made of paper, cardboard or plastic are pressed after their use to compact, transportable, cylindrical round bales. As a pressing device serve two endless conveyor belts (13, 14), which are each with each other with a band portion (25, 42) so that they form a wedge-shaped pressing chamber (12) which completes at its upper, wide wedge side by a guide roller (15) is and has only a feed gap (48) for the pressing material. The band portions (25, 42) run in the opposite direction, so that the supplied press material is wound into a solid roll. With washing diameter of the round bale, the two band portions (25, 42) retain to a maximum round bales size. One (13) of the conveyor belts is preferred via the pressing room (12) and forms a wall of a funnel-shaped plating space (11). It leads to bulky goods into the feed gap (48) for pressing space (12), wherein it is precused to a flat layer. The round bales are coated in the pressing device with a yarn strand (76, 79) spirally and then ejected by unfolding a (14) of the conveyor belts from the bale pressing device.
