<ABSTRACT>
an improved nozzle feed assembly for the injection mold­ ing of thermosetting materials includes a cylindrical  temperature-controlled member (17) having a closed end (23)  and an open end (21).  the open end is provided with a screw  thread (25) for attachment to the feed barrel of a conventional  screw-type molding machine.  the nozzle member has an  internal temperature controlling means (31) and a plurality of  feed outlets (37,39) positioned on the periphery of the nozzle  member near the closed end.  in use of the nozzle the tempera­ ture in the nozzle member can be kept sufficiently high to  maintain molding material within the nozzle member in a  plasticized state and sufficiently low that no substantial curing  of the molding material takes place.  in an alternative mode a  sleeve member is positioned around the periphery of the  nozzle member and movable to cover and uncover the feed  outlets in the periphery of the nozzle member.
