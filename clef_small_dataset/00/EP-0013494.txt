<ABSTRACT>
a non-contact system suitable for measuring veloc­ ity/distance of, an object travelling inside a ferromagnetic  pipeline utilizes magnetic dipoles written into the pipe surface  by a transmission coil.  these dipoles can be detected by a  magnetic detector situated a fixed distance from the trans­ mission point.  if the time taken for a dipole to travel from the  transmitter to the detector is recorded then this time will be  proportional to the velocity of the system.  the system therefore performs a dual role,   (a) as a velocity measurement device, and   (b) as a distance marker.  once the system detects a dipole it requests a further  imprint, hence, a constant spacing is maintained between  dipoles equal to the spacing between transmitter and detec­ tor.
