<ABSTRACT>
a servicing machine (3) for a steam generator (1) is accu足 rately set up in the generator channel head (11) with a pivoted  arm (63) mounted for rotation in a plane parallel to the  tubesheet (9).  the angular position of the arm (63), the lon足 gitudinal position of a carriage (81) mounted on the arm and  the vertical position of a platform (87) on the carriage are  remotely controlled to manoeuvre a probe (1 or 5) used in  mapping the precise location of the thousands of holes (23) in  the tubesheet.  various operations are then performed at each  precise hole location by tools carried by the arm mounted  carriage to prepare for installation of new tubing.  the opera足 tion of a pair of remotely controlled pivoted arms (63), one on  each side of the channel head divider plate (15), is coordinated  to automatically position the ends of u-shaped tubes in cor足 responding holes in the tubesheet on opposite sides of the  divider plate and to secure the same in place.
