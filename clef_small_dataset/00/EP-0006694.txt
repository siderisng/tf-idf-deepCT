<ABSTRACT>
a plasmid or phage gene for a periplasmic or extra-Â­ cellular bacterial protein is cleaved, a doublestranded dna  sequence coding for a selected protein or portion thereof  from a eukaryotic cell such as insulin is inserted in that  cleaved gene by recombinant dna techniques and used to  transform a bacterium, and the excreted selected protein is  collected.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field of inventionthis invention relates to a process for producing specific proteins in bacteria and having them excreted from the bacterial cell and pertains more specifically to inserting the dna representing the desired non-bacterial protein or part of a protein by recombinant techniques into the plasmid or phage gene for either a periplasmic or an extracellular protein, hereinafter called a "carried protein", transforming a bacterial host with the recombined gene, and culturing the transformed host to excrete the protein. the protein thus produced can be collected by conventional procedures from the culture medium or from the periplasmic space depending upon the choice of carrier protein gene. background artit is known to insert dna representing a specific protein into the gene for an intracellular protein. itakura et al, science 198, 1056 (1977). the problem however is that proteins made in this way are mixed with other intracellular proteins and are therefore subject to degradation by enzymes within the cell so that there is a problem in obtaining the desired protein product in purified form. disclosure of inventionthe foregoing problem is avoided in accordance with our invention by providing a method of making a selected protein or portion thereof by inserting dna representing the selected protein or portion thereof into a bacterial gene, characterized by cleaving the bacterial gene for an extracellular or periplasmic carrier protein, inserting into the cleavage site by a recombinant step a non-bacterial dna fragment which codes for the selected protein or portion thereof, transforming a bacterial host with the recombined gene, and culturing the transformed bacteria to excrete the selected protein or portion thereof. by way of example, by employing a gene for a carrier protein which has a leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at its amino terminus and which is normally excreted through the membrane of the cell within which it is made, with cleavage of the hydrophobic leader sequence during excretion, a selected protein can be produced which can be recovered either from the periplasmic space or from the medium in which the bacterium is grown, depending upon the choice of carrier protein. in this way contamination from the other proteins within the bacterium is avoided while achieving greater stability by avoiding the enzymes within the bacterial cell which degrade foreign proteins. among the bacterial genes for carrier proteins which genes can therefore be employed in the present invention are the genes for antibiotic resistance, such as the gene for penicillin resistance or possibly penicillinase, the gene for chloramphenicol resistance, or the gene for tetracycline resistance, as well as the gene for alkaline phosphatase and the gene for bacterial ribonuclease. genes or dna fragments which code for a variety of proteins or portions thereof can be inserted in the bacterial carrier protein gene by the process of the present invention. these proteins include a variety of non-bacterial proteins such as eukaryotic cell proteins and viral proteins. of particular importance are eukaryotic cell proteins such as insulin, human growth hormone, interferon and other pharmacologically
