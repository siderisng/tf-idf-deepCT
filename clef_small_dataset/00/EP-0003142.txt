<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure relates to a fitting including a nipple (10),  a collar (11) attached to the nipple, and a socket (12).  the  collar and the nipple are secured together by forming one or  more beads (17, 18) on the nipple.  the socket (12) is attached  to the nipple, collar and a length of hose (27) by crimping the  socket into tight contact with the hose and into interlocking  engagement with the collar (11).  a plurality of sockets of  different sizes may be provided to accommodate different  hose designs.  a socket appropriate for a specified hose  design is selected and assembled with the hose and nipple.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a hose fitting including a nipple, a collar attached to the nipple, and a socket. the invention also relates to a method of assembling such a fitting and a hose, comprising the steps of positioning the nipple in clamping jaws to hold it stationary, placing the collar on the nipple and securing the collar to the nipple. a hose coupling or fitting is shown in u.s. patents no. 3,924,883 and no. 4,006,524, wherein a tubular nipple is fitted with a reinforcing sleeve, and an outer metal socket is clamped to the nipple and the sleeve. the fitting is attached to a hose by positioning the end of the hose in a space between the sleeve and the socket, and then crimping the socket inwardly. the foregoing construction is disadvantageous in that it requires a reinforcing sleeve and, generally, a particular size fitting will work well with only one style or size of hose. it is among the objects of this invention to provide an improved fitting and method of assembly, which eliminates the foregoing disadvantages. according to one aspect of the invention there is provided a hose fitting comprising a tubular nipple, a collar positioned on said nipple and tightly assembled with said nipple, a socket positioned around said nipple and at least partially overlying said collar, characterised in that said collar, and said socket are formed separately and said socket and said ccllar include interengageable means for securing said socket to said collar upon reduction in the diameter of said socket as by crimping, and said collar and said nipple are tightly assembled by bead means formed on said nipple and engaging said collar. in preferred embodiments, a plurality of interchangeable sockets are provided, each having engaging means of the same size, said collar having engaging means for receiving said engaging means of a selected socket, each of said sockets further having a hose engaging portion of a different internal diameter whereby said fitting may be used with different size hose by selecting a socket having the appropriate internal diameter. according to another aspect of the invention there is prov-ded a method of assembling a fitting and a hose, said fitting comprising a nipple, a collar and a socket, comprising the steps of positioning said nipple in clamping jaws to hold said nipple stationary, placing said collar on said nipple and securing said collar to said nipple, characterised by forming beads on said nipple to secure said nipple to said collar, forming said socket separately from said collar and positioning said socket over said hose, inserting said nipple into said hose, moving said socket over the end portion of said hose and at least partially over said collar, and crimping said socket tightly on to said hose and said collar. embodiments of the invention are described below, by wr of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where in: figures 1, 2 and 3 are vies in axial section illustrating steps in assembling a hose
