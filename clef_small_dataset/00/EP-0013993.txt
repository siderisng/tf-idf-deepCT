<ABSTRACT>
1.  pressure regulator the set point of which can be controlled by a temperature sensor (16) by adjusting a spring force via a transmission lever (10), in particular for regulating the servo control pressure for a servo controlled gas valve, whereat a leaf spring (30) biased in accordance with the required minimum pressure acts upon a diaphragm (25) which carries the closure member (5) of a valve, and whereat a second leaf spring (46) abuts on one side against a counter piece which is adjustable within the housing and on the other side at low temperature additionally acts upon the diaphragm (25) whilst at high temperatures said second leaf spring can be rendered ineffective by means of the transmission lever (10) via an adjustable abutment catch (38) characterized in that a second transmission lever (81) is provided which is turnable around a stationary axis (82) and extends essentially in parallel to the first lead spring (30) ; that along this second transmission lever (81) a slider (83) is adjustable which acts upon the first leaf spring (30) ; and that the second leaf spring (46) carries a pin (85) which acts upon the second transmission lever (81).
