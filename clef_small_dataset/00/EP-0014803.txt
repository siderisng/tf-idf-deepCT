<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a process for preparing acrylonitrile  polymer fiber of hollow or open structure which comprises  extruding a homogeneous single phase fusion melt of  acrylonitrile polymer and water through a spinnerette whose  orifices are partially blocked by means of solid inserts, such as  strands of wire or removable pins.  the fusion melt is extruded  directly into a steam-pressurized solidification zone main­ tained under conditions of saturation, temperature and pres­ sure which control the release of water from the nascent  extrudate and maintain the extrudate in a plastic state.  while  in the solidification zone, the extrudate is stretched to provide  orientation of the polymer molecules.  the process can pro­ vide open and hollow structure acrylonitrile polymer fibers of  a wide variety of different cross-sectional shapes while emp­ loying spinnerettes which are readily constructed.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for ppeparing acrntonitrile polymer fi3e of hollow or open structure this invention relates to a process for preparing an acrylonitrile polymer fiber of modified cross-sectional shape. more particularly, this invention relates to such a process wherein a single phase fusion melt of acrylonitrile polymer and water is extruded through a spinnerette the orifices of which are partially blocked by solid inserts. recent developments in the art of spinning acrylonitrile polymer fiber have led to a fusion melt spin ning procedure, see u.s patent 4,163,770 issued august 7, 1979, to harold porosoff. in this procedure, an acrylonitrile polymer and water in proper proportions are heated to a temperature above the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure and under sufficient pressure to maintain water in liquid state. at appropriate temperature and pressure a homogeneous fusion melt of polymer and water will form at a temperature below the detericration ternparature of the polymer and at a temperature below which the polymer would normally melt with decomposition. in preferred embodiments, this fusion melt is extruded through a spinnerette directly into a steam-pressurized solidification zone maintained under conditions which prevent sheath-core structure in the cross section of the nascent filament and enable stretching to provide orientation of the polymer molecules to be accompli- shed while the extrudate remains within the solidlfica-ti n - one.' this process provides a rapidly solidified extrudate composition which upon exit from the spinnerette shows n tendency towards stickiness and hugh conformity to the shapc of the spinnerette orifices throu3h which it is spun. fibers having hollow or opcn crross-sectional shape are desirable for a number of reason . because of their structure such fibers have a higher extent of surface area than do conentional shaped fibers. this high surface aret consists of- both external surface area and internal -surface area of hollow and open structural modifications. this high surface area permits increased adsorption of water, dyes and other adsorbable materials. increased water adsorp tio'l provides greater comfort in wearing fabrics made from such fiber. the hollow or open structure aiso provides greater bulk than conventional fiber of the same denier. esthetic qualities such as handle or feel are also desirably faltered by the hollow or open structure and suitable structures can provide greater cover in fabric c-onstructions than conventional structures of the same denier fabrics constructed from the open structure fiber dry quicker than fabrics constructed from closed structure fiber because of their greater surface area. thus, although the desirability of hollow and open structure fibers is generally recognized, suitable processes for preparing such fiber have been diffi- cult to provide and only limited amounts of fiber of hollow and open structures have decome available. spinnerettes useful in providing hollow and open stricture fiber are extremely difficult to construct and require extremely expensive techniques to construct. spinnerettes useful in one type-of fiber-spinning process are not always useful in other typos of fiber-spinning processes. because of these restrictions very limited production of hollow and open structure fiber has been
