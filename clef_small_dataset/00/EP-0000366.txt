<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sheet feeder (1) with an in the transport direction (a) of the sheets of a stack (16) slidable suction chamber (3), which is bounded laterally from two walls (23, 24) and is movable between them. The suction chamber (3) has a cover plate (22) with a suction opening (21) and a base plate formed as a perforated plate (2). On the cover plate (22) is located above the suction opening (21) a fan (4), which lifts the at the top sheet (13) from the stack (16) during operation. Each of the walls (23, 24) has a transport direction (a) extending slot (25) in which rollers (26, 28) are guided, which is laterally in the slots (25) from the side walls of the suction chamber (3) extend. A drive motor (8) drives via a toothed belt drive (31, 33, 40) a cam (5) on a shaft which, the suction chamber (3) via a cam roll (6) against the tensile force of a spring (7) in the transport direction (A ) Moves.
