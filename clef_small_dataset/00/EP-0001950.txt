<ABSTRACT>
the emergency headlight system includes a fuse box (4) connected to the battery (1) when the starter motor relay (2) closes.  the fuses are then connected by a relay (5) with three contacts (6a, 6b, 6c) to further switches and then to the headlamps (11, 12) and tail lamps (13).  these switches include a safety relay (8) with one pair of contacts (9) normally closed when the lights are not switched on.  when the relay (5) is operated to switch the lights on, the three contacts (6a, 6b, 6c) close.  current can then flow through the dip switch (7) for main beam (12) illumination.  in the event of a fuse blowing, the safety relay operates so that the low beam filaments (11) are in circuit.  the headlight is for vehicles, including motorcycles and sea and air craft.  in the event of headlamp failure, due to a fuse blowing, faulty switch contacts etc. , full beam filaments can be switched on to replace the low beam filaments being used, or vice versa.
