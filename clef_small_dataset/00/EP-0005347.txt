<ABSTRACT>
a rock splitting attachment for a breaking hammer  for use in cracking or splitting large rocks or breaking  up concrete slabs.  the attachment comprises a main shaft (22) carrying  first wedge means (23) at one end, the first wedge  means (23) having a plurality of exterior wedge surfaces  (24) co-operating with interior wedge surfaces (42) of  second wedge means (30) connected to the main shaft  (22) for relative axial movement, the attachment being so  arranged that axial movement of the main shaft (22) towards  the second wedge means (30) causes engagement  of the wedge surfaces of the two wedge means to force the  parts (40) of the second wedge means (30) radially outwardly  of the axis of the main shaft (22).
