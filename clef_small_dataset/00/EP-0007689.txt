<ABSTRACT>
a process for preparing the methanolate crystalline form  of sodium cefamandole which comprises the step of mixing at  a temperature between about 20°c.  and about 30°c.  a sus­ pension of sodium o-formylcefamandole in methyl alcohol  having a ratio of about one gram of sodium  o-formylcefamandole for between about 2. 5 ml.  and about  3. 5 ml.  of methyl alcohol, said suspension containing  between about 1. 5 percent and about 3 percent by volume of  water, with a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide in  methyl alcohol in an amount corresponding to about 1 ml.  of  said concentrated solution per gram of sodium  o-formylcefamandole in said suspension.  the crystalline  sodium cefamandole methanolate can be separated from the  suspension and converted to sodium cefamandole anhydrate  for pharmaceutical use.
