<ABSTRACT>
a testing apparatus for making photometric measurements  with a light beam having a spatially ill-defined energy distribution.   a detector (29, 30; 91) for receiving the light beam  and having a spatial variation in its sensitivity over its sensing  area.  a diffuser (91, 97) is provided which is disposed in  the light beam for intercepting the light beam before it strikes  the detector.  the diffuser is formed of a white-like plastic and  has a thickness which decreases progressively towards the  outer edged of the same to compensate for the fall-off in  sensitivity of the detector to rays closer to the outer margins  of the diffuser or away from the center of the diffuser.  the  diffuser is formed in two portions in which a portion (97) of  the diffuser is in substantially closer proximity to the detector  (91) than the other portion to minimize the directional sensitivity  of the detector.
