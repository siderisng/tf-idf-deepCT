<ABSTRACT>
a power supply comprises at least two supply circuits the output terminals of which are connected in series to supply a voltage across a load (vl).  each circuit comprises a d. c.  voltage source (vm) in series with a switching valve (s), the maximum voltage across which is limited by diodes (d1) connected across the output terminals of the respective supply terminals, and a protection circuit (4).  the protection circuit responds to the current flowing through the load, and on the occurrence of a first current threshold switches off the valve (s), and in the event of a higher current threshold fires a crowbar link (i) which shunts the source (vm).
