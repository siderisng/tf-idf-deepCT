<ABSTRACT>
a supply or demand margin valve for use in hydraulic  systems having at least one load provided with hydraulic  fluid under pressure by a main pump, a pilot pump and at  least one control valve for the load.  the margin valve includes  a valve body having a bore with a spool reciprocally  received within the bore.  a first port in the body extends  to the bore and is adapted to be connected to the pilot  pump.  a second port in the body extends to the bore and  spaced in relation to the first port and is adapted to be  connected to a component of a hydraulic system other than  a pilot pump.  a spring is disposed in the valve body for  applying a biasing force to the spool to urge the spool in  one direction and a third port is in fluid communication  with the pressure responsive surface and is adapted to be  connected to a main pump so as to apply a force to the  spool to urge the spool in the same direction as the spring.   a fourth port connects with a pressure responsive surface  for applying a force to the spool in bucking relation to the  spring and a feedback passage in connection with an additional  pressure responsive surface is in fluid communication  with the second port for applying an additional force  to the spool in bucking relation to the spring.
