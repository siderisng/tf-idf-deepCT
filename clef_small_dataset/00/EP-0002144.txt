<ABSTRACT>
1.  piston for pneumatic spring or other telescopic system with a cylinder (1) and plunger rod (6), the piston (7) being designed to be slidably fitted in teh cylinder (1) for guiding therein the plunger rod (6) and subdividing it into two pneumatic chambers located on both sides of the piston (7) and connected with each other via a calibrated passage (74) formed through the piston (7) which, while being cast solid and constituted entirely of one and a single homogeneous moulded piece, presents an elaborate geometrical shape defined by an annular indentation (75) which extends all around a practically indeformable, bulky central core (76) and which separates the latter from a flexible peripheral skirt (77) tightly and slidably engaging the wall of the cylinder (1), characterized in that the material of this single-piece piston (7) thus shaped is an acetal resin (formaldehyde polymer) and in that the flexibility of the peripheral skirt (77) provides from its connection (78) to the bulky central core (76), which is located at the level of the annular indentation (75) to constitute the bottom (75b) thereof and which operates so as to speak as a sham hinge for said skirt (77).
