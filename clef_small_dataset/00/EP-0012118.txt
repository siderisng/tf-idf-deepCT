<ABSTRACT>
the invention is related to an improved diaphragm valve  of water valves of the kind wherein a yieldable resilient diahragm  (15), centrally reinforced by a plate (25) of stiff material,  forms, from part to part, the valve closing the water passage  and, from opposite part, forms a pressure chamber, so that  the valve opening and closing take place with the establishment  respectively of a pressure and a pressure drop being  determined by a closing member operated by the movable  core of a solenoid, said plate in stiff material is provided with a  peripheral undercutting (32) which in the coupling with the  central zone of the diaphragm (15) forms an annular channel,  spacing takes being provided to maintain open said  peripheral channel, the latter communicating in turn with an  annular channel praticated on the face of the diaphragm portion  contacting said plate (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
imdrovements in diaphragm valves of water valves, particularlv for washing machines this invention is related to improvements in diaphragm valves of the water valves employed particularly in washing machines, such as dish-washing machines or linenwashing machines for home use. water valves of said kind are known in the prior art, wherein the water way is controlled by. a diaphragm valve operating in such a way that its closing and its opening is caused by the pressure of the supply line feeding the washing machine in cooperation with a movable member moved by the movable core of a solenoid valve. such a diaphragm valve includes a resilient diaphragm being peripherally flexible and centrally stiffened by a plate. the diaphragm is fixed in a way that, from a part, it acts with the rigid portion on a valve seat opened towards the outlet, while, from the other part, defines a pressure chamber communicating through a first hole with the water riÂ±-z under pressure and through a second hole with the outlet. the operation of the valve takes place by actuating the movable member moved by the solenoid valve core, that is when the solenoid is de-energized, the closing member with the movable core is pushed by a light spring to close the communication duct between the pressure chamber and the valve outlet, so that inside said pressure chamber, water enters increasing the pressure on the diaphragm and holding the latter in a closing position against the valve seat. on the contrary, when the solenoid is energized, the core is attracted together with the closing member, enabling the duct communicating with the outlet to pass water from the pressure chamber to the outlet, causing a pressure drop an said chamber, so as the diaphragm will be raised from the same pressure of the coming water. the valves of said kind are generally operable for pressures above a certain value, but they are particularly defective for light pressures, as they are unable to guarantee a stable closing and opening. said disadvantages are caused above all by the limited peripheral flexibility of the diaphragm, which offers in this way a certain resistance to the light pressure of the water and to adherence phenomena between the same diaphragm and the plate preventing the diaphragm zone facing the plate from participating to flexion movements of the same diaphragm. another disadvantage is that such is the diaphragm flexion during the opening phase tah said diaphragm can adhere to the upper wall of thn pressure chamber showing a certain inertia during the closing phase, said inertia increasing, of course, in case of water supplied by light pressure. this invention eliminates said disadvantages and alloy the diaphragm to safely operate also in case of light pressure of the supply water to this end the improved diaphragm valve of the present invention is .characterised in that the plate coupled with the central zone of the diaphragm is provided with a peripheral undercutting which, in the coupling with said diaphragm central zone,
