<ABSTRACT>
a first sleeve member (12) has a slightly enlarged  diameter portion (14) at one end thereof and a second sleeve  member (20) has one end telescopically received within the  enlarged diameter portion (14) such that said first and  second sleeve members (12, 20) are movable between  expanded and contracted positions.  a third sleeve member  (26) is fixed to the outer surface of the second sleeve  member (20) and extends axially about the enlarged diameter  portion (14) and a portion of the smaller diameter  portion of the first sleeve member (12).  the third sleeve  member (26) is radially spaced from the first sleeve member  (12) forming a pressure chamber (28) which communicates  with the interior of said sleeve members through ports (18)  formed in the enlarged diameter portion (14).  thus, fluid  pressure acts in the pressure chamber (28) to counteract  separation forces in an associated pipeline.  first packing  means (32, 34, 36) is carried on the end of the third sleeve  member (26) adjacent the first sleeve member (12) and is in  sealing engagement therewith; second packing means  (42, 44, 54) is carried on the free end of the enlarged diameter  portion (14) between the second and third sleeve members  (20, 26) and is in sealing engagement therewith.  the second  packing means (42, 44, 54) includes a gland (42) and an  elongated filer tube (52) extending from the gland (42)  between the second and third sleeve members (20, 26) and  terminates between the third sleeve member (26) whereby it  is accessible and the second packing means (42, 44, 54) can be  repacked without dismantling the joint assembly or interrupting  the flow of fluid in the associated pipeline.
