<ABSTRACT>
1.  fault current circuit breaker which is capable of detecting a. c.  fault currents, d. c.  components and smooth d. c.  fault currents, and which operates on the principe of a summation transformer through the annular core (900) of which pass conductors (900a, 900b, 900c, 900d) which carry the operating current, characterized in that at least one further conductor (903) is arranged inside the annular core (900) itself at least along an annular zone approximately on the central line (901), and is connected to a pulse generator (917) for frequencies which are higher than the mains frequency, the pulses of which are arranged to be such that the core attains magnetic saturation.
