<ABSTRACT>
The conducting of high-frequency elek trischer and electromagnetic waves is made of a pristine-resistant frame (2) known per se, in which the free space between the individual lines (8) and the Rah Men (2) by moderately tailor over- and side-by-side molding completely or Partially elastic feet (5) is fully completed, one of which is the number of two parts corresponding to the number of lines (8). These are provided with outgoing from their touch surfaces, the cross-section in each case a line (8) according to the shape and size recesses (9,10) and stand with the remaining fittings (5) under the frame plane we kendem pressure, through which they with each other with each other The lines (8) and with the frame wall in dense system kept. At the leads through the frame (2) for leading lines (8), a circumferential groove (14) is formed in the region of the frame plane in the jacket of the Leitun gene (8) which is up to the shielding coating (16) of the line (8) extending and which serve to accommodate a bracket (12, 10) formed in the recesses (9, 10) of the fittings (5). Then, each lei device (8) is placed in two pitch halves (6, 7) of a fitting (5). The fittings (5) with the lines (8) and there are additional zero pieces (3,4) are then filled in the frame opening. Diagonally, fittings (5) and zero pieces (3,4) of the type are pressed against each other and against the frame (2), that in the elastic, in the case of heat swellable material embedded, electrically conductive particles are shifted to each other, that The fittings (5) and zero pieces (3,4) are electrically conductive via their entire cross-section and water, gas and fireproof.
