<ABSTRACT>
a cap for a jar, the cap being of sheet metal and (consiÂ­ dered in its attitude of use) comprising a top panel (2), a skirt  (4) depending from the periphery of the top panel, and an  internal continuous circumferential bead (6) on the lower  edge of the skirt.  hitherto such a bead has been deformed  inwards at intervals to provide internal lugs to engage an  interrupted thread, or a continuous bead, on a jar, but the lugs  have not performed reliably.  in the present cap the bead  (considered in plan) consists of alternate arcuate portions (8)  and straight portions (10), the arcuate portions being at a  uniform radius from a common centre (12), and the straight  portions being tangent to a common imaginary circle (14)  around that common centre.  dies for the manufacture of the  caps include inserts for shaping the straight portions (10).
