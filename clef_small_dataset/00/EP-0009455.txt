<ABSTRACT>
1.  a device for heat exchange by direct contact of solid particles flowing under gravity and a gaseous stream ascending in a column comprising at least one stage (12) formed of a stack (12a) of packing elements arranged on a support (12b), the device being characterized in that so that a dense fluidized bed is not formed in contact with said support (12b), the opening ratio of the support (12b) is equal to at least 75 % of the porosity of the stack (12a) of packing elements, the loss of pressure of the gaseous stream through this support (12b) being negligible in relation to that through the stack (12a) and the mean velocity of the gaseous stream in the stage (12a) being from 1 to 1. 5 times the mean velocity in free fall of the particles.
