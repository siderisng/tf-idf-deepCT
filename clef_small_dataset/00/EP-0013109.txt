<ABSTRACT>
a collection appliance (1) for body eliminations or secre­ tions having a novel closure means is disclosed.  said closure  means comprises a semi-rigid strip (23) securely affixed adja­ cent to one of the walls (3) of the collection appliance (1).  the  opening (21) is closed by lap folding the extremity (19) of the  collection appliance (1) upon itself and then tucking the folded  extremity into a gap between said strip (23) and said wall (3).   the novel closure means is particularly well suited for releas­ able closure of the drainage opening of an ostomy collection  appliance.
