<ABSTRACT>
4′-nitrobenzyl-7-phenoxyacetamide-3-hydroxy-­ 3-cephem-4-carboxylate solvates are described, of the follow­ ing formula    wherein n is 1 or 0; and x is ch₃cooh, ch₃ch₂cooh or  ch₃oh when n is i, and x is ch₃cooh, ch₃ch₂cooh or 1/2  ch₂cl₂ when n is o.  the solvates are prepared by contacting 4′-nitrobenzyl  7-phenoxyacetamido-3-hydroxy-3-cephem carboxylate  sulphide or sulphoxide with acetic or propionic acid or  methylene chloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
3-hydroxycephalosporin solvates and process for their production this invention relates to novel cephalosporin solvates. 3-hydroxy-3-cephems and the corresponding sulfoxides have been described as intermediates in the chemical conversion of penicillins to cephalosporins substituted directly at c-3 with halo, alko or other functional groups. tsuji disclosed in u.s. patent 4,079,181 the preparation of 3-hydroxy3-cephems from the penicillin sulfoxide derived bicyclic thiazolineazetidinones [u.s. patent no. 3,705,892]. 3-hydroxy-3-cephems have also been prepared by ozonolysis of the corresponding 3-exo me thy lenecephams and penicillin sulfoxlde derived 3-exomethylenecepham sulfoxides [u.s. patent no. 4,052,387] as described by chauvette in u.s. patent nos. 3,917,587 and 4,060,688. also hatfield recently described the reduction of 3-exomethylenecepham and 3-hyd-oxy cephem sulfoxides to the corresponding sulfides using acetyl bromide as 2 reducing agent. the preparation of 3-halocephems and 3-hydroxycephem 2' hers from 3-hydroxycephems has been disclosed by chauvette in u.s. patent nos. 3,925,372 and 3,917,587 respectively. a clinically significant cephalosporin antibiotic which is prepared from 3-hydroxycephem intermediates is 7- [d- (2-amino-2-phenylacetamido) ]- 3-chloro-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. this invention is directed to crystalline acetic acid, propionic acid, methylene chloride and methanol solvates of 4'-nitrobenzyl 7-phenoxyacetamino 3-hydroxy-3-cephem-4-carboxylate and the corresponding sulfoxide. the discovery of the present solvates allows for facile isolation and purification of 4'-nitrobenzyl 7-phenoxyacetamido 3-hydroxy- 3-cephem- 4- carboxylate and its l-oxide. the present invention is directed to 4'nitrobenzyl 7-phenoxyacetamido-3-hydroxy-3-cephem4-carboxylate solvates of the formula emi2.1 wherein n is 1 or 0; and x is ch3cooh, ch3ch2cooh or ch3oh when n is 1, and x is ch3cooh, ch3ch2cooh or 1/2 ch2c12 when n is 0. the acetic acid solvates, a preferred embodiment of the present invention, contain 1 molar eauivalent of acetic acid for each mole of 3-hydroxycephem. they are prepared simply by adding acetic acid to solutions containing 4'-nitrobenzyl 7-phenoxy acetamido- 3-hydroxy- 3- cephem- 4-carboxylate or its 1 oxide. depending, of course, on the concentration of the 3-hydroxycephem in solution and the particular solvent being used, the acetic acid solvate will crystallize spontaneously or it can be caused to crystallize by using conventional crystallization techniques such as lowering the solution temperature, adding an anti-solvent or seeding with crystals of the desired solvate or by using any combination of these crystallization techniques. the crystalline acetic acid solvates are isolated by filtration. solvents from which the acetic acid solvates of the present invention can be crystallized are generally those organic solvents in which the 3-hydroxycephem (sulfoxide) is soluble. suitable solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, ethylene dichlorie, and 1,1,2trichloroethane; cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; and amazes such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. alternatively the acetic acid solvates can be isolated from acetic acid itself. anti-solvents for crystallizing the present acetic acid solvates from water immiscible solutions are lower aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane or "petroleum ethers". water can be employed advantageously in crystallizing the present acetic acid solvates from water miscible solvents such as dimethylformamide or acetic acid. the solutions from which the present acetic acid solvates are isolated can be reaction mixtures in which the 3-hydroxycephem (sulfoxide) has been
