<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides novel prostaglandin compounds  and processes for the preparation thereof which are prostaglandins  of the e, f, or a series having on the terminal  methylene carbon of the alpha chain a substituent selected  from the group consisting of    wherein r is an alkyl group and r₁₅ is c₁-c₄ alkyl, di-c₁-c₄-alkylamino  and phenyl or phenyl substituted with one or  more substituents selected from the group consisting of  c₁-c₄ alkyl, or, sr, f or c1 wherein r is as previously  defined.  processes for the preparation of these compounds  are described as well as pharmaceutical compositions  containing them.  the compounds have a potential utility in  medicine as for example: hypotensive agents, anti-ulcer  agents and bronchodilators.
