<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for drilling a substantially hori­ zontal borehole through a subterranean mineral bed with a  drilling assembly including a drill shaft 10 connected to a  down-hole motor 12 and drill bit 13.  a deflection device 26 is  positioned between the down-hole motor and the drill bit.  the  deflection device applies a predetermined perpendicular  force to the drill bit causing the borehole to deviate from the  drill shaft axis in the direction of the force.  the method  includes periodically surveying the borehole to determine its  position relative to the top or bottom of the mineral bed, and  rotating the drill shaft through a half turn sequentially to  provide an alternating upward and downward trajectory to  the borehole within the upper and lower boundaries of the  mineral bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus and method for directional ¯ drilling¯ ¯¯ this invention relates to a method and apparatus for drilling generally horizontal boreholes in a subterranean earth formation, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for adjusting the trajectory of such a borehole to maintain same within the upper and lower boundaries of a mineral bed such as a seam of coal. the drilling of long generally horizontal gas drainage holes in coal beds is know. in the art as a method for degasifying a coal bed in advance of mining. the gas drainage holes drilled in this manner are either vented or connected to a vacuum source to remove methane from a coal bed. the greatest problem encountered in drilling these gas relief holes is that of maintaining the bit trajectory within the coal seam such that the resulting holes are actually through the coal seam rather than through an overlying or underlying formation. control of borehole trajectory is also important in exploratory drilling for coal or other minerals. a directional drilling system including a drill shaft, a down-hole fluid motor connected to a rotatable bit, and a deflection means is described in u.s. patent no. 3,260,318. the deflection means described therein is a shaft housing having a slight angle formed therein to divert the drill bit from the axis of the drill shaft. rotation of the drill shaft and housing through part of a turn changes the direction of the borehole relative to the drill shaft. however this apparatus has been found to give poor results in controlling the trajectory of generally horizontal boreholes. viewed from one aspect the present invention provides drilling apparatus comprising a down-hole motor', a rotatable shaft for connecting said motor to a drill bit, a non-rotating housing extending from said motor over said shaft, and a deflection member carried by said housing, said deflection member extending radially beyond said housing at one side thereof sufficiently to apply a deflection force to the wall of a borehole during drilling. in operation the deflection member applies a predetermined radial force to a drill bit, causing the trajectory of the borehole being drilled to be deflected in the direction of the applied force. viewed from another aspect the invention provides a method of drilling a substantially horizontal borehole through a subterranean mineral bed with a drilling apparatus having a down-hole motor which provides rotation to a drill bit, wherein: (a) a deflection member having an outwardly biased wall contacting surface is provided on said drilling apparatus between said motor and drill bit and oriented relative to said borehole; (b) said borehole is extended for a distance into said mineral bed while maintaining the orientation of said deflection member; (c) information regarding the trajectory of said borehole is obtained; and (d) said deflection member is rotated through part of a turn whereby upon resumption of drilling the trajectory of said borehole is modified. an embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example and with
