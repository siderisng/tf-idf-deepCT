<ABSTRACT>
a regulated dc power supply circuit comprises first and  second transformers (t1 and t2), a transistor (q) and trigger  means to periodically cause the transistor to conduct to sup足 ply dc current to the transformers.  on application of such  current, flux builds up in the core of the second transformer  (t2) and a winding (p2) of the second transformer (t2) main足 tains conduction of the transistor (q) until the core saturates,  whereupon the flux reverses and drops in value, the transistor  is switched off and collapse of the field in the first transformer  dumps electrical energy into a rectifer circuit (58, 60) con足 nected to the first transformer (t1) to produce a dc output  voltage.  a zener diode (66) or the like connects the dc output  a voltage to a winding (p3) of the second transformer (t2) to  control the value to which the flux in the core of the trans足 former drops to after saturation, thereby to control the time  taken for saturation when the transistor (q) next conducts,  and therefore the amount of energy dumped into the rectifier  circuit (58, 60), in a sense to stabilize the dc output voltage at a  desired value.
