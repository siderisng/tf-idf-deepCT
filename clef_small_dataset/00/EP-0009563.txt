<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of remelting the surface of a workpiece rotating about an axis of rotation (22) which surface has different distance from the axis of rotation (22), such as the cam (20) of a camshaft in which the surface is relatively relative To a power source (15) along a snakes linear melting web (21) will be melted. In order to achieve a consistent hardness quality above the remelting zipper, the relative speed between the power source (15) and the surface to be curing is controlled that from vertex to vertex of the melting web (21) at least approximately equal distances (A) achieves those. Control of the relative speed can be carried out in game meadow by changing the rotational speed of the piece of the piece at constant oscillating movement of the power source (15) or by changing the frequency of oscillation of the energy source (15) at a constant rotary speed speed of the workpiece. The change in the relative speed can be carried out continuously or gradually.
