<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a process for cooking starchy ma­ terial which comprises mixing the starchy material with wa­ ter, pumping the mixture through one or more preheating  units heated by direct injection of cooker flash vapor, in­ troducing the partially heated mixture into the cooker, in­ jecting high pressure steam into the mixture for final heat­ ing to the desired cooking temperature while maintaining  the pressure sufficiently high in the cooker by restricting  the outlet of the cooker and then flashing the mixture  through one or more flash chambers each of which is  connected to a preheating unit for utilization of the flashed  vapor.  with one stage of preheat, the high pressure steam  requirement is 55%, two stages 38%, and three stages  29%.  the fraction of high pressure steam needed corres­ ponds to a fraction represented by    where n is the  number of preheat vessels or stages used.
