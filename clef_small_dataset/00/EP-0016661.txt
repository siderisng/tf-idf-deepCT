<ABSTRACT>
an optically anisotropic deformable pitch precursor,  which upon appropriate heating forms a material suitable for  the manufacture of carbon fibres, is prepared from a  carbonaceous isotropic pitch.  the latter is treated with an  organic solvent system having a solubility parameter be­ tween 1. 0 and 9. 5, preferably a toluene/heptane mixture.   normally the solvent system is employed in an amount of 5  to 150ml per gram of pitch.  the solvent system contains a  dealkylation catalyst, preferably sncl₄, fecl₃, alcl₃ or bf₃ an  amount of 5. 0 wt. % based on the pitch.  a catalyst-­ solubilizing agent can also be added.  reaction between  catalyst and pitch is effected at a temperature normally  between 30°c and 250°c and for a time, suitable from 1 to 5  hours, sufficient to increase the solvent-insoluble fraction of  the pitch.  thereafter the solvent-insoluble fraction is sepa­ rated as the precursor product.
