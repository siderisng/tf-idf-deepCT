<ABSTRACT>
the concentration of deuterium relative to hydrogen in  a hydrofluorocarbon is increased by contacting the hydro­ fluorocarbon, in the presence of an alkali metal amide, with  an amine having a concentration of deuterium that is grea­ ter than that which provides equilibrium with the hydro­ fluorocarbon.  in a preferred embodiment, a compound  enriched in deuterium is produced by first exposing tri­ fluoromethane to infrared laser radiation to selectively  cause a chemical reaction involving deuterium-containing  molecules.  the deuterium-depleted trlfluoromethane is  deuterium replenished by exchange with an amine, and the  compound enriched in deuterium is converted to heavy  water.  heavy water is useful in certain types of nuclear  reactors.

<DESCRIPTION>
description process for deuterium exchange between hydrofluorocarbons and amines background of the invention 1. field of the invention. this invention relates to chemical exchange between hydrogenous compounds, in particular to deuterium exchange between hydrofluorocarbons and amines. 2. description of the prior art. as used in this specification and the appended claims, terms such as "hydrogen," "water" and "hydrofluorocarbons" designate materials which include the naturally occurring abundance of deuterium, which is generally in the range from about 0.010 to about 0.016 mole percent relative to the hydrogen content. substantially pure (isotopically) materials are referred to in symbolic form; e.g. h2o and d2o. the term "deuterium-enriched" means material whose deuterium concentration has been increased by an exchange process to a level greater than that before the exchange, regardless of whether or not the enriched material has a deuterium concentration greater than the natural abundance. conversely, "deuterium-depleted" material has had its deuterium concentration reduced by an exchange process or other process to a concentration which may or may not be lower than the natural abundance. also, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the term '1chemical reaction is meant to include unimolecular reactions, such as isomerization, dissociation and predissociation, in addition to more conventional chemical reactions. heavy water (d2o) finds important use as a neutron moderator and coolant in certain atomic power reactors. these reactors are typified by the candu (canadian deuterium-uranium) reactor. they have the important advantage that they do not require the use of 235 uranium enriched in u as a fuel; instead, they use lower-cost natural uranium. they do, however, require large quantities of heavy water. typically, 850 kg of d2o are required per hw of installed electrical capacity. the d2o cost constitutes about 15% of the capital costs for the power plant. with growing worldwide interest in heavy water reactors, some estimates project d2or requirements for the atomic power industry to reach 9000 mg per year by the turn of the century. accordingly, low cost schemes for producing d2o are required. at present, large-scale production of heavy water is based on the girdler sulfide (gs) process, which involves an isotopic exchange process between hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and water. the overall exchange mechanism can be described by the dual temperature reaction: 300c hds(g) + h20(l) + h2s(g) + hdo(1). 1300c using this technology, an enrichment factor, b, defined as the ratio of the concentration of deuterium in the product to its concentration in the feed material, an effective value of 1.3 is obtained in a single elemental stage of enrichment. after multiple enrichment stages, the final deuterium content in the water using this exchange technique is on the order of 20%. further deuterium enrichment to the required 99.75 atom percent d is conveniently done by water distillation. the requirement of hundreds of separative elements, coupled with the low d/h ratio in natural -4 water (¯1.5 x 10 ), make it necessary to process nearly 40 000 moles of feed material for each mole of product. this makes gs

i claim:    1. a process for obtaining compounds enriched in a desired isotope of an element selected from hydrogen and carbon characterized in that subatmospheric pressure gaseous trifluoromethane containing said desired isotope and one or more other isotopes of the same element is exposed to infrared laser radiation of a predetermined frequency, which selectively dissociates trifluoromethane molecules containing said desired isotope of said element without substantially dissociating trifluoromethane molecules containing other isotopes of said element, thereby producing a dissociation product enriched in said desired isotope, and separating the resulting dissociation product enriched in said desired isotope from the remainder of the gas.    2. the process of claim 1, wherein said desired isotope is an isotope of the group consisting of hydrogen, deuterium and an isotope of carbon.    3. the process of claim 1 wherein said predetermined frequency is selected from frequencies of 975 + 50   cm ,    2150 + 100   cm 1,    and 2405 + 100   cm     4. a process for increasing the concentration of deuterium relative to hydrogen in a hydrofluorocarbon, which comprises contacting the hydrofluorocarbon in the presence of an alkali metal amide with an amine having a concentration of deuterium at least that which will yield an increase in deuterium concentration of the hydrofluorocarbon upon equilibration.    5. the process of claim 4 wherein the hydrofluorocarbon is of the formula hcf2x, wherein x is f, cf3, chf2, ch2f or ch3.    6. the process of claim 4 wherein the amine is selected from the group consisting of ammonia, aliphatic amines and alicyclic amines.    7. a process for obtaining a compound enriched in deuterium in which a gaseous hydrofluorocarbon is exposed to infrared laser radiation of a predetermined frequency to selectively cause a chemical reaction  involving hydrofluorocarbon molecules containing deuterium without substantially affecting hydrofluorocarbon molecules not containing deuterium, thereby producing, as reaction products, a compound enriched in deuterium and hydrofluorocarbon depleted in deuterium characterized in that the deuterium content of the depleted hydrofluorocarbon is enriched by contacting the depleted hydrofluorocarbon with an alkali metal amide and an amine having a concentration of deuterium at least that which will yield an increase in deuterium concentration of the hydrofluorocarbon upon equilibration, whereby the amine becomes depleted in deuterium.     8. the process of claim 7 further characterized in that the deuterium content of the depleted amine is replenished by contacting the depleted amine with a deuterium source selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and water, whereby the deuterium source becomes depleted in deuterium.    9. the process of claim 8 wherein the amine is an aliphatic or alicyclic amine.    10. the process of claim 8 wherein the deuterium source contacting the depleted amine is hydroqen and wherein the deuterium content of the depleted hydrogen is replenished by contacting the depleted hydrogen with water.
