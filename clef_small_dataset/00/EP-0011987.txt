the surface of stainless steel belt used for casting plastics  sheet is improved by first grinding the back surface of the belt  until no further distortions can be removed and then grinding  the mirrored surface of the belt until the mirrored surface is  uniformly dull and then polishing the dulled surface to a  mirrored finish.  during the grinding and polishing, the belt is  cooled to avoid local overheating.
