<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula:    wherein   r is c₁-c₄ alkyl, no₂, cl, br, so₂nr₁r₂ where r₁ and r₂  are selected from c₁-c₃ alkyl;   x is h, cl, br, ch₃, ch₃ch₂, alkoxy c₁-c₃, cf₃, ch₃s or  ch₃och₂;   y is ch₃ or ch₃o; and   z is ch or n;   and agriculturally suitable salts thereof, exhibit herbicidal  activity especially against broadleaf weeds; they are selec­ tive in certain crops, e. g.  wheat and barley.  the compounds  can be formulated for use in conventional manner.  they may  be made by reacting an appropriately substituted 2-­ aminotriazine or 2-aminopyrimidine with a substituted  thiophenenesulfonyl isocyanate.

<DESCRIPTION>
herbicidal thiophenesulfonamides, and preparation, compositions and use thereof this invention relates to thiophenesulfonamides and their use as agricultural chemicals and particularly as herbicides. u.s. patent 4,127,405 teaches compounds which are useful for controlling weeds in wheat having the emi1.1 wherein r1 is emi1.2 r3 and r6 are independently hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1-4 carbon atoms, nitro, tri- flourometyl,cyano,ch3s(o)n- or ch3ch2s(o)n-; r4 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or methyl; r is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl or methoxy; r7 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, alkyl of 1-2 carbon atoms or alkoxy of 1-2 carbon atoms; r8 is hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or bromine; r9 and r10 are independently hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or bromine; ; w and q are independently oxygen or sulfur; n is 0, 1 or 2; x is hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, methyl, ethyl, alkoxy of 1-3 carbon atoms, trifluorometyl, ch3s- or ch3och2-; and z is methyl or methoxy; or their agriculturally suitable salts; provided that: (a) when r5 is other than hydrogen, at least one of r3,r4,r6 and r7 is other than hydrogen and at least two of r3, r4, r6 and r7 must be hydrogen; (b) when r5 is hydrogen and all of r3, r4 r6 and r7 are other than hydrogen, then all of r3, r4, r6 and r7 must be either chlorine or methyl; and (c) when r3 and r7 are both hydrogen, at least one of r4, r5 or r6 must be hydrogen. french patent no. 1,468,747 discloses the following para-subsxituted phenysullfonamides, useful as antidiabetic agents: emi2.1 wherein r = ij, halogen, cf3 or alkyl. logemann et al. chem. ab., 53, 18052 g (1959), disclose a number of sulfonamides, including uracil derivatives and those having the formula: emi3.1 wherein r is butyl, phenyl or emi3.2 and r1 is hydrogen.or methyl. when tested for hypoglycemic effect in rats (oral doses of 25 mg/100 g), the compounds in which r is butyl and phenyl were most potent. the others were of low potency or inactive. wojciechowski, j. acta. polon. charm. 19, p. 121-5 (1962) schem ab., 59 1533 e] describes the synthesis of n-[(2,6-dimethoxypypirimidin-4-yl) aminocarbonyl]-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide: emi3.3 based upon similarity to a known compound, the author predicted hypoglycemic activity for the foregoing compound. netherlands patent 121,788, published september 15, 1966, teaches the preparation of compounds of formula (i), and their use as general or selective herbicides, emi4.1 wherein r1 and rz may independently be alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms; and r3 and r4 may independently be hydrogen, chlorine or alkyl of 1-4 carbon atoms. compounds of formula (it), and their use as antidiabetic agents, are reported in j. drug. res. 5, 123 (1974), emi4.2 wherein r is pyridyl. the presence o undesired vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops, especially agri- cultural products that satisfy man's basic food needs, such as barley, wheat, and the like. the current population explosion and concomitant world food shortage demand improvements in the efficiency of producing these crops. prevention or minimizing the loss of a
