<ABSTRACT>
nonwoven fabrics are disclosed which comprise fibers,  at least 50% by weight of which are hydrophobic fibers such  as polyester or polypropylene, and a binder comprising an  emulsion copolymer.  the copolymer comprises (a) 1 to 8% by  weight of at least one monoethylenically unsaturated carbox­ ylic acid, such as acrylic of methacrylic acid, (b) 50 to 75% by  weight of at least one c₄ to c₈ alkyl acrylate, particularly butyl  acrylate and (c) 20 to 49% by weight of at least one of methyl  methacrylate, styrene and α-methyl styrene.  the fabric has  sufficient wet-strength for use as diaper coverstock and bin­ ders free of formaldehyde and acrylonitrile units are free of  the hazardous effects of these materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
nonwoven fabrics and their preparation this invention is concerned with bonded non-woven fibrous or filamentous products. the products preferably have a carded fiber structure, or comprise fibrous mats in which the fibers or filaments are distributed haphazardly or in random array. the invention also relates to methods for producing the bonded non-woven fibrous products of shaped articles therefrom. the bonded non-woven fibrous products are useful in the production of articles of either flat or three-dimensional shape, including diaper coverstock and the like, as will be described more particularly hereinafter. as part of the increasing attention being given to health and environmental problems, greater attention is being paid to the components of sanitary and health care fabric products such as diapers, sanitary napkins, hospital drapes, disposable sheets and bed pads. nonwoven fabrics for these applications are required to have an adequate tensile strength and abrasion resistance when wet by water or aqueous systems such as body fluids (urine, perspiration, etc.). generally the binders in current use for nonwoven webs are crosslinked in order to obtain an adequate level of strength and abrasion resistance of the water-wet fabric. the crosslinking is normally based on formaldehyde, usually in the form of methylolated acrylamide although aminoplast crosslinkers are also used. such systems are described by kine et al in u.s. patent 3,157,562 and by kine and matlin in u.s. patent 2,931,749. formaldehyde is known to be a skin irritant, there is recent evidence that it is mutagenic (kaplan, w.d. in science vol. 108, p 43, 1948) and concern has also been expressed that it may be found to be carcinogenic. for similar reasons, other relatively hazardous components, such as acrylamide and acrylonitrile, are also to be avoided in the manufacture of polymers for use as binders for nonwoven fabrics in the sanitary and health products area. non-crosslinking systems have been taught as binders for non-woven fabrics for certain specialty applications. in united states patent 3,554,788, fechillas teaches a water-sensitive disposable, i.e., dispersible in water and flushable in home water closets, fabric for similar sanitary and health product uses. fechillas' binder comprises from about 70 to 90% of a water insoluble, substantially water insensitive, film-forming, non-selfcrosslinking polymer and about 10 to 30% of a water soluble polymer. the water soluble polymers are described as water sensitive binders such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, the natural gums such as guar and preferably the alginates, such as sodium alginate, having pseudo-plastic flow properties. in u.s. patent 3,616,166, l. e. kelley teaches a non-woven fabric bonded by a blend of a linear polymer of ethyl acrylate having a minimum film temperature not above room temperature and a viscosity average molecular weight of about 150,000 to 300,000 and a hard polymer having a minimum filming temperature of at least about crosslinked and is preferably linear, the fibrous product or fabric has wet-strength when dried and cured, even when these steps are carried out at comparatively low temperatures, including temperatures below 1100c. the drying and curing steps produce the necessary
