<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for moving an object which is floatable on  a cushion of gas from a first station to a second station.  a  porous table (10) over which the object (30) is moved is  divided into a plurality of zones of gas flow.  contiguous gas zones can have the same amount of  gas flowing therethrough thereby to define areas of gas  flow (1/2)-(5), (7), (8).  the areas of gas flow are never larger than the object  being moved thereover.  the areas of gas flow (1/2)-(5),  (7), (8) have different amounts of gas flow with the largest  accuring at the first station (20) and the lowest at the  second station (40).  when an object (30) is placed at the  first station (20), it is supported on areas having two different  amounts of gas flow.  this causes the object to tip  front end downwardly in the area of lowest gas flow and  thereby be moved the porous table member (10) eventually  to the second station (40).
