<ABSTRACT>
a fuel injection pump assembly includes a single fuel  metering valve (60) of the sleeve type cooperating through  spill ports (74) with the output of a number of coaxially  mounted pump plungers (46) and an equal number of fuel  delivery valves (82), the plungers being moved axially by an  engine driven pump (34) that is drive connected by splines  (99) and pin (108) and slot (110) type connections to a centrifugal  fuel injection timing advance means (112) and to the  metering valve (60) permitting the valve to move angularly  and axially relative to the pump to provide changes in timing  and rate of injection, and a manually operated lever (180) to  axially move the metering valve (60) at will to change the fuel  flow rate without influence of fuel pressure forces on the valve  end and without the necessity of also moving the mass of the  first means (112) that changes the injection timing.
