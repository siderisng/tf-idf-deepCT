<ABSTRACT>
apparatus (10) for housing a shaft coupling (26), comprisÂ­ ing an outside axially extending sleeve (28) for connection to a  first shaft casing (16), and for partially convering a pair of  generally aligned shafts (12, 14) and a shaft coupling (26)  connecting shafts (12, 14); and an inside axially extending  sleeve (3) for connection to a second shaft casing (56), and  for further covering the shafts (12, 14) and the shaft coupling  (26), wherein the inside sleeve (30) is radially spaced from the  outside sleeve (28) and is axially slidable into the interior of  the outside sleeve (28) to produce an annular opening for  access to the shaft (12, 14) and shaft coupling (26).  the  apparatus (10) further comprises radial sealing means (40) for  sealing the space between the inside (30) and outside sleeves  (28).
