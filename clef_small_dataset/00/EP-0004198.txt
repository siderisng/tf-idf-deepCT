<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus dispenses flowable particulate materials  from a storage container while isolating the material from  unnecessary exposure to ambient atmosphere.  for this purpose  the apparatus includes a funnel element (58) mounted  to receive particulate material from the container.  a metering  member (60) and a closure (62) are mounted on a common  reciprocable rod (134) to provide double isolation of the material  from the ambient atmosphere.  the metering member  portion is adjustable in relation to the funnel element.  particulate  material is dispensed when the reciprocable rod is  manually moved downwardly a distance sufficient to open  the closure.  after dispensing the particulate material an  activable element (214) is operated to return the bell from its  sealing relation, with the funnel element to the same, or new  adjusted position, relative to the funnel element.
