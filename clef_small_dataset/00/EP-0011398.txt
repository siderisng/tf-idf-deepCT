<ABSTRACT>
a nutating drive includes an outer rotatable structure  (38,40) rotatable about an axis (16) and having a generally  cylindrical cavity (18) therein, an axis (20) of the cavity (18)  being inclined to the axis of rotation (16) of the rotatable  structure (38,40).  a generally cylindrical nutatable member  (22) is mounted within the cavity (18) and a generally conical  surface of a complementary member (26,32) is in driving  contact with a generally cylindrical surface (28) of the nutat­ able member (22).  the complementary member (26,32) has  an output shaft (30) generally coaxial with the axis (16) of the  rotatable structure (38,40).  the nutatable member (22) is con­ stained against rotation while nutating upon rotation of the  rotatable structure (38,40) by means of a number of balls  (60,66) which are partly located in slots (56,58,62,64) in statio­ nary structure (12) and in the nutatable member (22).
