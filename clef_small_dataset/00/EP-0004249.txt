<ABSTRACT>
Coupling coaxial and return hoses for hydraulic devices and machines such as secators and hydraulic construction equipment comprising: the body (1) of said apparatus in which a bore (2) communicating with the return of the fluid is provided. at low pressure and in the bottom of which is provided an axial drilling (3) for the arrival of the high pressure fluid, and a tip consisting of coaxial connections (6 and 8), respectively, at the end of the inner hose feed (7) and at the end of the return exterior hose (9). To prevent the torsion of the coaxial hoses and allow their coupling or rapid coupling, said tip (6, 8) is mounted with freedom of rotation relative to said drilling (3) and the boring (2) of the body (1) in which it is mounted, while a bearing (13) is mounted on the outer fitting (8) and disposed between said connector and the lateral wall of said bore (2); A removable stop (17) ensuring the permanence of the rotary coupling.
