<ABSTRACT>
new compounds are described that fall within the  general formula i    wherein r¹ is hydrogen or a methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy,  butoxy, tetrafluoroethoxy, methylthio, ethylthio, propylthio,  fluoro, chloro, bromo, methyl, ethyl, or nitro group, and r² is  hydrogen or a methyl group, or r¹ and r² together form a  methylenedioxy group; and r³ is hydrogen, or halogen or an  esterifying group, as well as other derivatives of the acid.  the  esterifying group may be a lower alkyl group, or one of the  following groups (a) to (f):-   (a) 3-phenoxybenzyl   (b) 2-benzyl-4-furylmethyl   (c) α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl   (d) 3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl   (e) α-ethynyl-3-phenoxybenzyl   (f) α-cyano-3-(4′-chlorophenoxyl)-benzyl   and y¹, y², y³, y⁴, y⁵ and y⁶ are the same or different groups  and each is hydrogen or a fluoro, bromo or chloro group,  with the proviso that when r¹ is fluoro, chloro, bromo or  methyl and r² is hydrogen, then one of y¹ to y⁶ is other than  hydrogen.  processes of making the compounds are described.   the compounds in which r³ is one of groups (a) to  (f) are insecticides and insecticidal methods and compositions  containing them are described.
