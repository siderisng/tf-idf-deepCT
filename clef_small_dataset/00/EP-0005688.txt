<ABSTRACT>
a selvage forming device is provided with cooperating  thread distributing elements (10, 14, 16) which perform  relative vertical movements to each other over prescribed  distances while utilizing shedding motion of harnesses for  plain weave only in order to distribute at least one leno warp  (ty1, ty2) for one course of leno weave alternately on  different lateral sides of each ground warp (gy) controlled by  a guide needle (10), once for each pick, by means of sliding  contact of their slant edges with the leno warp, thereby  forming stout leno selvages for woven cloths with simplified  construction and movements of the related mechanical  elements.
