<ABSTRACT>
in the method of producing koji for use in making soy  sauce wherein a koji culture is grown on a koji mixture con­ taining soy beans and cereal grain, an improvement is pro­ vided comprising providing a koji mixture with 18% to 40%  moisture; inoculating the mixture with koji culture; forming a  bed (3) of the mixture to a depth (d) of 20 to 127 cm.  in a  receptacle (1) having a perforated bottom (2) airflow means  (9) communicating with the perforated bottom (2) for forcing  room air (10) through the bottom (2) and through the recepta­ cle (1), temperature sensing means (4) in the bed (3) and  actuating means (5) for actuating the airflow means (9) in  response to the temperature sensing means (4); controlling  the room air between 5°c and 38°c and the relative humidity  above at least 50 %; controlling the temperature of the bed (3)  within the range of 15°c to 42°c by actuating the airflow  means (9) in response to the temperature sensing means (4)  whereby room air (10) is flowed through the bed (3); and  continuing the growth of koji culture in the bed (3) for 2 to 10  days without disturbing the bed (3).
