<ABSTRACT>
a method of non-destructive testing wherein ultrasonic  signals from a transducer are converted into television wave  form and stored on video recording magnetic tape for  reproduction as required.  because the signals are recorded  live rather than in the form of a cathode ray oscilloscope  display they can be rectified as necessary.  positional co­ ordinates of the transducer may be stored so that b-scans at  varying thresholds can be reproduced.  position and ultraso­ nic signals are interleaved on the video recording magnetic  tape.  apparatus for performing the method includes a video  recording device having a rotatable head and interface units  for converting the radio frequency signals into television  wave form and for decoding the signals for reproduction.
