<ABSTRACT>
Locking circuit with fully integrated adjustment and reset possibility, with two bistable transistors (58, 59), a third transex stor (56) controllable via a data input line (42) and thus connected in series, via a clock pulse line (27) Contrastable fourth transistor (54) in which circuit a binary data signal can be adjusted to the bistable circuit at its outputs (q, q) to the corresponding binary output signal upon occurrence of a clock pulse and with a five th transistor (80) to the series connection of the third and fourth transistors (56, 54) are connected in parallel, connected to one of the two transistors (58, 59) of the bistable circuit and controllable via an input terminal (79) with an adjustment signal, and with a sixth transistor (82) connected to the other which is connected to the transistors (58, 59) and to the rows circuit of the fourth transistor Ors (54) connected in parallel with a seventh transistor (57) controllable by a reference potential and can be controlled at an input terminal (81) with a return signal, so that the Bi stable circuit (10 ') independent of clock pulses by the adjustment or Return signals in their corresponding operating state is switchable.
