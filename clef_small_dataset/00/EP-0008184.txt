<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides derivatives of c-076, which is  a series of macrolides, having certain hydrocarbon substit­ uents.  the hydrocarbon substituents in general are alkyl  groups which may be straight or branched and may option­ ally be substituted with phenyl.  the substituted c-076 com­ pounds are prepared by various procedures depending  upon the position of the reaction site, and the particular  c-076 compound being substituted.  the compounds thus  produced are of formula:    where the broken line indicates that a single or a double  bond is present in the 22(23) position; r₁ is hydroxy, lower­ alkanoyloxy or hydrocarbonoxy and is present only when  the broken line indicates a single bond; r₂ is iso-propyl  or sec-butyl; r₃ is hydrogen, methyl, loweralkanoyl or a  hydrocarbon;   r is hydrogen, loweralkanoyl, a hydrocarbon,    where r₄ is hydrogen, loweralkanoyl or a hydrocarbon, and   r₅ is hydrogen or methyl; and the said hydrocarbonoxy  group of r₁ is an alkoxy of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or  an alkoxy of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an alkoxy of  from 1 to 10 carbon atoms substituted by phenyl and the  said hydrocarbon groups of r and r₄, which are the same  or different, are alkyl of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or alkyl  of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms substituted by phenyl; and  the said hydrocarbon group of r₃ is an alkyl of from 2 to  10 carbon atoms or an alkyl of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms  substituted by phenyl; provided that at least one of the r,  r₁, r₃, and r₄ groups is or contains a hydrocarbon group  or r₅ is methyl.  they have profound anthelmintic, insecti­ cidal, ectoparasiticidal and acaracidal activity and composi­ tions for such uses are also disclosed.
