<ABSTRACT>
In a charge carrier beam tool machine, such as an electron beam welding machine, the position of the stain, where the charge carrier beam (14) occurs during the processing of a workpiece assembly (10) on the surface, is regulated by the axis (30) of a beam supply system supplying the beam. that the beam is deflected during a short, the machining operation of interrupting measuring periods along a closed measuring path (22), which crosses a zone (12) to be machined (12) of the workpiece assembly (10) in machining or feed direction (x) prior to the current processing area (12) which is detected in the beam expression stain emerging X-ray radiation by an X-ray sensor arrangement which has at least one sharp measuring range limit (28a, 150) which extends at a distance from the machining area (18) and cuts the measuring path (22), and an adjusting signal for a feed direction (x) and / or a transverse (y) too This acting actuator depending on the amount of the measuring path determined by the X-ray sensor arrangement between a measuring path reference position (18) and the location (40), where the measuring path cuts the measuring range limit is generated. To increase the measurement accuracy, the beam cross section during the measuring periods can be changed by a charge carrier optical device, such as a stigmator or an auxiliary focusing lens relative to the beam cross section used during the machining operation.
