<ABSTRACT>
In the process for energy recovery in the production of high-pressure polyethylene made of ethylene gas, the ethylene gas is compressed and partially converted in a reactor (R) by polymerization in polyethylene.For energy recovery, the polymer gas mixture (M) emerging from the reap door (R) can not be supplied directly to a turbine due to nes high pressure and the portion of pasty polyethy len.Therefore, it is accelerated in a nozzle system (30) and tensioned, mixed with a quasi polymer-free working current (M ') and compacted, whereupon the polymer-free gasmens Ge (M') in and after a separator (A) is separated, a relaxation turbine (t) flows through, then combined in the nozzle system (30) of (e) with the coming from the reactor (R) polymer gas mixture (M) and the gas stream (M ') coming from the relaxation turbine (T) continuously in the energyReplacing unit (E) is recompressed.
