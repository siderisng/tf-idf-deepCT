<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector (40) comprising a connector ele­ ment (1) having mounting means projecting in a plane per­ pendicular to the direction of mating of the connector element  with a complementary connector element and a mounting  device.  the mounting device comprises an l-shaped body  portion having a slot extending from the free end of one of the  limbs of the l towards the junction of the two limbs of the l.   the connector element is assembled in the slot and retained  in position by a planar member (10) having an aperture  through which a portion of the connector projects.  this  enables the connector element to be assembled in the body  portion with pre-formed connection leads projecting through  apertures in the other limb of the body portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
"electrical connector" the invention relates to an electrical connector comprising a connector element having mounting means projecting in a plane perpendicular to the direction of mating of the connector element with a complementary connector element and 4 mounting device for mounting the connector element with the plane of the mounting means perpendicular to a surface on which it is to be mounted, the mount ing device comprising an l-shaped body portion. electrical connector elements, that is plugs and sockets, have been mounted on surfaces by means of shaped mounting embers provided with an aperture in the limb perpendicular to the surface. the plug or socket projects through the aperture and is coupled to the perpendicular limb by any convenient fastening device, for example rivets or nuts and bolts. this construction is simple and convenient provided that the leads from the connector are flexible or are not arranged to pass through the other limb of the l. however, if such a connector is to be mounted on a printed circuit board it is convenient to pass the connecting leads from the connector element through the other limb of the l and through corresponding holes in the printed circuit board so that the connections may be flow soldered to the conductors on the printed circuit board. it weald be convenient for assembly if the connecting leads were rigid and pre-formed to pass through the apertures in the other limb of the l. this would, however, require that the connector element be inserted into the mounting device in a direction which is perpendicular to both limbs of the l. this is clearly impossible and hence simple apertures in both limbs of the l are nft satisfactory. it is an object of the invention to provide an electrical connector comprising 2 connector element and a mounting device comprising an shaped body portion in which the connector element may be assembled on the body portion by movement in a direction parallel to the limb of the l on which it is located. the invention provides an electrical connector comprising a connector element having mounting means projecting in a plane perpendicllar to the direction of mating of the connector element with a complementary connector element and a mounting device for mounting the connector element with the plane of the mounting means perpendicular to a surface on which it is to be mounted, the mounting device comprising an shaped body portion characterised in that the body portion has a slot in which the connector element is located, the slot extending from the free end of one limb of the l towards the junction of the two limbs of the l and the mounting device further comprises a planar member having an aperture through which the connector element projects, the planar member being arranged to cover the one limb and being coupled thereto to retain the connector element within the slot. by forming a slot rather than an aperture in the limb the connector may be assembled by
