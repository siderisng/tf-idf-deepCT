<ABSTRACT>
a method of heat treating a slurry material which has  combustible and incombustible components includes burnÂ­ ing the material in a fluidised bed, to devolatilise the water  content and to produce a material which cannot be reslimed.   fine material elutriated from the bed is separated from the  entraining gases and is recycled to the centre axis of the bed  such that upon rising through the bed they encounter and  are doused by the incoming spray of slurry material, the fine  material so introduced is at a temperature lower than that of  the fluidised bed and thus can be used to control the bed  temperature by varying the amount of fine material recycled.
