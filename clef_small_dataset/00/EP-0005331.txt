<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for transporting magnetically susceptically  particles such as ferrous powders, comprises means defining  a path (7) and an electric linear thrust device (1) associated  with the path so that, when the device is energised,  the particulate material passes along the path.  the apparatus  can be used to separate magnetically suscepting  powder from non-magnetically suscepting powder.  a mixture  of the two powders is placed at one end of the path  and only the magnetically suscepting powder is transported  along the path.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for transporting particles of magnetically suscepting material. rhis invention relates to apparatus for transporting particles of magnetically suscepting material along a path. in the manufacture and use of particles of magnetically suscepting material it is sometimes necessary to transport the material from one position to another, as for example from the place of manufacture to a storage bin, or from a storage bin to a place where the particles are used. it is an object of the invention to provide apparatus for readily transporting such materials. according to the present invention, apparatus for transporting particles of magnetically suscepting material comprises means providing a path for the particles to be transported and at least one electric linear thrust device associated with the path and arranged, when energised, to displace the particles along aid path. the means providing- the path is conveniently in the form of a channel with the base of the channel constituted by a flat surface which may be a flat surface of the linear thrust device or a plate positioned close to the flat surface of the linear thrust device. the plate may be of magnetically inert material such as a plastics material, e.g. polycarbonate. the atmosphere around the path will usually be air but it may contain an atmosphere of other gaseous material, for example, a non-oxidising gas. alternatively, the path may be filled with a liquid and the particles are caused to move through the liquid and along the path. examples of magnetically suscepting materials which can be transported are ferrous powder, low alloy steel powder, powders of cobalt containing alloys, and powders of other magnetic alloys. the apparatus can be used to separate particles of magnetically suscepting materials from a mixture of magnetically suscepting particles and non-magnetically suscepting particles. for example, during the manufacture of high speed steel powder by an atomisation process, the powder so formed is contaminated by particles of refractory material from the atomising vessel. the apparatus may be used to separate the particles of high speed steel from the particles of refractory contaminant. another example is the use of the apparatus to separate grinding swarf from particles removed from a grinding wheel during a grinding operation. when a magnetically suscepting material is ground on a grinding wheel, the swarf of the magnetically suscepting material which is produced could be re-used to advantage but it contains particles removed from the grinding wheel. since the grinding wheel particles are of a non-magnetically suscepting material, the apparatus of the present invention can be used to separate these particles from those of the grinding swarf. in order that the invention may be more readily understood it will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view of powder transporting apparatus in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, figure 2 is a section on the line a-a of figure 1, and figure 3 is a side elevation, partly in section
