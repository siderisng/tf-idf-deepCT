<ABSTRACT>
a box frame comprises four extruded lengths 10.   across the front of the frame is a translucent backing panel  14.  a transparent front panel 18 sandwiches a poster 16  against the backing panel 14, and is normally held in this  condition by a peripheral mouldlng 20.  to change the  poster, the moulding is hinged about hinges 28 away from  the frame 10, the front panel 18 being retained to the  moulding by clips 40 slidable in a channel 36.  the panel 18  is held firm in the clips 40 by a resilient sealing strip 48.  the  backing panel 14 is similarly retained to the frame 10 by  further clips 40, which are also used to hold the poster 16.   this facilitates changing the poster and obviates the neces­ sity to use adhesive tape to hold the poster.

<DESCRIPTION>
poster display device this invention relates to display devices, and more particularly to devices for displaying posters and the like. posters and the like are nowadays frequently displayed in a box-like frame, behind a transparent front panel, usually of an acrylic plastics material. the poster is sandwiched between the transparent panel and a backing panel on the front of the frame, and the transparent panel is retained to the frame by a moulding around its periphery. it will be understood that in practice this "moulding" is not usually moulded in fact, but rather is fabricated or extruded e.g. from metal. it is possible for the backing panel to be translucent, so that lights can be mounted within the frame to illuminate the poster. to change the poster, it is necessary to remove the peripheral moulding, followed by the transparent front panel, and then the existing poster. a new poster is then sandwiched between the front panel and the backing panel, while the moulding is replaced. this is a rather difficult manipulation, and accordingly the. poster is commonly attached to the backing panel, for example by adhesive tape, before replacement of the front panel. even so, the operation is rather difficult, especially if the frame is mounted high up on a wall or on a post, so that it is necessary to use a ladder to work on it. for example, it is necessary to take the moulding down the ladder before removing the front panel, and there is then a danger of the front panel falling down before it can be removed. a further difficulty with these known display devices is that provision is not made to weatherproof the frame, and in particular to prevent the ingress of moisture. such moisture then causes the deterioration of the poster, or it may become detached from the backing sheet and creep downwards between the front and backing panels under gravity. the ingress of moisture is also dangerous in an illuminated display device. according to the present invention, there is provided a display device comprising a frame, a backing panel across the front of the frame, a transparent front panel for fitting over the backing panel to sandwich a poster or the like between them, and a peripheral moulding around the front panel which is securable to the frame to hold the front panel against the backing panel, characterised in that the front panel is retained in the moulding on removal of the latter away from the frame. preferably, the moulding is hinged to the frame. preferably the front panel is retained to the moulding by means of a clip which is attachable to the moulding and which has a depending portion passing over the edge of the front panel. the clip may be u-shaped with one arm having means for attachment to the moulding, and the other, free arm providing the depending portion. preferably more than one clip is used, and preferably the clips are slidably attached to the moulding, so that

claims:   1. a display device comprising a frame   (10;12),    a backing panel (14) across the front of lhe frame, a transparent front panel (18) for fitting over the backing panel to sandwich a poster or the like (16) between them, and a peripheral moulding (20) around the front panel which is securable to the frame to hold the front panel against the backing panel, characterised in that the front panel is retained in the moulding on removal of the latter away from the frame.   2. a display   device¯according    to claim 1 wherein the moulding (20) is hinged (28) to the frame    (leo;12).      3. a display device according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the front panel (18) is retained to the moulding (20) by a clip (40) which is attachable to the moulding and which has a depending portion (41) passing over the edge of the front panel.   4. a display device according to claim 3 wherein the clip (40) is u-shaped with one arm having means (42) for attachment to the moulding, and the other, free arm providing the depending portion (41).   5. a display device according to claim 3 or claim 4 wherein more than one clip (40) is used, and the clips are slidably attached to the moulding, so that the positions of the clips can be adjusted to support the front panel.   6. a display device according to any one of claims 3, 4 and 5 wherein the backing panel (14) is retained to the frame   (10;12)    by one or more clips (40) similar to that  used to retain the front panel (18) to the moulding (20).    7. a display device according to claim 6 wherein there is a resilient member (48) between the backing panel (14) and the frame (10;12), which urges the backing panel against the depending portion(s) (41) of its clip or clips (40).   8. a display device according to any one of claims 3 to 7 wherein there is a resilient member (48) between the front panel (18) and the moulding (20), which urges the backing panel against the depending arm(s) (41) of its clip or clips (40).   9. a display device according to claim 7 or claim 8 wherein the or either resilient member (48) also acts as a seal to prevent the ingress of moisture.   10. a display device according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the backing panel (14) is translucent and lights are provided within the frame in order to illuminate the poster or the like (16).
