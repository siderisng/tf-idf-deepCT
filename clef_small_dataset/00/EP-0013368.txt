<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for controlling the voltage of a web (1) with a dancer roller (3) about which the web (1) is guided, with which a pivotally mounted lever (4) is connected, its decay is described. a pneumatic valve (10 or 11) affected, which in a dross (14 or 15) provided pressure line system, the pneumatic pressure of a brake cylinder (22) of a pneumatic brake of a machine-machining machine maps, wherein on the lever (4) a tension spring (6) with adjusting ba SEM spring cable engages and that the lever is pivotable between two end switches (10.11), which in each case a pneumatic line (12, 13) switched on valves (10, 11) connected in series-connected throttles (14 , 15), which are both connected to a compressed air tank (19) which acts on the brake cylinder (22), which acted in a verrin give the voltage of the web (1) VE n Til (10) in the pressurized line (12) is turned on and at its actuation by the lever (4) the pressure air tank (19) connects to the compressed air source (15) and that when enlargement of the voltage of the web (1 ) Provided valve (11) is turned on into a cable (13) in the atmosphere and the compressed air tank (19) connects to the atmosphere when actuating.
