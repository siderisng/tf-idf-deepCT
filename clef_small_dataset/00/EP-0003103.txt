<ABSTRACT>
this invention concerns down-the-hole drilling, where  there is a persistent problem in providing an adequately  controlled flow of flushing fluid to the face of the drill bit.  in  known down-the-hole drills turbulence and closed circuits of  the flushing fluid tend to erode the bit and reduce its lifespan.   the invention seeks to lessen these drawbacks by providing  for the flow of flushing fluid to be divided into a component  directed along a first cavity (22, 24) which terminates at the  face (18) of the bit and another component directed along a  second cavity (28, 30) which terminates above the face and is  deflected up the drill hole.  weakening of the bit is avoided if  there is at most one bore through the bit for flushing fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
dc^.r.- otv d?ttxing this invention relates to down-the-hole drilling and provides improvements in the provision of flushing fluid in the vicinity of the bit head of a down-the-hole drill in order to facilitate the removal of rock chips from the hole. the fluid will normally be air but could be an air-liquid mixture or, in a purely hydraulic drill, liquid only. in a down-the-hole drill, the hammer mechanism acts directly on a drill bit at the bottom of the hole and the forces on the bit are direct and large. it is therefore necessary to use a bit of considerable strength. flushing fluid is supplied to the bit, often through a generally axial hole which extcnds through the shan of the bit to the face which acts on the floor of the hole, and sometimes through a series of grooves extending generally longitudinally along the shank of the bit and terminating at the face. it is also known (from lest german patent 1 238 864) to provide a pair of flushing holes in the bit, the holes leading from passages in the drill body to the top of the head and passing through the head. the holes are located opposite each btlier. it is hoever undesirable for the bit of a down-the-hole drill to be weakened by numerous internal cavities, so that a bit formed with two or more generally longitudinal holes through it is not as strong as may be wished. two holes are however generally considered desirable where the bit is of the blade type, being provided because of the symmetry of the crucifora blade arrangement at the face of the bit. apart from being structurally relatively weak, this arrangement also leads to undesirable turbulence and to closed air circuits at the bit head, which in turn lead to premature wear of the bit. in another arrangement (knows from united states patent 3 225 841) a central bore in the bit is provided, terminating in an orifice at the centre of the face. there is also a series of downwardly sloping passages extending from the central bore to the sides of the bit, where the passages end in grooves which direct the flushing air downwards to sweep the face of the bit. this arrangement suffers from the structural weakness inherent in bits with several internal cavities, and there is again considerable turbulence at the face, where the streams of flushing fluid converge, and hence premature wear. in out-of-the-hole drilling technology it is common to provide a longitudinal channel for flushing fluid along the drill stem or string which extends from the drill body to the bit. in such drills the head of the bit is usually considerably larger in diameter, compared to the diameter of the stem behind it, than is the case in down-the-hole drills, where the reduction in cross-sectional area of the apparatus directly behind the head of the bit is relatively slight since the casing housing the hammer mechanism is located immediately above the bit.

 claims:   1.   a bit   fr    a down-the-hole drill, the bit having a shank and a head and being formed with at least two cavities for conveying flushing fluid from the interior of the drill to the exterior, a first of the cavities extending to the face of the head, characterised in that the second cavity terminates above the face and is adapted to deflect upwards the flushing fluid which it conveys.   2.   the bit of claim 2, characterised in that the floor of the second cavity, where it leaves the bit, makes an included angle not greater than substantially 900 with the axis of the shank of the bit above such passage.   3.   the bit of claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the second cavity comprises'a groove in the surface of the bit adapted to abut the lower edge of the casing of the drill.   4.   the bit of any of the above claims, characterised in that the first and second cavities extend independently of each other in the bit.   5.   the bit of any of the above claims, characterised in that there is a plurality of second cavities   terminating    above the face.   6.   the bit of any of the above claims, characterised in that all the cavities are grooves formed in the exterior surface of the bit.      7.   the bit of any of claims 1 to 6, in which one of the cavities is a bore extending through at least a part of the bit, characterised in that this is the only bore for flushing fluid in the bit.   8.   the bit of any of the above claims, characterised in that it is a button bit.   9.   the bit of any of the above claims, characterised in that the first cavity is adapted to convey approximately one half or less of the flushing fluid to the face.   10.   the bit of claim 9, characterised in that the first cavity is adapted to convey   approximately      25 o    of the flushing fluid to the face.   11.   the bit of any of the above claims, in combination with a drill having at its lower end a casing adapted to contain the bit.
