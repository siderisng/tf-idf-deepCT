<ABSTRACT>
the (r,r) optical isomer of labetalol, namely 5-[ (r)-1-足 hydroxy- 2-[(r)-1-methyl- 3-phenylpropyl)amino ]ethyl]足 salicylamide, and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addi足 tion salts, in a state substantially free of the corresponding  (r,s), (s,r) and (s,s) optical isomers, are novel compounds  with favourable therapeutic properties in comparison with  labetalol.  they can be used in particular in the treatment of  hypertension.  the novel (r,r) optical isomer and its pharmaceutically  acceptable acid addition salts can be prepared by removal of  the protecting groups from an n,o-protected (r,r) optical  isomer or acid addition salt thereof, wherein the basic nit足 rogen atom and the phenolic hydroxy group are protected,  preferably by hydrogenolytic removal of hydrogenolysable  groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
a phenylalkylaminoethylsalicylamide, its pbeparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing it. this invention relates to a phenylalkylaminoethylsalicyl amid, its preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing it. more particularly it relates to one optical isomer of labetalol, 5-[l-hydroxy-2-(l-rnethyl-3- -phenylpropylamino)-ethyl] salicylamide. the substance labetalol is known from british patent specification 1,266,058 and u.s.p. 4,012,444. its pharmacological przoperties are discussed by farmer et. al. in british journal of pharmacology, 45: 660-675 (1972), who designate it ah5158; it is shown to block a- and ss-adrenergic receptors, suggesting that it would be useful in the treatment of arrhythmia, hypertension and angina pectoris. the unique pharmacological properties of labetalol and its use as an antihypertensive agent are said to be largely a function of the exquisite balance of its a- and blocking activities. the file history of u.s.p. 4,012,444 indeed indicates that slight changes in the chemical structure of labetalol deleteriously affect this balance, and, even in the few analogous compounds where the balance is retained, the absolute potencies of these compounds are shown to be too low for them to be useful antihypertensive agents. therefore, in the treatment of hypertension, labetalol is the compound of choice among those disclosed in british patent specification 1,266,058 and u.s.p. 4,012,444. labetalol has two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms and therefore can exist as two diastereoisomers and four optical isomers. indeed, british patent specification 1,266,058 and u.s.p. 4,012,444 disclose that compounds such as labetalol have optically active forms, but give no exampie of an optically active form. these patent specifications teach that "the racemic mixtures may be resolved by conventional methods, for example by salt formation with an optically active acid, followed by fractional crystallization but give no method of resolution. example 14 of each specification does indeed describe the separation of labetalol into two diastereoisomers "1" and "2", using benzoic acid, but this is not an optical resolution. in british patent specifications 1,541,932 and 1,541,933, "isomer 1" is designated "diastereoisomer a" and is characterised as that diastereoisomer whose hydrochloride salt has the higher melting point. these two british patent specifications also disclose that diastereoisomer a is a valuable antiarrhythmic agent since it has strongly reduced :-adrenergic blocking activity and is therefore useful in the treatment of people who have suffered myocardial infarction. we have now discovered that diastereoisomer a is composed of the (s,r) and (r,s) optical isomers of labetalol,- whereas 1 astereoisomer b is composed of the (s,s) and (rgr) optical isomers. we have also surprisingly found that the novel (r,r) optical isomer of labetalol exhibits, in comparison with labetalol itself, both an unexpectedly high increase in ss-adrener- gic blocking potency and a decrease in a-adrenergic blocking potency. thus, when the (r,r) optical isomer is compared with labetalol, the ratio of the xb-adrenergic blocking potency to the a-adrenergic blocking potency is found to be greatly and unexpectedly increased. in particular, animal tests have indicated that the (r,r) optical isomer has about twelve times the-.b-blocking potency of labetalol, but only about one third of the a-blocking potency of labetalol. these. properties could
