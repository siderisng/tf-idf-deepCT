<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to the manufacture of  suspension grade pvc and other vinyl chloride resins of  superior overall quality, especially in that they possess both  high bulk densities and excellent porosities as shown by  their fast absorption rates for hot liquid plasticizers.  the  key feature of the suspension polymerization process in­ volved is the use of a particular combination of two types of  suspending agents throughout the process, namely a poly­ vinyl alcohol resin with a hydrolysis level of about 68 to  about 78 percent together with a hydroxypropyl cellulose  ether with a molar substitution of between about 2 and  about 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the suspension polymerization of polyvinyl chloridebackground of the inventionthe present invention relates to the manufacture of synthetic polymers and, more particularly, to an improved process for the suspension polymerization of polyvinyl chloride (pvc) and the improved pvc resin produced thereby. in the suspension polymerization of pvc, vinyl chloride monomer (vcm), water, initiator, buffer, suspending agent and other additives are charged to a polymerization reactor under pressure, and the reaction is allowed to continue over a period of hours until the desired degree of polymerization is achieved. in commercial practice, it is not unusual to use more than one initiator, and/or buffer, and/or suspending agent, and, of course, comonomers and other additives are frequently added to the reactor before initiation of the polymerization reaction, or after partial or even complete polymerization of the vinyl chloride. the initiator, the suspending agent, the buffers, and other processing aids added to the reactor, as well as the temperature at which the reaction is carried out, can all affect not only the reaction itself but also the product. thus, the choice of suspending agent can affect not only the facility with which the polymerization reaction proceeds but also many characteristics of the pvc resin produced. the molecular weight, particle size distribution, porosity, bulk density and a wide variety of other properties may thus be affected by the choice of processing conditions and processing additives employed with reaction. the degree to which a given physical property may be truly "controlled" (as opposed to merely affected or altered) by variations in process conditions and/or process additives varies widely, though many are well-known and almost universal in the art, e.g., adjusting reactor temperatures to control molecular weight. in the past, it was well-known to employ a wide variety of suspending agents, including cellulose ether products such as methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, gelatin, inorganic salts, clays and the like and certain highly hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols (pva) to mention but a few. various combinations of these and other materials have all been employed from time to time in commercial manufacture of pvc suspension resins (see for instance de-a-2757529). any attempt to produce end products from pure pvc resin, by itself, would result in an extremely rigid, inflexible, probably useless product, which would have already suffered heat degradation in its formation, and which would be subject to further light degradation if it is kept for any period of time. in order to produce useful products from pvc, it is necessary for the pvc resin manufacturer, end user, or an intermediate "compounder" to admix light and heat stabilizers, in most cases at least some plasticizer, and other optional additives with the pvc resin, to produce a "pvc compound". for this reason, some of the most important physical properties of pvc resins are not those most readily apparent in the pvc resin, per se, but the properties which affect the further processing of that resin to produce pvc compounds and/or the physical properties of such pvc compound. pvc compounds produced
