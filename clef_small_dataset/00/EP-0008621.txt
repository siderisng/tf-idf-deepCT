<ABSTRACT>
Due to built-in crushing elements classifying and sorting drum winer, especially for household waste. The screen drum has a large diameter and is relatively short. The drum speed is relatively high. Stuffed garbage bags and pressed bale are torn open by sawtooth-shaped carrier sheets between the Siebsegments. The sievgut is prevented in the short drum by aperture-shaped installations or outlet openings at too fast axial flow. Brittle hard materials are selectively crushed in the drum through a baffle impeller in the area of ​​falling, in the drum-circulated benchstromes and z. b. Returned together with fines and kitchen waste by suitable screen perforation. For example, on the studs between the sieve holes hanging on textile waste, films or horticulture are skewed on S-shaped hooks, which are lined up on a wave walking through the drum and pivoted periodically through a stripping comb, which returns this clogging to the drum back into the drum. Soft paper can be selectively crushed by stirrer Sarme on a shaft passed through the drum and eliminated by deflections.
