<ABSTRACT>
coalescer cartridge comprises a fixed end support plate,  a moveable end support plate attached to an actuating rod  and a plurality of fibres or bundles of fibres.  each fibre or  bundle is secured at one end to one end plate and at its other  end to the other end plate.  in use the end plates are  positioned close to one another by movement of the rod so  that the fibres are compressed together to form a fine  network.  the cartridge is suitable for use in coalescing  emulsions of oil and water and removing any suspended  solids.  when the cartridge becomes blocked it is easily  regenerated by causing relative motion between the end  plates to stretch the fibres and open up the network.   contaminants are then removed by flushing with wash  liquid.
