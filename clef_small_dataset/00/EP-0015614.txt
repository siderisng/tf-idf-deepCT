<ABSTRACT>
manufacture of cleaving-tiles by extrusion of a ceramic  mass into a continuous column, which is cut into mouldings  of the desired tile length, which mouldings are subsequently  cleft after hardening.  the continuous extruded column (2)  is passed between forming rollers (9, 10) which provide  at least all the side edges of the column with a relief and is  next provided at both sides what will be the exposed tile  faces, at tile-length intervals and normal to the transport  direction with an additional relief, by means of impression  instruments (11, 12), and is severed at the place of this  additional relief.  severing of the extruded column at tile length and the  application of the additional relief can be effected inde­ pendently of each other at intervals equal to n x the desired  wet-tile length, whereby by preference n is equal to 1.  the column stands preferably on edge and is cut means  of two vertical parallel cutting devices (13, 14), disposed  at either side of what will be the exposed tile faces, and  moving synchronously towards each other.  for the purpose of obtaining mouldings of the correct  constant length, the periodic movement of the cutting in­ struments (13, 14) is coordinated with the travelling speed  of the extruded column (2), while, moreover, the actuation  mechanisms of the cutting instruments and the impression  instruments run synchronously.
