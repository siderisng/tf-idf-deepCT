<ABSTRACT>
liquid polyisocyanate compositions comprising:   (a) from 90 to 50% by weight of a reaction product of  diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a polyoxyalkylene polyol  having an average functionality of 2-3 comprising from  50-100% by weight of a polyoxypropylene diol or triol having  a hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 750 to 3000 and from  0-50% by weight of a polyoxyethylene diol or triol having  a hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 750 to 3000, said  reaction product having an nco content of from 8 to 26%  by weight, and   (b) from 10 to 50% by weight of a diphenylmethane  diisocyanate composition containing from 30 to 65% by  weight of diphenylmethane diisocyanate, the remainder  being polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of func­ tionality greater than two together with by-products formed  in the manufacture of such polyisocyanates by phosgena­ tion.  the compositions are useful in the manufacture of  polyurethanes, especially cold cure flexible foams.
