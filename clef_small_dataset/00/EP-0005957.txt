<ABSTRACT>
a ground-based portable and collapsible structure comprises  two similar rectangular plates hinged together and  disposed in downwardly-diverging relationship with their  hinge-remote edges engaging the bottoms of re-entrant slots  opening from the upper edges of spaced and parallel bar  means of inverted t-section disposed on the ground transverse  to said plate edges.  each bar means may be an  inverted t-section bar or two l-section bars secured to one  another with their vertical webs mutually opposite and  spaced, preferably by spindles on which spiked metal strips  are mounted for pivotal movement between a first position  wherein it is accommodated in said gap and a second  position wherein it projects downwardly from the l-section  bars, the two strips being offset one to each side of the  median plane bisecting said gap and being maintained in  such dispositions by spacers mounted on the spindles  alongside the strips.
