<ABSTRACT>
The device (handset) for foaming or spraying in particular cosmetic liquids consists of a handle for receiving a compressed air supply and a function-releasing finger-button (5), a support arm (15) with compressed air supply line (14b), a slightly releasably releasably secured to the support arm, with a spray nozzle (19) and a reservoir (17) for liquid firmly connected adapter head, wherein spray nozzle and liquid containers are mutually associated with each other. The front part of the support arm (15) contributes to receiving the adapter head a member of a two-part coupling connection, preferably a bayonet closure, while the eu field of the adapter head is formed as a corresponding counterlink. In the adapter head, three channels (18a, 18b, 18c) run. The one channel (18a) leads compressed air into the interior of the reservoir (17), from which liquid is supplied via a riser (20) and the other channel (18b) of the spray nozzle (19). Furthermore, compressed air flows from the air-conducting channel (18a) via a further transverse channel (18c) to the spray nozzle (19) and exudes the liquid from its departure funnel (21) or foams the liquid with attached seven application nozzle (23). Unirrant drop formation is avoided by a finger-button (5) controlled vent valve (11).
