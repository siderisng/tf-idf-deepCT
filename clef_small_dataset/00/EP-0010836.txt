<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to hydroponic grass growth.  hydroponic grass is grown by forming a seed-bed,  forming a supply of hydroponic nutrient solution including  water and water-soluble phosphate plant nutrient, periodi­ cally withdrawing from the nutrient supply a quantity of  solution in excess of that required to saturate the seed-bed  and applying this excess quantity to the seed-bed, and  draining the excess nutrient.  the water used to form the  hydroponic nutrient solution is pre-treated to separate  impurity metal ions which form water-insoluble metal phos­ phates.  the water-soluble phosphate plant nutrient is then  dissolved in the pre-treated water to form the nutrient solu­ tion without the precipitation of impurity metal phosphates.   apparatus for growing the grass is also disclosed.
