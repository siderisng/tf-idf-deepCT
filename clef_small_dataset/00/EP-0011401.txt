<ABSTRACT>
a process for the production of a cyano-substituted  aldehyde and/or alcohol by reacting an alkenenitrile with  carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a cobalt  catalyst.  the product may be hydrogenated in one step to the  diamine e. g.  e-pentenenitrile may be converted in two stages  to hexamethylene diamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
cyano-substituted aldehydes and alcohols the present invention relates to cyano-substituted aldehydes and/or alcohols. in our british patent no. 1,497,046 we have described a process for the manufacture of cyano-substituted aliphatic carboxylic esters in which an alkenenitrile having at least 3 carbon atoms in the alkene residue is reacted with carbon monoxide and an alcohol under pressure in the presence of a catalyst which is preferably a known carbonylation catalyst e.g. a transition metal. the alkenenitriles which are singled out in british patent no. 1,497,046 as being particularly useful in the process therein described are those of formula cnh2n 1cn where n is 4 or 5 e.g. 3-pentenenitrile which, on carbonylation with methanol for example, gives methyl i-cyanovalerate said to be convertible to adiponitrile by reaction with ammonia in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst, the adiponitrile in turn being capable of hydrogenation to hexamethylene diamine which is an important polymer intermediate. the process described in british patent no. 1,497,046 takes two stages to convert the cyano ester to hexamethylene diamine. we have now devised a process for the production from an alkenenitrile of a cyano-substituted product which may be converted in one step to hexamethylene diamine and under milder conditions than those required by the process of the british patent. according to one aspect of the invention a cyanosubstituted aldehyde and/or alcohol is produced by reacting an alkenenitrile having at least 3 carbon atoms in the alkene residue with carbon monoxide and hydrogen under pressure in the presence of a cobalt catalyst. according to a further aspect of the invention the cyano-substituted aldehyde and/or alcohol is converted to the corresponding diamine by hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen in the presence of ammonia and a hydrogenation catalyst. the alkenenitriles which are the starting materials for the process according to the invention include compounds of the formula cnh2n 1cn where n is an integer of 3 or more. in particular, compounds in which n is 3 to 10 especially 4 or 5 give valuable products when used in the process for example 3-butenenitrile, 2-methyl-3butenenitrile, 4-pentenenitrile, 5-hexenenitrile and, in particular, 3-pentenenitrile. the latter compound may be conveniently obtained by the hydrocyanation of butadiene e.g. as described in our british patent no. 1,429,651. the cobalt catalyst is preferably used in the process in the form of one of its compounds particularly as the carbonyl or carboxylate. the carboxylate may be aliphatic or aromatic i.. n; re, e.g. cobalt benzoate or cobalt naphthenate or a cobalt salt of a c1 to c25 alkanoic acid such as cobalt acetate or cobalt-stearate. the cobalt is present in the reaction in catalytic amounts, e.g. 1 to 2,000 preferably 50 to 500 parts per million. a biphyllic trivalent phosphorus-containing ligand may also be included in the reaction medium. the ligand may be a phosphite, phosphonite or phosphinite but is preferably a phosphine particularly a trialkylphosphine in which the alkyl groups each contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms. the presence of the ligand tends to produce a more linear cyano-aldehyde and/or
