<ABSTRACT>
a foamable extrudate is extruded through the orifice (25),  preferably arcuate, of an extrusion die (24).  immediately adja­ cent and downstream of the die orifice are opposed sets of  curved rollers (47, 48), each having substantially the same cen­ ter of curvature as the die orifice.  the roller set (48) on one  side of the extrudate pass line is adjustable as a set with re­ spect to and substantially parallel to the pass line, while the  rollers of the set (47) on the opposite side are adjustable indi­ vidually cach to float with controlled pressure against the ex­ trudate as it expands and moves between the roller sets.  each  roller is comprised of a plurality of thin, cylindrical, circular wa­ fers (195) which are drivingly interconnected and journaled on  curved cure shafts (50).  the wafers of opposed rollers in each  set are individually driven for rotation at a controlled speed so  that each opposed pair of rolls acts as a traction drive for the  extrudate as it exits radially from the die orifice, such rollers  controlling the expansion and movement of the extrudate  while minimizing cell distortion.  a surface finisher (45) is pro­ vided downstream of the roll sets which comprises opposed  extrudate engaging planar surfaces (120, 121) positioned on  the opposite sides of the extrudate, one (121) being adjustably  yet fixedly supported while the other (120) is adjustably and  floatingly supported pivotally at its center of gravity to exert a  controlled flating pressure on the extrudate.
