<ABSTRACT>
light processing apparatus (20) comprises a piezoelectric  high polymeric film (1) supported under tension at least at two  opposite ends (2, 3) thereof, at least one pair (8 or 9) of  electrodes arranged to produce an electric field (e) across the  thickness of the polymeric film and optical means (19) conÂ­ nected to the polymeric film such that said optical means can  be displaced upon piezoelectric response of the film to a  voltage applied across the electrode.  the optical means may  be a mirror or a lens fixed to the polymeric film.  the apparatus  can be used to control accurately, for example, the angle  through which a light beam is reflected.

<DESCRIPTION>
description title: light processing apparatus the present invention relates to a light processing apparatus using a piezoelectric polymeric film. more particularly, it relates to an apparatus for processing a light beam by changing the spatial position or arrangement of an optical means. as a result of the expanding use of light in information processing, a variety of apparatuses have been developed for changing the spatial position or arrangement of an optical means such as mirrors and lens. however, most of the prior art apparatuses employ elaborate mechanical systems and each apparatus is generally only useful for some specific application. a simple light processing apparatus has now been devised incorporating a piezoelectric polymeric film and which can be used in a wide variety of applications. accordingly, the present invention provides light processing apparatus comprising a piezoelectric high polymeric film supported under tension at least at two opposite ends thereof, at least one pair of electrodes arranged to produce an electric field across the thickness of the polymeric film and optical means connected to the polymeric film such that said optical means can be displaced upon piezoelectric response of the film to a voltage applied across the electrodes. the apparatus of the invention can be operated by relatively simple electric control signals and is capable of changing the direction of a light beam through a wide angle. it is possible to displace the optical means with a high degree of accuracy and accordingly the apparatus of the invention is capable of accurate optical information processing. the light processing apparatus of the invention can take the form of at least one piezoelectric high polymeric film fixed under tension at least at two longitudinally opposed ends thereof, with two pairs of electrodes provided on the polymeric film. optical means can be fixed to the polymeric film between pairs of electrodes disposed along the longitudinal direction of the polymeric film. in use, voltages are applied across the electrodes of each electrode pair so that an expansion produced in the length of a polymeric film by one electrode pair can be the same as a contraction in the length of the film caused by a second pair of electrodes, and vice versa. a push-pull motion of the optical means can thereby be produced. direct current or alternating current voltage may be used. this invention will now be described in more detail referring to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of light processing apparatus of this invention; figure 2 is a schematic front view of a second embodiment of light processing apparatus of this invention figure 3 is a schematic front view of a third embodiment of light processing apparatus of this invention; figure 4 is a schematic front view of a fourth embodiment of light processing apparatus of this invention; and figure 5 is a perspective view of a fifth embodiment of light processing apparatus of this invention. in figure 1, a rectangular piezoelectric high polymeric film
