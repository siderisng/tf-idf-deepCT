<ABSTRACT>
A steam generator, preferably for use in nuclear power plants, which has a plurality of, in series, and in a common container (1) arranged helical tube bundle (5) in which the steam is generated and then overheated. The individual tube bundles are separated by intermediate spaces (16) in which the frame connecting pipes are arranged. Investigate and possibly leak-threatened places, eg. b. The welded joints between individual pipe lengths are for the purpose of lighter accessibility in these spaces. In the same container, pipe bundles (21) are also arranged in which the steam is overheated. In the middle of the container, a central tube (4) is arranged, in which the feedwater supply (6) is guided and that, in operation by a rupture washer (15) closed, optionally the products of a liquid metal water reaction can dissipate. Specific embodiments of the feedwater distributors (8-11) are proposed, which increase the safety of the steam generator egg such incidents, e.g. b. Record the recoil forces of demolished pipelines. Also proposed are embodiments of the steam collectors (27), which facilitate the inspection of the tube bundles.
