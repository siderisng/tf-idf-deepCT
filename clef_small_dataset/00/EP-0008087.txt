<ABSTRACT>
an arrangement for the encrypted transmission of information items, particularly speech, by means of a controllable memory device (s) into which the incoming information items are successively stored at the transmitting end, subdivided into time elements, and are read out again exchanged in time with one another for their transmission and in which this exchanging of the time elements is cancelled again at the receiving end.  the exchange or re-exchange of the time elements in the memory device in this arrangement is carried out by the inversion of successive information sections (za) which are in each case determined by a predetermined number of successive time elements.  <image>
