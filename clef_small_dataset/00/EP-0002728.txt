<ABSTRACT>
for the theft-proof attachment of plates (2), e. g.  motor vehicle licence plates, to a supporting structure (3), headed bolts (4) are used, which penetrate through the plate (2) and the supporting structure (3) and which have a flat, smooth head part (7) and engaging threaded parts (5), e. g.  nuts having a threaded ring part (9) which is, for example, spherical or of truncated conical shape on the outside, and a non-threaded tool-attachment part (12), which is held as one piece in connection with this threaded ring part (9) via a preset breaking point (11).  in order further to improve the security effect, the flat, smooth head part (7) of the bolt (4) is provided with an elongated, e. g.  rectangular, oval or elliptical, outline (18, 19).  the plate (2) which is penetrated by the bolt shank (6) is moreover fitted on its rear face with a preset breaking point (22) in the region against which the head part (7) rests, the said preset breaking point (22) extending over a surface area (2') which is significantly greater than the surface area (18, 19) overlapped or covered by the head part (7).  if the attempt is made to remove the plate (2) forcefully, large holes are torn in it in the area of the attachment device (1) which render reuse of the said plate impossible.  <image>
