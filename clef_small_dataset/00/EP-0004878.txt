<ABSTRACT>
a process for the purification of crude chlorophosphazene  involves the use of an intermediate purification  stage in which the crude chlorophosphazene is subjected to  at least two water-washings, following which a final purification  step is conducted utilizing a conventional chlorophosphazene  purification procedure, such as recrystallization,  sublimation, distillation, or melt-filtering and at least a very  high purity cyclic chlorophosphazene trimer is then recovered.   in a preferred process, the crude chlorophosphazene  is subjected to three water-washings prior to the final  purification step.
