<ABSTRACT>
a cathode ray tube storage device has a display panel 26  incorporated in which is a layer of electroluminescent material  which exhibits hysteresis characteristics.  an a. c.  voltage  source 28 is connected to apply a bias a. c.  field across the  electroluminescent layer, the rms value of which lies between  the extinction and threshold values for the material.  a  charge pattern representing information to be displayed is  written on the panel 26 by an electron beam 42 from an  electron gun 14 as a result of which corresponding areas of  the electroluminescent material are excited to produce a  light output.  the intensity of the light output varies with the  intensity of the exciting electron beam 42.  the electroluminescent  layer can be either directly excited by the electron  beam, or by a light output produced by electron beam radiation  of an intervening layer of cathodoluminescent material  also incorporated in the panel 26.
