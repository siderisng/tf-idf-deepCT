<ABSTRACT>
a bipolar shunting device for multipolar electric lines  formed by a box-type contact unit which may be fitted  slidingly in substantially u-shaped sections, which support  internally two opposite sets of electric insulated wires and  by a box-type connection unit provided outside of said  sections.  in the contact unit three movable contacts are  provided, which are operated by a lever control placed  outside of the connection unit.  the device comprises also a two-position selecting  unit able to connect itself alternately to either of two of the  movable contacts while the third contact is constantly conÂ­ nected to the lever control.
