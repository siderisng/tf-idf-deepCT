<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns apparatus for detecting pollu­ tion of an aqueous effluent by soluble organic or inorganic  compounds.  the apparatus contains a sampler (19), an  effluent reservoir (17), a clean water reservoir (11), a  thermostatically controlled bath (15), a coalescer (1), a  charcoal filter (2), a differential refractive index detector  (3) and a u. v.  detector (4).  effluent is intermittently sent  through the apparatus from its reservoir (17) and at other  times clean water of known purity is sent from its reservoir  (11) through the apparatus.  a comparison of the readings  obtained in detectors (3) and (4) enables one to determine  qualitatively the presence of soluble hydrocarbons and  organic and inorganic soluble products in the aqueous  effluent.

<DESCRIPTION>
dftection of pollution this invention relates to appartus for detecting ollut; of an aqueous effluent ty soluble organic or inorganic coitipounds. there is a need for n apparatus or a device which enables one continuously to take aqueous samples of sewage and to determine the extent of accidental pollution by pollutants. we have flow devised an apparatus for this purpose and which can be adapted to set off quickly an alarm so that adequate remedial action can be taken. according to this ir.vention, an apparatus fer detecting pollution of an aqueous effluent comprises: (a) a sampling device. (b) a reservoir for aqueous effluent, (c) a filter upstream of said reservoir (b), (d) a filter downstream of said reservoir (b), (e) a reservoir for water of known purity, (l) a filter downstream of said reservoir (e), (g) a thermostatically controlled bath connected by conduit to both reservoirs (b) and (e), (h) a coalescer downstream of said bath (g), (i) a device for absorbing hydrocarbons connected by conduit to coalescer (h). (j) either a differential refractive index detector connected by conduit to coalescer (h), or a conductimeter connected by conduit to bath (g) or by conduit to coalesce (h), (k) a u.v. detector downstream of said device (i) (1) means for conveying water of known purity from its reservoir (e) through filter (f), bath (g), coalescer (h), device (i), detector (k) and detector or conductimeter (j). and (m) means for conveying a sample of aqueous effluent frozen its reservoir (b) through filter (d) t bath (g), coalescer (h), device (i),detector (k) and detector or conductimeter (j). by comparing the readings obtained in the detector or conductimetr (j) and detector (k) > with on the one hand water of known purity and on the otlier hand effluent one is able to determine at least qdalitativcly the pollution in the effluent. before the water of known purity thereinafdsr rtxerred to as ',:i water") and effluent are tested they must be collie lewd in reservol.st there are separate reservoirs for lean water and icr effluent. th means of valves and a pump, the clean water and efftxlent can be separately conveyed to their respective reservoirs. the effluent and optionall)- clean water should also pass through filters before tbey pass to their reservoirs and also after they leave their reservoirs. a sample of the aqueous effluent is transferred to its reservoir (b) by means of the sampling device (a), and this conveniently is achieved by means of a suction/compression device to be described in more detail later. the clean water reservoir (e) may be provided with a level detector which operates the valve allowing clean water to enter its reservoir (e). also the conduit through which the clean water passes on its wy to the reservoir (e) may be provided with a security device which stops the apparatus should clean water not be available the clean water which may be for example tap water, deionized water or distilled water supplies both its reservoir and the therncs-
