<ABSTRACT>
multiterminal, high voltage d. c.  power networks in which  the sub-terminals are electrically isolated from each other  comprise d. c.  transformers, as the terminals.  each trans­ former comprises a large number of efficient, high energy  batteries, connected as two separate groups: one group made  up of paralleled long strings of series connected batteries and  the other group made up of paralleled short strings of one or  more batteries each.  each transformer also comprises auto­ matic monitoring, control and switching means for periodi­ cally exchanging charged and discharged strings between the  two groups, one of which - the "primary" - is connected across  the supply lines from the power source(s) for the network and  the other of which - the "secondary" - is connected across the  service lines providing power to users thereof.
