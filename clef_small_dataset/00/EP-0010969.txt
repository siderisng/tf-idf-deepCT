<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for water softening uses  less than approximately 20 micron diameter fine mesh  magnetized ion exchange particles (14) in columnar  operation.  the particles (14) are formed by encapsulating  a core of magnetic material in ion exchange resin.  the  particles are magnetized and disposed in a column (10)  where they attach to magnetic mesh retention means (12)  such as stainless steel wool.  the design of the column (10)  permits use of the fine mesh ion exchange particles (14)  and their properties of rapid exchange rates and efficient  utilization of resin capacity while avoiding prior art  problems of plugging, fouling, and excessive pressure  drop.
