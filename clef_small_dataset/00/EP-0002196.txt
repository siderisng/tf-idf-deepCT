<ABSTRACT>
polymers of anionically polymerized monomers such as  mono-olefins, conjugated dienes, vinyl substituted aromatics,  vinyl substituted pyridine, vinyl substituted quinolines,  various aldehydes, various epoxides, various oxetanes,  various oxygen-containing compounds, and the like are  produced and end capped with a polyisocyanate or  polyisothiocyanate having the formula r(n=c=x)n wherein  r is a hydrocarbon, n is 2 or 3, and x is oxygen or sulfur.   such end capped polymers, of course, contain one reacted or  connected isocyanate or isothiocyanate group and at least  one free isocyanate or isothiocyanate end group, which free  end group(s) reacts with an amide to give an imide end  group.  the imide terminated polymer is then hydrolyzed to  form a stable amine terminated polymer.  the reaction of the  amide compound with the isocyanate(s) or isothiocyanate(s),  followed by hydrolysis, results in the replacement of the free  isocyanate or isothiocyanate end group(s) with an amine  group(s).  thus, the amine terminated polymer contains the  polymer connected to an isocyanate or isothiocyanate group  (now an amide group or a thioamide group), which in turn is  attached to the hydrocarbon portion, that is, the "r" portion  of the polyisocyanate, which in turn is connected to the  formed amine group.  the amine terminated polymers may  be stored extended periods of time and then reacted with  various polymers, prepolymers, monomers, or various combinations  thereof to form various block or graft copolymers.   that is, the amine terminated polymer may be subsequently  reacted with any amine reactive compound such as diepoxy  monomers or an epoxy prepolymer in the presence of known  epoxy catalysts to give a blocked epoxy copolymer.  similarly,  the amine terminated polymer may be reacted with urea  prepolymers or urea-forming monomers to yield a block  urea copolymer.  reaction of the amine terminated polymer  with urethane polymers, urethane prepolymers, or urethane-forming  monomers will yield a urethane block copolymer.   reaction of the amine terminated polymer with urethane-urea  prepolymers or urethane-urea forming monomers will  yield a urethane-urea block copolymer.  similarly, various  dianhydride and diamine monomers may be utilized to form  an imide block copolymer.
