<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides cross-linking agents for com­ pounds containing an average of at least two primary or  secondary amine groups per molecule, and particularly  amine group-containing polymers, and compositions con­ taining the same.  the cross-linking agents comprise an  amino-formaldehyde product with an average of at least two  activated carboxylic ester groups per molecule and having the  structure     -x--or   wherein x is selected from the group consisting essentially of    and wherein r is an aliphatic moiety, and r′ is alkyl of 1-8  carbon atoms.  compositions comprising compounds con­ taining an average of at least two primary or secondary amine  groups and the novel crosslinking agents are useful for coat­ ing substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
cross-linking agents for amine-group containing compounds and compositions containing same. this invention relates to zoss-linking agents for compounds which are cross-linked through pendant primary or secondary amine groups thereon. the crosslinking agents are essentially amino-formaldehyde products which have been modified to contain activated carboxylic ester groups. the invention further relates to the resultant cross-linked product. in particular this invention relates to cross-linking agents prepared from melamine resins modified by activated carboxylic ester groups. amino resins find use in surface coatings, and adhesives for metals, textiles, wood, etc. most of the presently used amino cross-linking agents cross-link under acidic conditions with polymers containing alcoholic hydroxy, amide, and carboxylic acid groups. many of these anionic polymers, and amino cross-linking agents are used in anodic electrodeposition of paints on metals. in the last 10 years, a number of patents have claimed many advantages of cathodic electrocoating systems over anodic electrocoating systems, especially in improved chemical resistant properties of the cationic films obtained by cathodic electrodeposition. the most common method described in the literature to crosslink such cationic systems is via a blocked polyisocyanate which de-blocks at high temperatures to form a polyisocyanate, which in turn cross-links with cationic polymers. however, during de-blocking volatiles come off which are toxic and pollute the envinonment. u.s. patent, 3,519,627 discloses carboxyl-modified ethers of amino-formaldehyde condensates as cross-linking agents for other carboxyl-,hydroxyl-, or amide-containing resins. these cross-linking agents are inoperative as such for products containing pendant primary or secondary amine groups. u.s. patent 4,026,855 discloses cross-linking agents for cationic polymers of certain basicity with functional groups such as carboxy, hydroxy and amide groups. the cross-linking agents do not react with primary or secondary amine groups. french paent 1,544,21 discloses transetherification of melamine-formaldehyde condensation products with butyl glycolate and then hydrolyzing them to form carboxylic acid-group containing water-soluble anionic resins as stated to be useful in electrocoating. accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to produce cross-linking agents to react with primary or secondary amine groups on a compound, especially, a polymer, and most especially, a cationic polymer. it is a further object to produce cross-linking agents which are useful at reduced reaction temperatures. these and other objects will be apparent fran the following disclosure. the present cross-linking agents are prepared from amino-formaldehyde products and activated carboxylic esters. amino-formaldehyde products useful herein may be obtained by condensation of formaldehyde and an amino compound such as melamine, urea, benzoguanamine, formaguanamine, acetoguanamine, glycoluril, cyclic ureas such as ethylene urea, propylene urea, 4,5-dihydroxy-ethylene urea and other similar materials. these formaldehyde condensation products contain methylol groups and all or part of these methylol groups may be etherified with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol, or butanol. the etherification may be carried out under acidic reaction conditions. the reaction conditions employed for methylolation and subsequent alkylation by alcohols are well known in the art. depending upon the type of conden sat ion product desired the reaction may be carried out under acid or base and with varying conditions of time
