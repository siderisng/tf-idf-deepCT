<ABSTRACT>
the regeneration of polymeric adsorbent having oil  adsorbed thereon is achieved by contacting the adsorbent  with specified non-ionic surfactant at a ph of 9 to 13.  this  regeneration process is used in a process for recovering  oil from water contaminated with said oil.  the oil-contaminated  water is passed through a bed of polymeric adsorbent  which is capable of preferentially adsorbing the oil, and  substantially oil-free water passes from said column.  the  regeneration of adsorbent is achieved by eluting the adsorbed  oil with an aqueous solution of non-ionic surfactant  at a ph of 9 to 13 said surfactant having the general formula  rnh(ch₂ch₂o)nh wherein r is an alkyl group of  from 10 to 24 carbon atoms, and n is from 1 to 25.  the ph  of the oil-containing eluate is adjusted to 2 to 6 thereby  creating a two phase liquid of oil and acidified surfactant  solution from which the oil is removed and the ph of the  acidified surfactant is readjusted to 9 to 13 for reuse.
