<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to an apparatus for dis足 pensing propagation pots.  the stocked pots are maganized in parallel rows of  shafts above an underlying reciprocable drawer, on which is  placed a tray.  the number of cavities in the tray correspond  to the number of shafts in the above lying magazine.  by the reciprocable movement of the drawer some of the  pots will be pushed down in the cavities of the tray, when the  drawer is moved out, and the rest of the pots when the draw足 er is moved in again.  it would have been impossible to move the drawer reci足 procable, when not the support part 12a on the drawing, cor足 responding to the invention, had protruded overlapping the  support ledge part 12b and the support part 12a had had a  downward sloping terminating point 41.
