<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to rowing rigs for use on rowing  vessels and to outriggers for use in such rigs.  a scull (10) has a fixed seat (14) and a stretcher (16)  slidably mounted in guides (15).  an outrigger (17) is provided  to support an oar by means of rowlock (22) at its free end.  the  other end of outrigger (17) is pivotably mounted on scull (10)  about vertically extending axis (21).  a coupling element (24)  couples outrigger (17), whereby as the stretcher is moved  fore-and-aft during rowing the outrigger (17) is pivoted about  axis (21).  the coupling position of element (24) to outrigger  (17) is adjustable.  in an alternative embodiment the outrigger (17) is proÂ­ vided with an interconnecting member which assists raising  of the blade of an oar.  forms of the invention for conventional rowing boats are  also described.
