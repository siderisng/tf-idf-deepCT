<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a labeling device for labeling flat objects, such as compact cassettes, video cassettes or the like, with in a storage stack for handover on label holder on arranged labels, wherein the label holder with the lubrication of the labels with negative pressure loading bare suction drilling and with recesses of the stalls and breakthroughs as well as bounds of the ETI chains corresponding, bevelled protrusions are seen, and with a device for adhesive make the labels. The label holder are arranged radially movable on at least one stepwise circumferential rotor and from this to a stationary functional stations, namely a transfer station, an order station and a recess station. On the round runner head, a continuously advanced transport chain with the objects sliding cam is provided. The hangstation for applying the labels to the Ge states is equipped with one of the objects from the lifting platform that is exchanged by the ongoing transport chain over the height of the cams.
