<ABSTRACT>
trailer having a plurality of ground wheels (20), a towing  connection (70) and means for preventing (80, 81) or indicating  unreadiness for use of the connection unless the trailer is in a  towing condition.  the ground wheels (20) may be retractable  relative to a floor structure (13) from respective operative posi­ tions from which they transmit the weight of the trailer to the  ground to enable it to be transported, to respective inoperative  positions in which the weight of the trailer is transmitted to the  ground at least primarily by supporting means other than said  ground wheels (20) and in this case said towing condition is  when the wheels (20) are in their operative position.  alternatively or in addition the trailer may have a tail gate  lift said towing condition in this case being when the tail gate is  secured in a raised position.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in or relating to trailers description of invention this invention relates to trailers having a plurality of ground wheels and a towing connection whereby the trailer can be connected to a tractor vehicle. trailers can frequently be in a non-towing condition where they have equipmeitwhich can be in a condition where it is dangerous or otherwise undesirable for the trailer to be towed. for example, the ground wheels may be retractable relative to a floor structure of the trailer from respective operative pbsitions, in which they transmit the weight of the trailer to the ground to enable it to be transported, to respective in-operative positions, in which the weight of the trailer is transmitted to the ground at least primarily by supporting means other than said ground wheels.it is dangerous f±jr#.such a trailer to be towed when the ground wheels are not secured in their operative position and hence when the trailer is not in a towing condition. in another example the trailer may have a tailgate lift and it is dangerous for the trailer to be towed when the tailgate is not secured in a raised position and hence the trailer is again not in a towing condition. other situations where it is not safe or desirable to tow the trailer unless the trailer is in a towing condition will be recognised by a person skilled in the art. the invention as claimed is intended to provide a trailer having a plurality of ground wheels and a towing connection which is safe to use by providing means for preventing, or indicating unreadiness for use of, the towing connection unless the trailer is in a towing condit ion the possibility of the trailer being used inadvertently in an unsafe condition is avoided. the trailer may have a cover movable, into and out of a position in which the towing connection is obstructed, by a drive means actuated by a sensor which senses whether the trailer is in a towing condition. alternatively, the trailer may be provided with means to operate a switch in an electric circuit when a sensor indicates that the trailer is not in a towing condition and the electric circuit being arranged to operate an indicating means. the indicating means may comprise a visual and/or audible indicating means. the ground wheels may be retractable relative to a a floor structure of the trailer from respective operative positions, in which they transmit the weight of the trailer to the ground to enable it to bettransported, to respective inoperative positions in which the weight of the trailer is transmitted to the ground at least primarily by supporting means other than the said ground wheels and said sensor may sense that said wheels are in said operative position and hence that the trailer is in a towing condition. alternatively, the trailer may have a tailgate lift and said sensor may sense that said tailgate lift is in a raised position and hence that the trailer is in a towing

claims   1. a trailer having a plurality of ground wheels and a towing connection characterised in the provision of means for preventing, or indicating unreadiness for use of, the towing connection unless the trailer is in a   a   towing condition.   2. a trailer according to claim 1 wherein the trailer has a cover movable into and out of a position in which the towing connection is obstructed by a drive means actuated by a sensor which senses whether the trailer is in a towing condition.   3. a trailer according to claim 1 wherein the trailer is provided with means to operate a switch in an electric circuit when a sensor indicates that the trailer is not in a towing condition and the electric circuit being arranged   to.    operate an indicating means.   4. a trailer according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the ground wheels are retractable relative to a floor structure of the trailer from respective operative positions, in which they transmit the weight of the trailer to the ground to enable it to be transported, to respective inoperative positions, in which the weight of the trailer is transmitted to the ground at least primarily by supporting means   otherithan    the said ground wheels and said sensor senses that said wheels are in said operative position and hence that the trailer is in a towing condition.     5. a trailer according to claim 4 when dependent on claim 2 wherein the cover is operatively coupled to the mechanism for retracting the wheels, or to a mechanism for locking the wheels in said operative position, so that the cover is moved into a position in which said towing connection is obstructed unless the wheels are in, or are locked in, their operative position.   6. a trailer according to claim 4 when dependent on claim 3 wherein the means to operate the electric switch is operatively coupled to the mechanism for retracting the wheels, or to a mechanism for locking the wheels in said operative position, so that the switch is operated to actuate the warning means unless the wheels are in, or are locked in, their operative position.   7. a trailer according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the trailer comprises a transportable building comprising an insulated body structure carried on a rigid floor structure affording a habitable space.   8. a trailer according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the trailer has a tailgate lift and said sensor senses that said tailgate lift is in a raised position and hence that the trailer is in a towing condition.   9. a trailer according to claim 4 or any one of claims 5 to 8 when dependent on claim 4 wherein a locking means is provided to hold the wheels positively in an operative position during transport.      10. a trailer according to claim 4 or any one of claims 5 to 9 when dependent on claim 4 wherein each wheel is carried at one end of an arm which at its other end is pivotally mounted on or adjacent to the floor structure and associated with each such arm there is provided   anaixiliary    arm which is pivotally connected to the wheel arm at or adjacent the position where the latter is itself pivotally supported and at a position remote from the point at which the two arms are pivotally interconnected they are further interconnected by the shock absorbing means, the assembly of wheel arms and auxiliary arms being movable about the first mentioned pivot between operative and retracted positions.
