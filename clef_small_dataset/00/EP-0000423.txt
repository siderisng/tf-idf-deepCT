<ABSTRACT>
a tire building machine of the second-stage type includes  a housing (10) with a main shaft (13) journaled in  and projecting from the housing in cantilever fashion.  distal  and proximal flanges (134, 106) are mounted on the  shaft for axial movement toward and away from each other  and for rotation with the shaft, each flange being supported  on the shaft by an elongated sliding sleeve (100, 96), the  distal flange being secured to its sleeve by a readily removable  nose piece (115 or 130) supporting the flange  axially offset from the distal end of its sleeve, the sleeve  for the distal flange being slidably supported by an elongated  bushing (102) at its proximal end only while the sleeve  for the proximal flange is slidably supported by bushings  (99, 103) at each end, one (96) riding on the shaft while  the other (103) rides on the sleeve for the distal flange.   each sleeve is driven for axial movement form its inner end  by a screw shaft (89) journaled in the main shaft and  having identical but opposite hand threaded sections both  in the cantilevered portion of the shaft and outside the  housing.  the simplified construction permits both flanges  readily to be removed and replaced by flanges of a different  sixe.  the construction of the shaft and flange supporting  sleeves is such that no outboard support is required for  the shaft with deflection and run-out being minimized.
