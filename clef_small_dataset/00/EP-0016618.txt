<ABSTRACT>
a device for interconnecting drawer wall panels com­ prises two hingedly interconnected parts 50, 51 connectible  to adjacent drawer wall panels 20, and catch means 72, 73, 76  for retaining the parts in positions at right angles to one  another.  the catch means comprises external end caps 72  carried by one of the parts at each end of a hollow corner  post which is formed when the parts are assembled, the end  caps 72 having inturned lips 73 resiliently engageable with  complementary retaining members 76 on the other part of  the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
furniture drawers this invention relates to furniture drowers and to components for use in constructing drawers. proposals have been mode for drawers consisting of wall panels hinged together so that they con be pockaged and sold in a generally flat condition and then assembled to form the drawer, catch means being provided to watch the purts in their assembled positions at 900 to one another. hitherto such catch means have been provided internolly of corner piece parts which are located at the hinged regions, the catch mains then being hidden. however such arrongements suffer from a number of disadvantages. the moulds required in order to make the catch means are complex, and scrap material trimming can be difficult and time consuming. also, the size of the catch means is limited which makes it difficult to achieve reliable latching action, and the catches are susceptible to breakage. it is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate some or all of these disadvantages. the invention provides a device for interconnecting drawer wall panels, the device comprising two håangedly inter- ,' connected parts respectively connectlble to adacent drawer wall panels, and catch means for retaining said parts in positions at right angles to one another, the catch means comprising at least one external end cap carried by one of said parts and resiliently engageable with a complementary retaining member on the other port. preferably similar catch means are provided at the upper and lower ends of the associaeed part. preferably said parts co-operate to form a hollow corner post which is of rectangular shope in plan and remains exposed after assembly of the wall panels, said end cåap:forming an end closure for said post in the assembled condition. -preferably also the, or each said end cap is formed with a downturned lip at its free end adcpted for locking engagement with the associated retaining member. the outer surface of said lip may be curved to conform to the curvature of the edges of the wall panels in appropriate cases, an embodiment of the invention wili now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of part of-a drawer system using folding corner pieces embodying the inventionrprior to assembly; fig. 2 is a perspective view of a corner piece used in fig. 1 in its assembled condition; and figs. 3, 4 and 5 are front, top and bock views respectively of the corner piece of fig. 2 opened out. referring to fig. 1,- there are shown two sections 10,, 12 of drawer wall panel formed from extruded plastics matesiol. the former¯ to represent a drawer side (much shortened fox illustration only) and the latter to represent a drawer back. the drawer side 10 is engageable with a front connector 14 at its forward end for attachment to a drawer front, ond a folding corner piece 16 is engogeable with the rear end of the pnel-lo for connection
