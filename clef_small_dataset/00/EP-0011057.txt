<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the preparation, with high performance, vincadifformine and related derivatives, of the general formula I in the general formula given above, R₁ and R₂ are equal or different being chosen from hydrogen, the groups hydroxy, acyloxy, carbamate, halogen, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl, r₃, r₄ and r₆ represent lower or hydrogen alkyl or a combination of these radius Caus, a represents an alkyl chain containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms and which can be substituted by one or more alkyl, hydroxy or lower hydroxyalkyl groups. The compounds of the formula I serve as starting products for the synthesis of vincencamine and other related derivatives with pecuning psychopharmacological properties. N-benzyl-tetrahydro-γ-carbolin (which is advantageously obtained from the n-benzyl-4-piperidone to the n-benzyl-4-piperidone phenyl-hydrazone and reacting the latter composed in The conditions of the "Indolic synthesis of Fisher") undergoes a halogenation with t-butyl hypochlorite to obtain a chlorino Lenin which is treated directly with a metal derivative of dialkyl malonate to form a 3-benzyl-1, 2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroazepino (4,5-b) indole-5,5-di (alkyl carboxylate), which is hydrogenated to form a 1,2,3,4,5,6 -HEXA Hydroazepino (4,5-B) Indole-5,5-DI (alkyl carboxylate), this compound is then condensed with a functional aldehyde, for example a halogenated aldehyde, p. e. 5- Bromo-2-ethylpentanal, to form vincadiffine or a related derivative to it by passing through an intermediate compound, a salt of 3.3- (alkenyl) -1,2,3,4,5,6- Hexahy dazzepino (4.5-b) indolinium-5,5-di (alkyl carboxylate).
