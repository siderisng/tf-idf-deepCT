<ABSTRACT>
a consolidation system for articles including a continu­ ous track (32) with continuous article storage means (26) sup­ ported from the track and movable in a horizontal direction  around the track.  horizontally spaced and vertically extending  baskets (38) are located on the article storage means (26) with  each basket having vertically spaced compartments.  drive  means (40) are provided for driving the article storage means  around the track.  an operator work station (56) is located at a fixed position  on the outside of the track.  a conveyor (22) is provided to  move the articles adjacent the work station (56) and means  (58) are provided to deliver preselected articles from the con­ veyor (22) to the operator work station (56).  the article storage  means can be moved a predetermined degree to align a pre­ selected basket (38) with the work station (56).  a predetermined vertical compartment on the pre­ selected basket can be indicated (28) at the work station for  introducing articles into the predetermined vertical compart­ ment and a predetermined vertical compartment of the pre­ selected basket can also be indicated (28) at the work station  for removing the combination of articles therein.  an outgoing  (66) conveyor moves combinations of articles from the work  station (56).
