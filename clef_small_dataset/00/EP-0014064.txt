<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacture of a disubstituted (n-­ cyanoimido)carbonate of the formula:    in which r¹ and r² are the same and are alkyl radicals of  1 to 6 carbon atoms or phenyl radicals, or r¹ and r² are  joined to form an ethylene or propylene chain which is op­ tionally substituted by 1 or 2 alkyl radicals each of 1 to 3  carbon atoms, by reaction of a disubstituted imidocarbona­ te of the formula;    with cyanamide, characterised in that reaction is conduct­ ed in a two phase-system containing water and a water-­ immiscible organic solvent.  a process for the manufacture of compound ii by  reaction of cyanogen chloride or cyanogen bromide with  the appropriate alcohol or diol.  in a two phase system  containing and a water-immisable organic solvent.
