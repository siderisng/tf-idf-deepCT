<ABSTRACT>
the bead breaker is comprised of two blades (50,140)  held in immobile spaced relation relative one to the other, the  two blades defining two spaced working faces in a common  plane adapted to lie flush against the bead area (18) of a tire  (14) when the two blades are butted against a rim's flange in  initial set up position prior to breaking the tire's bead away  from the rim.  the blades (36,37) are preferably formed from  curved plates having a common curvature axis (75) that axis  being angled relative to the median plane (35) of the rim (13) in  a direction away from the rim's center when the two blades  are butted against the rim's flange (17) in the set up position.   the curvature of the blades (36,37) preferably is such that no  point on the rim edge of each blade is spaced away from the  rim's flange a distance greater than about two times the tire's  bead core (90) diameter when the blades are butted against  the rim's flange in set up relation.  the bead breaker blades are  swingably connected to a power unit (39) for moving the  blades between storage and use positions.  the bead breaker  mechanism (10) and power unit (39) are structured so that, in  use, the bead breaker blades are drawn from the set up posiÂ­ tion toward the rim's center plane in a generally linear and  radially inward directed fashion without the blades being  latched to the tire's rim and without contact of the blades with  the rim.  at maximum extension of the bead breaker blades by  the power unit, the working faces of the blades are entirely  located radially inward of the rim's flange (17).
