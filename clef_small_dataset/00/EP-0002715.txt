<ABSTRACT>
neutron absorbing articles, such as those in plate  form suitable for use in a storage rack for spent nuclear  fuel and having such properties as to make them useful in  such application for long periods of time, are made by an  improved one-step curing method in which a mixture of  boron carbide particles, powdered phenolic resin and a  minor proportion of a liquid medium which boils at a temperature  below 200Â°c, preferably water, is compacted to  desired article form and is cured at an elevated temperature,  without simultaneous imposition of pressure in compacting  or pressing means, so as to cause bonding of the irreversibly  cured phenolic polymer resulting to the boron carbide particles  and production of the neutron absorber in desired  form.  the described method is also employable when a  proportion of the boron carbide particles, e. g.     / 10 to  9 / 10,  is replaced by a diluent compound.
