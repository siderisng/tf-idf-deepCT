<ABSTRACT>
a low-inertia scanning system for projecting an image of  a stationary object (31) on a flat platen (10) onto a rotating  photoreceptor drum (16).  an aperture plate (14) located  adjacent the photoreceptor drum (16) moves in a direction  opposite the direction of rotation of the drum.  a carriage (22)  disposed between a stationary lens (12) and the photorecep­ tor drum (16) supports a pair of mirrors (24,26).  the light  image is projected from the lens (12) to one (24) of the pair of  mirrors (24,26) for reflection to the second mirror (26)  rotating about a pivot point (30) to scan the image through  the aperture (15) onto the photoreceptor drum (16).  during  scanning of the platen (10), the carriage (22) moves in a  linear direction towards and away from the photoreceptor  drum (16) and, together with the rotation of the second  mirror (26), maintains a constant magnification ratio.  a  second pair of mirrors (18,19) disposed between the platen  (10) and the lens (12) is adapted for movement in a linear  direction with respect to the flat platen (10) to predetermined  positions in cooperation with the shifting of the lens (12) to  provide a properly-focused light image in a different magnifi­ cation range.
