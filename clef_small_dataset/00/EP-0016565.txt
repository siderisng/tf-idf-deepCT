<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to novel heterocyclic derivatives having action on histamine receptors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutics. certain novel heirocyclic derivatives have now been found which have potent activity as h2 -antagonists. these compounds, which are more particularly described below, for example show inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid when this is stimulated via histamine receptors (ash and schild,brit.j.pharmacol. chemother, 1966, 27, 427). their ability to do so can be demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach using the method described in german offenlegungsschrift no.2,734,070, modified by the use of sodium pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg) as anaesthetic instead of urethane, and in conscious dogs equipped with heidenhain pouches using the method described by black et al, nature 1972 236, 385. furthermore the compounds antagonise the effect of histamine on the contraction frequency of isolated guinea pig right atrium but do not modify histamine induced contractions of isolated gastrointestinal smooth muscle which are mediated via h1 -receptors. certain compounds according to the invention have the advantage of an extended duration of action. compounds with histamine h2 -blocking activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity, particularly in gastric and peptic ulceration, as a prophylactic measure in surgical procedures, and in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a known mediator, thus they may be used for example, either alone or in combination with other active ingredients in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin. the present invention provides compounds of the emi2.1 and physiologically acceptable salts, hydrates and bioprecursors thereof, in which r1 and r2 which may the same or different, each represent hydrogen, c1-10 alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, trifluoroalkyl, or alkyl substituted by hydroxy, alkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkyiamino or cycloalkyl or r1 and r2 may together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5 to 10 membered ring which may be saturated or may contain at least one double bond, may be unsubstituted or may be substituted by one or more c13 alkyl groups, e.g. methyl or a hydroxy group and/or may contain another heteroatom, e.g. oxygen or sulphur; alk represents a straight or branched alkylene chain of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, q represents a furan or thiophen ring in which incorporation into the rest of the molecule is through bonds at the 2- and 5- positions, the furan ring optionally bearing a further substituent r6 adjacent to the group rlr2n-alk-, or q represents a benzene ring. in which incorporation into the rest of the molecule is through bonds at the 1- and 3- or 1- and 4- positions; r6 represents halogen or c14 alkyl which may be substituted by hydroxy or c 1-4 alkoxy; x represents -ch2-, emi3.1 where r5 represents hydrogen or methyl; n represents zero, 1 or 2; m represents 2,3 or 4; r3 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl,
