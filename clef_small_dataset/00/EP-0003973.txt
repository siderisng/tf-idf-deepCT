<ABSTRACT>
A low voltage circuit breaker (1) has an insulating housing (2), which is divided into a top (4) and a lower part (5) along a partial carrier (3). In the housing (2), an electromagnetic trigger (22) is arranged, which comprises a fixed magnetic yoke (26) and a movably arranged armature (27). The armature (27) is mounted with bearing pin (41) of rectangular cross-section in bearing openings (35) formed as a pocket-like recesses of the wall surfaces of the lower part (5) which define the polares of the circuit breaker (1). The bearing surface of the bearing openings (35) associated with a narrow surface of each bearing journal may be composed of two angularly connected teeth (43, 44), such that a cutting-edge bearing results. For fixing the magnetic yoke (26) on the lower part (5) of the housing (2) is provided on the distance of wall surfaces arranged island-type projection (60) against which the middle part of the magnetic yoke (26) is applied by a spring element (64) . In addition, a protrusion (65) of a conductor (66) serves as a position protection of the magnetic yoke (26).
