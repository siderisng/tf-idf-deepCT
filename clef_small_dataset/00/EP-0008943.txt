<ABSTRACT>
the novel filter, according to an embodiment thereof,  comprises a filter matrix formed into a specific geometry and  made of glass, metal, mineral and/or cellulostic fibers, or  fibers or fiber-agglomerates moulded from thermoplastic,  thermoset plastic, elastoplasts, or related synthetic polymer  materials, which have been coated, impregnated, or com­ pounded, prior to forming, with a series of substances in  order that the filter may be easily cleaned and reused, as well  as protected against corrosive action by the fluid media, or to  render substances in the filtration fluid media chemically  unreactive, or to change the chemical state or structure of  matter in the fluid media.  the coating compounds, filler  compounds, or impregnants, depending upon which thereof  are employed, change the physical properties of the filter  matrix and alters impaction-retention of filtered particles,  and/or alters the electrostatic attraction of the matrix for  matter in the fluid media, and/or imparts corrosion protec­ tion to the filter matrix, and or renders matter in the fluid  media chemically unreactive by changing its reactivity  characteristics or chemical structure upon contact with the  matrix.
