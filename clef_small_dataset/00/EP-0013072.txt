<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to alkoxylated amine compounds  having the formula:    where r₁ and r₂, which may be the same or different, are  selected from hydrogen and alkyl groups containing 8 to 24  carbon atoms with the proviso that r₁ and r₂ are not both  hydrogen, and where r₃ and r₄, which may be the same or  different, are selected from hyorogen or lower alkyl groups  containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms.  in preferred embodiments r₃  and r are both hydrogen and   (1) one of r₁ and r₂ is hydrogen and the other is a c₁₃ or c₁₅  long chain alkyl group; or   (2) both of r₁ and r₂ are c₁₃ or c₁₅ long chain alkyl groups.  the alkoxylated amine compounds are conveniently pre­ pared by reaction of the corresponding aldehyde    with a monoalkanolamine nh₂.  (cr₃r₄)2 .  oh and the com­ pounds may be used for example as chemical intermediates  or as bitumen adhesion agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
long chain amine derivatives this invention relates to alkoxylated amines, to compositions based on these amines and to the manufacl and use of these amines and compositions. compositions based on long chain amines and their derivatives have been proposed for a wide variety of uses7 for example as fabric softening agents and as emulsifiers. however, such prior art compositions have not always been entirely satisfactory, for example because their degree of effectiveness is less than might be desired or because they are difficult to handle. we have now surprisingly found that certain long chain amine derivatives and compositions based on them have some advantageous properties and a wide variety of uses. accordingly, the present invention comprises alkoxylated amine compounds having the formula: emi1.1 where r1 and r2, which may be the same or different, are selected from hydrogen and alkyl groups containing 8 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms, with the proviso that r1 and r2 are not both hydrogen, and where r3 and r4, which may be the same or different, are selected from hydrogen or lower alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. r3 and r4 are preferably hydrogen or methyl groups. in a preferred embodiment of this invention the substituents r1 and r2 are both long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the groups being both straight chain and branched, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 70%, and r3 and r4 are both hydrogen. more preferably, the substituents r1 and r2 comprise long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms comprising approximately 65 to 7596 c13 groups with approximately 35 to 2546 c15 groups (these percentages being calculated on the total of long chain alkyl groups) with approximately 40 to 55 wt 46 straight chain and 60 to 4546 2-alkyl branched chain where the 2-alkyl group is predominantly methyl. the derivative of this preferred embodiment is hereinafter referred to as "synprolam" (registered trade mark) d35x1. in another preferred embodiment of this invention, one of the substituents r1 and r2 is hydrogen and the other is selected from long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the groups being both straight chain and branched, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 7046, and r3 and r4 are both hydrogen. more preferably, the substituent r1 or r2 which is not hydrogen comprises long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms comprising approximately 65 to 75,' c13 groups with approximately 35 to 2596 c15 groups (these perntages being calculated on the total of long chain alkyl groups) with approximately 40 to 55 wt ,' straight chain and 60 to 45,' 2-alkyl branched chain where the 2-alkyl group is predominantly methyl. the derivative of this preferred embodiment is hereinafter referred to as "synprolam" (registered trade mark) 35x1. alkoxylated amine compounds according to this invention are conveniently prepared by the reaction of an aldehyde of formula emi2.1 and a monoalkanolamine nh2
