<ABSTRACT>
The brake linkage adjusting device provided for vehicle brakes, in particular rail ride brakes has two to each other telescopically ver actuated linkage parts 1 and 15 for transmitting de brake force. A connecting device between the linkage parts 1 and 15 comprises a threaded spindle 11 and at least one nut 13 screwed with this via a non-self-dominated thread 12, wherein one of the screwed parts (nut 13) and smoothable and the other screwing part (threaded spindle 11) rotatably mounted, ver rati A switchable by axial displacement of this sealable bunging part switchable in the closing direction of a spring 20 rotary coupling 9 with a rotary busy part Kup is pelbar. In the opening direction of the rotary coupling 9 acting on the rotatable screwing part (11) according to a target stroke with a control stop device couplable, which has at least one spring member 29, 30 and a transmission lever 25 in the force connection from a reference part 36 to the screwing part (11). The translation lever 25 oversters the force transmitted by the spring member 29, 30 to the rotatable screwing member (11), the spring member 29, 30 is correspondingly weakly impressable and therefore takes only a small proportion of the braking force to be transmitted after overcoming the target stroke. The brake linkage adjusting device can be formed with outer or internal translation lever and / or spring member as well as a separate brake linkage part or as a brake cylinder incorporated organ.
