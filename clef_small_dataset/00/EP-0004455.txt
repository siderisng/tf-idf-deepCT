<ABSTRACT>
a selectively collapsible and expandable insulating  curtain and the method of making same, the curtain having  a plurality of collapsible tubes, preferably of plastic material,  extending longitudinally for its width and superimposed  one on top of the other in a row in the direction of curtain  height.  each tube has an upper wall and a lower wall  secured together by bands of adhering contact on opposite  sides of the tubular cavity.  additional bands of adhering  contact secure superimposed tubes to each other longitudinally  along midsections of the upper and lower walls.   the side bands of contact define fold lines allowing collapse  and expansion of the tubes as the curtain is raised  and lowered, respectively, in the manner of a venetian  blind.  the curtain may include additional rows of superimposed  tubes one adjacent to the other in the direction of  curtain thickness.  in making the curtain, a plurality of thinfilm  strips are wound about the periphery of a forming  member with bands of adhering material interlaminated  between adjacent strips, the width of the midsection bands  corresponding to the desired width of the expanded tubes  and bands between successive adjoining layers being in a  staggered relationship.  after winding is complete, the  superimposed strips are cut transversely, removed from  the forming member and straightened to form the curtain.   the number of spaced bands may be such that the strips  may also be cut longitudinally to provide a plurality of curtains.   after straightening, means may be secured to the  tubular structure for hanging and selectively collapsing  and expanding the curtain.
