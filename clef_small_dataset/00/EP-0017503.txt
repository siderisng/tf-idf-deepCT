<DESCRIPTION>
gem-bis (hdroxymethyl) alcohols and mixtures thereof with diols, process for their preparation involving the preparation of formyl alcohols, of hydroxymethyl formyl alcohols and of diols and a process for the preparation of polyurethanes therefrom. this invention relates to products and processes useful in the manufacture of synthetic resins. hydroformylation is basically defined as the addition of a formal qroup through the reaction of an unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. the basic technolbgy for the manufacture of hydroformyl ated products and consequently their derivatives is amply set out hereinafter. among the difficulties which must be met in the manufacture of hydroformylated products is the consideration that hydrogen gas, an explosive, and carbon monoxide, a hazardous material, are utilized in the process. hydroformylation processes are also dependent on expensive metallic catalysts such as carbonyls which have high toxicity and high cost. the conditions for running a hydroformylation reaction also involve the use of substantial temperature and pressure thus necessitating costly equipment which must be maintained. thus due to the various factors and considerations which go into the manufacture of hydroformylated products and their derivatives it is essential that the reactions individually and cummulatively give high purity of the desired end product and high yield thereby avoiding excessive handling of hazardous materials while minimizing the high capital cost and maintenance of such production facilities. in the past several attempts have been made to prepare hydroformylated products or similar materials such as is described in united states patent 2,43,6oo to gresham et al issued march 9, 1948. the gresham patent relates to the synthesis of organic oxygen containing compounds, in particular aldehydes. united states patent 2,533,276 to mckeever et al issued december 12, 1950 describes ester-acetals obtained with cobalt catalysts. united states patent 2,599,468 to mckeever issued june 3, 1952 describes the process of preparing nonadecyl glycols. united states patent 3,040,090 issued june12, 1962 to alderson et al discusses the reaction of hydrocarbons with aldehydes and higher alcohols in methanol to prepare organic oxy compounds. the alderson et al patent sets forth a number of metallic catalysts which may be employed in effecting the reactions described therein. in united states patent, 3-,043,871 issued july 10, 1962 to buchner et al the production of heptadecanedicarboxylic acid is described. foreman et al in united states patent 3,227,640 issued january 4, 1966 describes the production of olefinically unsaturated alcohols which are of use in manufacturing some of the end products of the present invention. united states patent 3,420,898 issued to van winkle et al on january 7, 1969 discusses the use of cobalt complexes with certain phosphine compounds in the production of primary alcohols with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. united states patent 3,530,190 issued september 22, 1970 to olivierdiscusses hydrocarbonylation of olefins-using certain metal salts. the foregoing reference also discusses the recovery of the complexed metal catalyst. in a patent to ramsden issued january 16, 1973 as united states patent 3,711,560, the production of polyolefins and other oxygenated organic compounds which are polyunsaturated is discussed.
