<ABSTRACT>
a coaxial plug connector for use as an insert in a first  connector housing comprises a first generally cylindrical  outer shell (12), a socket (14) centered on the axis of the  shell and a sleeve of electrically insulating material between  the socket and the shell.  the forward end of the insulating  sleeve projects beyond the forward end of the socket and  has peripheral regions defining a first male frustoconical  or other convex face (20), it is used in combination with a  coaxial receptacle connector for use as an insert in a second  connector housing and has a second generally cylindrical  outer shell (36) dimensioned to mate with the first outer  shell, a contact pin (38) centered on the axis of the second  shell and an insulating sleeve (30) whose forward end is  recessed behind the forward end of the contact pin and has  regions (44, 46) defining complementary frustoconical faces  to those at the forward end of the plug connector.  in use  the convex face of the plug connector assists in eliminating  misalignment between the plug and receptacle during  mating of the first and second connector housings.

<DESCRIPTION>
plug and receptacle connectors the present invention relates to coaxial plug and receptacle connectors for electrical cables carrying an alternating electrical current and more particularly with connectors for use with two-part connector housings, one half of which makes edge connection with a removable printed circuit board and the other half of which is connected to the main frame into which the board is connected. such connector housings are generally rectangular and may have a number of connector pins received in respective sockets in the mating half for carrying direct or low frequency alternatinq'current and also one or more coaxial plug or receptacle inserts to which a coaxial electrical cable may be connected for carrying higher frequency alternating current. similarly the invention may be applied to plug and receptacle inserts for multi-way circular connectors. a problem associated with previously known two-part connectors is that of accurately aligning the plugs and the receptacles in each half so that they may be pushed smoothly together. an object of the invention is to provide a plug and receptacle for fitting into the parts of the housing which cooperate to bring about progressive alignment as the parts of the connector housing are mated together. in one aspect the invention provides a coaxial plug connector comprising a first generally cylindrical outer shell, a socket centered on the axls of the shell, and a sleeve of electrically insulating material between the socket and the shell, the forward end of the insulating sleeve projecting beyond the forward end of the socket and having peripheral regions defining a first male frustoconical or other convex face. the invention also provides a coaxial plug and receptacle connector comprising a coaxial plug connector as aforesaid in corbination with a socket connector having a second generally cylindrical outer shell dimensione√† to mate with the first outer shell, a contact pin centered on the axis of the second shell and an insulating sleeve whose forward end is recessed behind the forward end of the contact pin and has regions defining compleirtentary frustoconical faces to those at the forward end of the plug connector. the invention also provides a two-part multi-pin connector comprising a ,mating male connector housing and female connector housing, each having a plurality of axial bores in which are disposed respective receptacle inserts as defined above and plug inserts as defined above. other preferred aspects of the invention will be found in the appended claims, to which attention is hereby directed. an embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accoinpanying drawings, in which: figure 1 shows the forward end of a coaxial plug connector and a coaxial socket connector in axis is- aligned position with bores in respective ale and female connector housings; figures 2 to 6 show successive stages in the rating of the connectors shown in figure 1. a plug connector generally indicated by the reference numeral 10 has a generally cylindrical metal outer shell 12, a socket 14 centered on
