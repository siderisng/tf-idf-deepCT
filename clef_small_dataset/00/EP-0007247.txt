<ABSTRACT>
a process for the catalytic gasification of carbonaceous  materials is performed in the presence of a catalyst compris­ ing an added potassium salt of an acid having an ionization  constant exceeding 10⁻³, which salt has relatively poor cataly­ tic activity (compared to the activity of potassium carbonate)  and a sodium or lithium compound.  the sodium or lithium  compound is either a salt of a weak acid having an ionization  constant of less than 10⁻³ or a salt of a strong acid that is  converted (temporarily or permanently) to a salt of a weak  acid having an ionization constant less than 10⁻³, under the  condition of the gasification reactions.  high gasification  rates may thus be achieved employing catalyst materials  which are relatively cheaper than potassium carbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
a process for the catalytic gasification of carbonaceous materials the present invention relates to a process for the catalytic gasification of carbonaceous materials such as oils, petroleum residua, coals and the like, and is particularly concerned with the catalytic gasification operations carried out in the presence of alkali metalcontaining catalysts. it has long been recognised that certain alkali metal compounds can be employed to catalyze the gasification of carbonaceous materials such as coal and other carbonaceous solids. studies have shown that potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate and lithium carbonate will substantially accelerate the rate at which steam, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and the like react with bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite, petroleum coke, organic waste materials and similar carbonaceous solids to form methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and other gaseous products. other alkali metal salts such as alkali metal chlorides, however, have a low catalytic activity when compared to that of the corresponding carbonate. because of the relatively high cost of cesium carbonate and the low effectiveness of lithium and sodium carbonates, most of the experimental work in this area which has been carried out in the past has been directed toward the use of potassium carbonate. in addition to utilizing individual alkali metal salts as a catalyst for the gasification of a carbonaceous material, it has been proposed to utilize mixtures of alkali petal salts. when such mixtures of alkali metal salts are used to promote the gasification of a carbonaceous feed material, it is expected that the mixture will accelerate the gasification reactions less than if an equivalent amount of the more active alkali metal compound is used alone and more than if an equivalent amount of the less active alkali metal salt is employed. in gasification processes using alkali metal-containing catalysts, the cost of the catalyst is a significant factor in determing the overall cost of the product gas. potassium carbonate is relatively expensive. the costs of other alkali metal compounds such as potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate are substantially cheaper than potassium carbonate but these compounds exhibit only a fraction of the catalytic activity exhibited by potassium carbonate. it would be highly desirable if- the compounds mentioned above and other more abundant, less expensive potassium and sodium compounds could be effectively used as gasification catalysts thereby substantially decreasing the initial investment required in the catalyst and obviating the need for expensive secondary recovery techniques to decrease the amount of makeup alkali compounds that would otherwise be required to maintain the catalyst inventory at the required level. summary of the invention the present invention provides an improved process for the catalytic gasification of a carbonaceous feed material. in accordance with the invention, it has now been found that catalyst costs incurred during the gasification of oils, petroleum residua, bituminous coa±, subbituminous coal, lignite, organic waste material, petroleum coke, and other carbonaceous feed materials can be significantly reduced while at the same time obtaining unexpectedly high gasification rates by employing
