<ABSTRACT>
By pointwise scanning and comparison with a template, the differences of the samples are formed corresponded to the corrulsive pixels of testing and template. The difference values ​​are subjected to a tint correction, then a weighting process and a minimum threshold correction. In the case of the tint correction, each Difference value is deducted from the difference values ​​in a determined environmental area of ​​the relevant pixel Bii determined average. The weighting process takes place individually for each pixel and causes systematic fault and critical image zones to fail to fail. The weight factors are determined by statistical analysis by visual testing for well-found test specimens. In the minimum threshold correction, all those pretreated difference values ​​are divorced, which lie below a certain minimum threshold. To the remaining difference values ​​of each pixel, the difference values ​​of the resulting points are added algebraically with distance-dependent weighting. The values ​​thus obtained are compared with a threshold for each pixel. If these values ​​in at least one pixel exceed the threshold value, the test object is assessed as faulty.
