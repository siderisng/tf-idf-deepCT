<ABSTRACT>
a gaseous fuel burner for enhanced flame adherence to  a tile surface in a furnace, comprising a gas burner tube  having a nozzle at its end, including a plurality of radial  orifices circumferentially spaced in a transverse plane.  a  cylindrical combustion air plenum is coaxial with said burner  tube, and means are provided to supply combustion air to  said plenum at a selected super-atmospheric pressure p1.   there is a circular concentric opening in the wall of the  plenum and a short length of air tube welded to the opening,  which is inserted into an opening in the furnace tile.  a plurality  of curved vanes are provided, and means to lead air from  the pressurized plenum through the vanes to provide a  rapidly spinning air flow which moves helically along the air  tube into the tile and into the furnace.  the central opening of  the tile is flared in an arcuate manner.  there is sufficient  pressure drop between the air plenum at p1 and inside of the  air tube p2, after passage through the vanes, of the order of  0. 8 w. c.  so that a tangential air velocity of as high as 100 feet  per second is possible.  this rapidly spinning air volume has  fuel injected into it under pressure through the radial orifices,  and flows into the furnace in an expanding spiral flow along  the arcuate portion of the tile.  because of the high tangential  velocity of the air, gas and flame, the pressure at the face of  the tile is low and the flame is held in close contact with the  tile causing rapid heat transfer to the tile which then radiates  into the furnace area.
