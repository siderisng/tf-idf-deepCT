<ABSTRACT>
an optical system having a spherical mirror (34) is used  to collect light from the surface of a turbine blade (14) or the  like which is to be contoured.  the spherical mirror (34) is  located at an equal optical distance from both the test  specimen and the linear diode array (36) so that it operates at  a one-to-one magnification ratio.  the linear diode array (36)  is positioned behind the spherical mirror (34) and it receives  light focused by the mirror and reflected by a beam splitter  (32) through an opening (38) in the center of the mirror.  none  of the optical elements of the inspection system are located  in the plane of movement of the test specimen so that even  particularly long items such as a helicopter rotor blade can  be contoured.  identical upper and lower optical systems  allow both surfaces of the test specimen to be contoured  simultaneously and each system is independently operable  and oriented to prevent optical interference.  an automatic  gain control (40, 31, 42) is provided to adjust the optical  modulator (22) so that the effective intensity of the spot  presented to the diode array is maintained within predetermined  limits.
