<ABSTRACT>
soap bars, which contain at least about 1% potassium  soap and 0. 15% chloride anions, and which additionally  comprise water and a selected sodium potassium or  ammonium salt electrolyte, particularly potassium carbonate,  dipotassium monohydrogen orthophospate, tetrapotassium  pyrophosphate, potassium tripolyphosphate, tripotassium  orthophosphate, or sodium and/or potassium formates,  citrates, tartrates, or acetates, are disclosed.  these soap bars  do not form undesirable crystals, either on their surfaces or  internally, after periods of use or storage and, additionally,  exhibit improved lathering performance and decreased scum  formation.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
soap bars background of the invention a wide variety of soap bars and methods of making such soaps are known in the art. many soap-making processes, such as those described in u.s. patent 2,686,761, ferguson et al., issued august 17, 1954, and u.s. patent 2,970,116, kelly et al., issued january 31, 1961, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, utilize electrolytes, such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, as processing aids. thus, such soaps frequently contain significant amounts of chloride anions. in addition, it has been found to be advantageous to utilize potassium soaps as, at least, a portion of soap compositions; this is especially true where the soap to be manufactured is transparent, since the presence of the potassium soap enhances transparency. it has been found, however, that the presence of significant levels of both potassium soap and chloride anions in a soap bar leads to the formation of crystals on the surface or the interior of the bar, after use or storage, particularly under hot and humid conditions. such crystals detract from the appearance and consumer desirability of these soaps. it has now been discovered that by utilizing specific electrolytes in such soap bars this crystallization problem can be eliminated, while endowing the soaps with additional performance advantages. it is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a soap bar, especially a transparent soap-bar, containing significant levels of potassium soap and chloride anions, which does not form crystals upon use or storage. it is a further object of this invention to provide a soap bar which exhibits better lather and decreased scum formation properties than similar bars made with conventional electrolytes. it is a still further object of this invention to provide a transparent soap bar which has better transparency characteristics than similar soaps made with conventional electrolytes. description of the invention the present invention is a soap bar which does not form undesirable crystals upon use or storage, and which contains at least about 1% potassium soap and at least about 0.15% chloride anions, ocoprising from about 4% to about 25% moisture and from about 0.2% to about 5%, preferably fran about 0.5% to about 3%, of an electrolyte selected from the group consisting of potassium carbonate, dipotassium monohydrogen orthophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, potassium tripolyphosphate, tripotassium orthophosphate, sodium formate, potassium formate, potassium tartrate, sodium tartrate, potassium citrate, sodium citrate, potassium acetate, sodium acetate, potassium ammonium tartrate, ammonium acetate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium formate, ammonium citrate, ammonium lactate, ammonium bisulfate, and mixtures thereof. preferred compositions contain electrolytes selected from potassium carbonate, dipotassium monohydrogen orthophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, potassium tripolyphosphate, tripotassium orthophosphate, and mixtures thereof. another preferred group of electrolytes includes sodium and/or potassium formates, citrates, acetates, and tartrates. in a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the soap bar is made from a transparent soap. as used herein, percentages, ratios and parts are "by weight" and are based on the composition of the finished soap, unless otherwise stated. the soap bars of the present invention are comprised
