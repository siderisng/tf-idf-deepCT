<ABSTRACT>
1.  resilient coupling, with two identical toothed wheels (84, 82), which are arranged on shaft ends and whose rows of teeth lie in side by side juxtaposition, also with a ring gear (internally toothed ring), which axially overlaps both toothed wheels (84, 82) and whose coupling teeth (48) have the same angular spacing as the teeth of the toothed wheels (84, 82) and engage in the tooth gaps of the toothed wheels, characterised in that there is provided separate resilient means (120, 30, 156), which radially resiliently press the coupling teeth (48) and/or the teeth (46, 74) of the toothed wheels (84, 82) into the opposite lying toothed gaps associated with them, the tooth flanks (116, 118, 146, 148) sliding on one another when the load alters.
