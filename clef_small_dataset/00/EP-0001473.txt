<ABSTRACT>
herbicidal pyridine compounds of the formula    wherein z and y each represent a fluorine, chlorine, bromine,  iodidine, or hydrogen atom, or a trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl,  or chlorodifluoromethyl radical, provided  that at least one of z and y is a halogenomethyl radical;  r¹ represents hydrogen or an alkyl radical of 1 to 4 carbon  atoms; and r² is a cyano group; a carboxyl group; one of  a specified range of carboxamide or alkoxycarbonyl groups;  a cyclohexyloxycarbonyl radical optionally substituted by  one or more halogen atoms or methyl radicals; an alkenyloxycarbonyl  radical in which the alkenyl group contains  from 3 to 6 carbon atoms; a phenoxycarbonyl radical optionally  bearing one or more halogen or methyl substituents;  or a benzyloxycarbonyl radical, the phenyl group of which  optionally bears one or more halogen or methyl substituents;  and, in the case of compounds wherein r² is a  carboxyl group, salts thereof.  the compounds are useful  as selective herbicides for grass weeds in broad-leaved  crops, intermediates of formula    with y = hydrogen or chlorine.
