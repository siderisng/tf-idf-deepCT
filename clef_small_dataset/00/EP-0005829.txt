<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the manufacture of aqueous wax emulsions having a content of a salt or a quaternization product of a long chain fatty amine as cationic, biocidally effective substance, which comprises preparing separately an anionically emulsified wax emulsion with a wax proportion of from 5 to 40% by weight and an aqueous solution of the biocidally active compound, adding to one or both components an oxethylation product prepared by reacting a fatty alcohol having from 8 to 34 carbon atoms and/or an alkyl phenol having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms with 6 to 50 mols of ethylene oxide, and then mixing the wax emulsion with the solution of the active substance in a proportion such that 100 parts by weight of the finished product contain 1 to 20 parts by weight of wax, 1 to 10 parts by weight of biocidally active substance and 1 to 10 parts by weight of oxethylation product.
