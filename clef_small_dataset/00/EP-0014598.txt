<ABSTRACT>
a method of and apparatus for removing material from  the surface of produce such as fruit and vegetables employs a  rotating cage (4) defined by an annular array of rotatable  rollers (6) provided with surfaces to remove such material and  arranged vertically.  in order to control the residence time of  produce as it falls by gravity through the cage, and is cen­ trifugally urged into contact with the rollers (6), there is pro­ vided a member to control residence time, this generally  being a continuous or brush type auger (20) although in some  embodiments residence is controlled by means of the rollers  offering upwardly facing surfaces to resistance gravitational  downward motion of produce.

<DESCRIPTION>
description method of and apparatus for continuous surface treatment of produce this invention relates to a method of and apparatus for continuous surface treatment of produce, that is to say the cleaning and/or peeling of fruits and vegetables, in particular but not exclusively potatoes. a high processing rate with -minimal waste and handling damage is important in the food processing industries, but attempts to accomplish this have presented difficult problems due to many factors, including the highly irregular surfaces of certain produce, such as potatoes, the substantial variation in optimum abrasive surface pressure, the susceptibility of some produce to handling damage, differences,in epidermis characteristics of different produce types and different species of the same type, the ever increasing difficulties in disposing of waste wash water and treating chemicals and the recent substantial increase in the cost of energy for producing steam, hot water or radiant heat for certain related operations. while united states patents nos. 3,134,413; 3,566,942 and 3,946,658 disclosed devices which relied upon tumbling produce in a generally horizontal rotating cage constructed of rotating abrasive spindles, a new concept was presented in united states patents nos. 4,062,985 and 4,068,574 wherein the peeling cage accelerated the produce to a rotary speed sufficient to maintain it centrifugally contacting against the spindle abrading surfaces. this greatly improved the potential cleaning and/or peeling efficiency and allowed control of produce pressure varying the cage speed, further, the new arrangement reduced the likelihood of produce damage by substantially decreasing tumbling. however, some difficulty has been experienced in accurately controlling the residence time of the produce within the cage, while it was also recognized that variations in the abrasive surface of the cage spindles were desirable for optimum utilization of the produce treating arrangement. in one aspect the present invention provides apparatus for removing material from the surface of produce and separating the removed material from the resultant mixture of produce and removed material, said apparatus comprising a rotatable drum-like cage with a vertical axis through which the produce is fed, the periphery of the cage being defined at least in part by a plurality of rollers disposed in an annular array and having surfaces adapted to remove material from the surface of the produce and drive means for - rotating the cage as a whole and the rollers of the cage,characterised by a residence control member provided within the cage, said member having an upper surface to resist and control the downward movement of produce being treated through the cage and increase the residence time of produce in the cage. in another aspect the present invention provides a method of removing material from the surface of produce and separating the removed material from the resultant mixture of produce and removed material including the steps of urging said produce centrifugally into engagement with rollers disposed in an annular vertical array having surfaces adapted to remove material from the produce surfaces, and rotating the rollers independent of rotation of the array, characterised by the step of resisting
