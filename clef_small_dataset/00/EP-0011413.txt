<ABSTRACT>
a push button switch comprises a pair of fixed contact  members (2,3: 21, 22) which are bridged in the closed condi­ tion of the switch by a movable contact member (4; 23) that is  biased towards engagement with the fixed contact members  (2,3; 21, 22) by means of a spring or the like (5; 24).  breaking of  the electrical pathway through the switch is achieved by actu­ ation of a plunger (9; 26) which is arranged to bear on the  movable contact members (4; 23) so as to pivot it relative to a  predetermined one (3; 21) of the fixed contact members at  least during the initial travel of the plunger during actuation  thereof and so that making and breaking of the electrical  pathway through the switch occurs between the other fixed  contact member (2; 22) and the movable contact member (4;  23).  only one pair of contacts (6, 8; 29, 30) need be made from  fine silver.  forms of switch are illustrated with an essentially  planar movable contact member (4) and an asymmetric  plunger (9) formed with a nib (13), as well as forms of switch  with an l- or 7-shaped movable contact member (23).  one of  the fixed contact members (21) can have a lip (35).

<DESCRIPTION>
switch this invention relates to a switch, more particularly to a switch of the push button type. it is known to construct a push button switch having two fixed contact members and a movable contact member biased towards the fixed contacts by means of a spring. in such a switch the fixed contact members comprise aligned portions of conductive material which provide the fixed contacts and the movable contact member takes the form of a generally planar conductive bridge member which provides an electrical pathway between the fixed contacts in the closed condition of the switch. to break this electrical pathway the plunger of the push button, which is slidably mounted between the fixed contact members so as to be movable in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of the fixed contacts, is depressed so as to bear against the movable contact member and move it bodily away from the fixed contacts. in practice it is found that, due to manufacturing tolerances, switches of this type make and break at only one of the fixed contacts. however, it is not possible to predict for a particular sample of switch at which of the two fixed contacts making and breaking of the electrical pathway through the switch will occur. for this reason, if the switch is to be used to carry a reasonably high current, for example a stop lamp switch for a vehicle, it is necessary that the fixed contacts and also the corresponding contacts on the contact member must be made of fine silver - the like o that it matters not at which of the fixe contacts @@@ breaking rt####r'.g or the electrical paty'#ay hrough the switch occurs this factc-r adds significarely to the cost of the manufacture of such a switch, the present invention accordingly seeks to provide a switch of the push button type in which it can be reliably predicted at which of the fixed contacts making and breaking of the electrical pathway through the switch will occur and which can be manufactured for moderately high current density usage significantly more cheaply than the known design by requiring the use of a single set only of fine silver contacts ol te like in place of the two sets of the knovfn design. the invention thus provides a switch cc#rising first and second fixed contact members, a movable contact member for bridging the fixed contacts grlü providing an electrically conductive pathway therebetween in the closed condition of the switch, biasing means for biasing the movable contact member towards engagement witb the fixed contacts members an a plunger aranged bear on #rc- movable contact member so as to pivot it relative to a predetermined one of the fixes contact members at least during the initial travel ci the plunged during actuation thereof art so that making and brsaning at the electrical pa@way through the switch occurs between the other fixed contact member and the movable contact member. since it can be predetermined reliably at which of
