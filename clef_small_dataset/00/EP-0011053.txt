<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method for obtaining a credit  card having an anisotropic uniaxial magnetization and to a  credit card obtained therefrom which can be used as credit  means anywhere it is requested.  the credit card comprises  a substrate of non-magnetic material on any zones of which  ferromagnetic material (5), alloys, such fe-ni-co alloys, are  deposited so that said zones takes on an uniaxial anisotropy  relevant to their hysteresis loops along two orthogonal axes  lying on the substrate plane, due to the application of a  magnetic field tangential to said substrate plane during said  deposition, wherein the ferromagnetic material (5) can be  deposited in thin layers of varying thickness of any form and  dimensions as well as evenly applied to the substrate plane  of the credit card, preferential magnetization directions  being then locally created.
