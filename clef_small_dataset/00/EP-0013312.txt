<ABSTRACT>
1.  an electrical capacitor comprising a capacitor winding or stack, contact bridges, a dielectric which forms expanding gas on the occurrence of an inadmissibly high heating of the capacitor, and a cut-out device which has an electrical conductor which is broken in the case of an excess pressure in the capacitor resulting from a formation of gas and a member applied to the expansible surface of the capacitor, characterised in that, the member (9, 9a) is made resistant to bending and that the electrical conductor (10) is fixed to a contact bridge (4), proceeding from the said fixing is guided around the adjacent end (12; 12a) of the member (9; 9a) and is connected in the region of the said end (12, 12a) to the said member (9; 9a) and to a terminal wire associated therewith.
