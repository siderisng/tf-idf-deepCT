<ABSTRACT>
a method of making a tyre, wherein in partially cured  support element (12) of alastomeric material is provided on a  soluble annular core (14) prior to final curing.  the support  element (12) is built up on the annular core (14) prior to being  partially cured by exposure to a beam of electron radiation.  in one example, apparatus for carrying out the method  comprises a frame (20) with means (18) for supporting and  rotating the soluble annular core (14).  means (22,24) are  provided for wrapping a strip of elastomeric material  helically about the rotating core.  at least one electron  generating device (44) is also provided to direct the beam of  electron radiation onto the wrapped elastomeric material.
