<ABSTRACT>
The invention deals with a device for releasably anchoring a product deposit on the columns of a commodity shelves for goods presentation in retail stores, supermarkets, etc. The device consists of a connecting plate and a support member, wherein from the connecting plate on one side recesses of the column adapted pins, hooks or the like and from the opposite side of at least one bearing part for a rear bearing formed on the support member. In order to prevent dropping of the carrier element connected to the carrier element from the seat on the connecting plate in strong loading of the goods tray, an axially acting blocking device is provided on the connecting plate in the upper region, which extends at least partially in a direction parallel to the surface of the terminal plate and a radially protruding from the carrier element rears. Through these measures, the holder of the goods shelf is safer and the possibility of forming on the device further angularly offset engagement possibilities of the carrier element such that the goods tray can be hung at different angles on the columns.
