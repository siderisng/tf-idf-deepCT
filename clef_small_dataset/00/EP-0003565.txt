<ABSTRACT>
isatin derivative suitable as disperse dyes having the  general formula:    wherein the symbols have the following meanings:   r represents an alkyl group having up to 5 carbon  atoms, a -ch₂-coox group, wherein x stands for an alkyl  group having up to 4 carbon atoms, a    group, or a -ch₂-ch₂-cn group; and r₁ represents a h  atom, a halogen, preferably cl or br, or no₂;   and the preparation thereof are described.  the disperse dyes of the invention are particularly  suited for the dyeing and printing of synthetic fibres, such  as polyester fibres, in shades from yellow-green to orange.   the dyes are obtained by condensation of 2-benzimidazolyl-acetonitrile  with the corresponding isatinic derivative.
