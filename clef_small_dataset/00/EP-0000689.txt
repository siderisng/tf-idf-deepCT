<ABSTRACT>
With an apparatus for monitoring the humidity and color equilibrium in offset printing plants, the liquid film thickness is measured on a measuring roller (14) which is arranged between the last wet (11) and the first color application roller (12).The measuring roller (14) is at least partially hydrophilic.Depending on the measuring method applied, the measuring roller is constantly at the adjacent order rollers (11, 12) or it is applied to the wet (11) and to the ink application rollers (12) in the change to the wet (11).With the aid of a light source (16), a measuring photo receiver (18), a comparative photo sensor (19) as well as a filter (20 or 24) in the measuring and comparison beam path, the liquid layer present on the measuring roller (14) can be used to determine the humidityand color equilibrium on the plate.
