<ABSTRACT>
in order to make possible individual dosing of materials in the form of powder or grains in the domestic field, an overall arrangement consisting of a number of separating discs is proposed.  two separating discs (14, 20), of which one (14) is rotatable, form by means of vertical walls (18, 22) the dosing chamber, and a disc, one arranged above (25) and one below (5) this dosing chamber and each having a flowthrough opening, closes or opens the dosing chamber to the storage chamber or the dispensing side respectively.  on rotation, these two discs (5, 25) are forcibly interconnected and have openings which are offest in relation to one another.  <image>
