<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a pre-sion sensor of the type comprising a piezoelectric substrate (1), one of which is polished and carries two delay lines (2, 3) using interdigitated combs belonging to two oscillators whose output signals are mixed. . The sensor comprises a hood (9, 19) in two by ties communicating with a manometric connector (10), a piezoelectric plate (1) attached in its edges on a support, the assembly forming a sealing partison vis-Ã -vis the Fluid contained in the fitting, it exerts pressure on the non-polished side of the wafer. A printed circuit (13) carrying the necessary electronic circuits and connected to the delay lines (2, 3) is introduced between the two parts of the cover (9, 19). Protective means may be provided to prevent the contact of the polished face with polluted air, while maintaining a hard pressure on this face. The invention applies in particular to the control of the advance of the ignition of a motor motor.
