<ABSTRACT>
a video player/reeorder receives video information on  line 12 to be recorded on a disk 28 or reproduced from the disk  28 for display on a television set 46.  prior to recording, the  information is compressed in compactor 20 and following  reproduction, the information is decompressed in decompac­ ter 35.  the information is prepared for compression by means  of an arithmetic unit 17 and is processed following decom­ pression by the same unit 17.  the unit 17 performs a hadamard transform on the video  data and achieves the necessary high processing rate by  means of two adders and two subtractors operating in paral­ lel.  a store 16 that holds the data during successive passes  through the arithmetic unit 17 has accessing circuits and a set  of registers and associated gates that fetch and store the data  in a repetitive sequence that simplifles storage accessing.   data is processed in units that represent for example eight  lines of a television picture and are supplied to an output  buffer 41.
