<ABSTRACT>
a latex composition particularly suited as a paint vehicle  for the manufacture of semi-gloss and flat interior paint  compositions comprises from 40 to 70% by weight of  polymerized resin particles having at least 25% (by weight)  vinyl acetate polymerized therein, the particles being sub­ stantially spherical and characterized in that not more than  5% of the particles have a diameter greater than 0. 65 microns  and not more than 5% have a diameter less than 0. 33 mic­ rons.  in the preferred instance, the polymer resin particles  comprise vinyl acetate, a lower alkyl acrylate and a conven­ tional wet adhesion monomer, the combination consisting  (by weight) of from 80 to 90% vinyl acetate, 10 to 20% of  lower alkyl acrylate, e. g. , butyl acrylate and 0. 2 to 1. 5% of wet  adhesion monomer.
