<ABSTRACT>
a housing (10) contains a resiliently mounted electric mo足 tor (32) and compressor (30), which draws air into the housing  through inlets (23) via a tortuous passage (20) formed by  sound absorbent baffles (22), and delivers the air externally of  the housing through outlets (54, 56).  the housing (10) is made  in two halves, each comprising a rigid metal outer layer (14)  and a thermally conductive, sound absorbing inner layer (16),  e. g.  of lead-filled rubber.  silencers (38, 40) are preferably fitted  to the compressor, and may comprise air expansion cham足 bers.  in this way the production of noise is reduced and its es足 cape from the housing is kept low, since the housing does not  need any openings for the through flow of cooling air by con足 vection.
