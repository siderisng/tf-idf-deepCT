<ABSTRACT>
a paneling system for covering walls, ceilings and floors  particularly useful, but not limited to, highly abrasive enviÂ­ ronments such as in blast cabinets wherein workpieces are  subjected to a high velocity stream of abrasive particles for  cleaning or peening the workpieces.  the system is comprised  of two different configurations of plates (a. b. ;c,d. ) each  reversible, preferably made of wear-resistant material, the  plates being particularly conformed to provide for simple and  easy replacement of worn plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
wear plates and wear plate system background ox the invention heretofore, paneling systems have been known wherein panels, or plates, have been affixed to walls, or ceilings, etc., by starting at an edge thereof and progressing across the surface to be panelled until the entire area is covered. because of the close tolerance required in order to have tight joints, and because of tight joints, to remove and replace any of the first few platen such as when it was desired to remove a worn or damaged plate, required the removal of all plates installed after that plate which is to be replaced, an example of prior art plates for paneling systems in blast cabinets is exemplified by u.s. patent no. 3,733,752, granted on may 22, 1973. summary of the invention the present invention relates to a paneling system and, more particularly, to a paneling system wherein wear-resistant plates are assembled in order to protect the wally, ceilings and floors of blast cabinets of the type wherein workpieces are subjected to an abrasive blast stream of abrasive grit and the like. an object of the present invention is to provide a panaling system which includes two different panels or plates1 each being generally flat and having a saries of peripheral edges wherein a series of flange portions are provided for overlapp- ing flange portions of adjacent plates when assembled upon a wall, ceiling, floor, etc more particularly, it is an object of the invention to provide for easy removal and replacement of daged or won plates in a simple and expedient manner by minimizing the number of plates which have to be removed in order to remove the damaged plate. a prime object of the invention is to provide a paneling system comprizing a first plate and a second plate; the first plate being generally flat and having a series of peripheral edges and having a first face and a second face, a series of flange portions, one portion for each edge of the first plate, the flange portions having a thickness less than the thickness oe the first plate and each of the flange portions having a surface coplanar with the first face of the first plate; the second plate being generally flat and having a series of peripheral edges and having a first face and a second face, a series of flange portions, one portion for each edg of the second plate, the flange portions of the second plate having a thickness leas than the thickness of the second plate, a first set of the series of flange portions of the second plate being spaced from each other and each having a surface coplanar with the first face of the second plate, and a second set of the series of flange portions of the second plate being spaced from each other and each having a surface coplanar with the second face of the second plate. a further object of the invention 's to provld- a we resistant plate,
