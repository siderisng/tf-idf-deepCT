<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for making mineral fiber bodies in the form of running lengths, boards or mats, having fibers running, at least generally, vertically to the major faces, in the case of which a number of running lengths, boards or mats made up of fiber are placed one on top of each other with the fibers running generally parallel to the major faces and from this stack plates, made up of single strips, are cut normally with respect to the direction of fiber and are so turned over that their cut faces become the major faces of the mineral fiber bodies, characterized in that the plate (6a), made up of the cut off strips placed one on top of the other is, in each case, sucked on at its end face, tilted out of the plane of cutting and then transported on further.
