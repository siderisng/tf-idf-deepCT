<DESCRIPTION>
esters of substituted 8-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5- tetrahydro-lh-3-benzazepines, process for the preparation thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. this invention relates to esters of substituted 8-hydroxy l-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lh-3-benzazepines, processes for the preparation thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. the novel compounds of this invention show neuroleptic, antidepressive and antiagressive activity. substituted-l-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lh-3-benzazepines have been previously described in the art, as for example, in u.s. patent 3,393,192, british patent 1,118,688, danish patent 123033, u.s. patent 3,609,138 and u.s. patent 4,011,319. the prior art has recognized that substituted-1-phenyl-2 ,3 ,ii ,5-tetrahydro-111-3-benzaze- pines exhibit anti-bacterial effects, central nervous system effects and a hypotensive effect. the novel compounds of this invention are the esters of substituted 8-hydroxy-l-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- lh-3-benzazepines of the general formula i emi2.1 wherein x is chloro, bromo or trifluoromethyl; r1 is alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, cycloalkyl, l-adamantyl, cycloalkoxyalkyl, alkoxy, aralkoxy, cycloalkoxy or aryloxy; and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. the alkyl groups referred to above are branched or straight chain alkyl groups. r1 being alkyl may contain 1 to 20 preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. the alkyl moiety contained in the other groups mentioned above (e.g.aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl etc.) contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. these groups can be exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the corresponding branched chain isomers thereof. the alkoxy groups likewise contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms and are exemplified by methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy and the branched chain isomers thereof. preferably these groups contain 1 to 3 carbon atoms. the cycloalkyl groups referred to above contain 4 to 8 carbon atoms. the term aryl comprises unsubstituted phenyl and phenyl substituted by halogen, alkyl containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, (preferably one carbon atom), alkoxy containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, (preferably one carbon atom), hydroxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl or cyano. the acid addition salts of the compounds of formula i can be derived from a variety of inorganic and organic acids such as for example sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, methanesulfonic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, maleic, stearic, succinic, tartaric, fumaric, cinnamic, aspartic, acetic, benzoic, salicylic, gluconic, ascorbic and related acids. the compounds of formula i can be prepared by reacting a 7-x-8-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lh-3-benzazepine wherein x is as defined in the compound of formula i or an alkalimetal (especially sodium) salt thereof with an acid r1cooh, ii, wherein r1 is as defined for the compounds of formula i or a reactive derivative of the said acid. the term reactive derivative of the acid ii comprises the acid halides, acid anhydrides and r1- chloroformates. preferably the compounds of formula i wherein r1 is alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, cycloalkyl, l-adamantyl, or cycloalkoxyalkyl, are prepared using an acid halide in an anhydrous aprotic solvent in the presence of an acid acceptor. typically, acetonitrile is used as the solvent and sodium bicarbonate as the base, but a dual-function solvent such as pyridine may also be used. other solvents include dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. reaction temperatures and times are not critical with room temperature and
