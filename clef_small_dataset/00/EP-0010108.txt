<ABSTRACT>
the degradation of prostaglandins e is prevented or  minimized by combining prostaglandins e with methylhesÂ­ peridin.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
stabilized prostaglandin e composition this invention relates to a stabilized prostaglandin e composition. prostaglandins e exhibit various pharmacological activities and, when used in minor amounts, are useful in, for example, bronchodilatation, control of uterine contraction, suppression of acid secretion, treatment of and prevention against peptic ulcer, lowering of blood pressure, suppression of blood platelet aggregation and control of lipid metabolism. prostaglandins e are generally liable to be degraded by acid, base and/or heat, and cause some problems in prescription and dosage of the medicines thereof. when prostaglandins e are maintained at room temperature, degraded products can be detected several weeks later. at a higher temperature, for example, 100 c, a substantial part of prostaglandins e is degraded within a few hours. even when they are maintained in a refrigerator, it is recognized that degradation proceeds, although slowly. some proposals have been heretofore made to stabilize prostaglandins e. for example, it is described in k.c. srivastava and j. clausen: lipids, 8, p 592 - 594(1973) that prostaglandins e can be stabilized by dissolving them in an acid ester such as ethyl acetate, an alcohol such as ethyl alcohol, or chloroform. it now has been found, however, that methylhesperidin prevents or minimizes the degradation of prostaglandins e to a great extent. therefore, in accordance with the present invention there is provided a stabilized prostaglandin e composition comprising a prostaglandin e having incorporated therein a stabilizing amount of methylhesperidin. prostaglandins e to be stabilized by methylhesperidin include, for example, prostaglandin e2 (hereinafter abbreviated as "pge2"), prostaglandin e1 (hereinafter abbreviated as "pge1"), 13,14-dihydroprostaglandin e1 (hereinafter abbreviated as "pge0", 13,14-dihydro-pge2, 15-methyl-pge2, 15-methyl-pge1 15-methyl-pge0, l6-methyl-pge2, 16-methyl -pge1, 16-methyl-pge0, 16,16-dimethyl-pge2, 16,16-dimethyl -pge1, 16,16-dimethyl-pge0, 16,16-propano-pge2, 16,16 -propano-pge1, 16, l6-propano-pge0, i6-cyclohexyl- w-tetranor- -pge2, 16-phenyl-#-tetranor-pge2, 17-phenyl-#-trinor-pge2, 16-phenoxy- w-tetranor-pge2 and l6-m-chlorophenoxy-(p- -tetranor-pge2 alkyl esters (the alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms), such as methyl ester, ethyl ester and decyl ester, of these compounds and aralkyl esters thereof (the aralkyl group having from 7 to 15 carbon atoms) are also included in the prostaglandins e used in the present invention. furthermore, the prostaglandins e used in the present invention include compounds represented by the general formula: emi2.1 wherein r1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; r4 and r5 may be the same or different, and each of r4 and r5 represents independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a fluorine atom; r2 and r3 may be the same or different, and each of r2 and r3 represents independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a protective group for the hydroxyl group; ; r6 represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a substituted alkyl group having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, a substituted cycloalkyl group (the cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms), such as methyl -cyclohexyl group
