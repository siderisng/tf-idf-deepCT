<ABSTRACT>
the aim of the invention is to provide a hinge mechanism  for a coin testing mechanism which permits adequate separa­ tion of two plates, even close to the hinge axis, in conditions  where the separation of the plates remote from the hinge axis  must be limited.  the two plates 12 and 13 are coupled by a hinge pin 19  which passes through slots 21 in lugs 22 on the plate 13 and  holes in lugs 20 on the plate 12.  a coil spring 23 is disposed  around the hinge pin 19 and has its free ends secured to a  cantilever leaf spring 28 secured to the plate 13.  the slots 21  extend perpendicular to the plate 13 and the springs 23 and  28 co-operate to hold the hinge pin 19 in the bottom of the  slots 21.  the coil spring has a central loop 24 which bears  against the edge of the plate 12 and thus serves to bias the  two plates together about the hinge axis.  a lever 31 pivoted  on the plate 13 carries a cam surface 32 which co-operates  with a cam follower surface 35 on the plate 12 so that when  the lever is actuated the plates are forced progressively apart  by the cam surface riding up the cam follower surface.  the  coil spring 23 initially allows the plate 12 to pivot about the  hinge axis away from the plate 13 but eventually plate 12  strikes an abutment 38 which prevents further rotation of the  plate.  further movement of the cam surface up the cam fol­ lower surface causes the leaf spring 28 to flex and allow sepa­ ration of the plates along the edges adjacent the hinge pin 19.
