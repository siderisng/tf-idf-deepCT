<ABSTRACT>
reaction of phosphoric acid with ammonia by known  means to produce nitrogen phosphate fertilizer results in an  effluent gas containing ammonia together with fluoride and  other particulates.  conventionally, the effluent is washed with  aqueous phosphoric acid to remove ammonia and subse­ quently the effluent is scrubbed with large amounts of pond  water to remove residual particulates.  the large amounts of  pond water required means that large ponds have to be con­ structed and maintained and in addition to the undesirable  cost of so doing there is additional disadvantage in that large  areas of land cannot be put to better use.  the invention  enables treatment of the effluent with at least comparable  results but without the need for large ponds by washing the  effluent with concentrated aqueous phosphoric acid, for  example by contact in a venturi (16) of a chamber (14) in a  contactor (12), and contacting the remaining effluent with  target particles of solid sorbent, for example by injecting into  the effluent a sorbent-laden secondary gas stream in a  chamber (28), to capture particulates carried in the effluent.

<DESCRIPTION>
treatment of effluent gases from the manufacture of fertilizer ar products obtained thereby. this invent ion relates to an improved process for the reduction of air and water pollution resulting from the manufacture of fertilizer. in the manufacture of fertilizers aqueous phosphoric acids or acid salts thereof are produced and reacted with ammonia to produce various nitrogen grades of fertilizer such as monoammonium or diammonium phosphate. in one common process, phosphate roc' containing fluorapatite lca5f(po4)3# is ground and reacted with aqueous sulfuric acid. after filtering to separate gypsum and other insoluble by products, the crude aqueous phosphoric acid is concentrated by evaporation. substantial quantities of fluoride gases are produced which are scrubbed from the effluent gases and substantial cooling is required. large ponds are employed as repositories for insoluble by-products and as- a source of recycle water for washing the filters and for scrubbing and cooling. such ponds are costly to build and operate and are- of increasing concern as a source of water and air pollution. when aqueous phosphoric acid is reacted with ammonia, the resulting effluent gases contain substantial quantities of ammonia, fluoride, and other particulates. conventionally, these gases have been washed with aqueous phosphoric acid to recover ammonia and a portion of the particulates, and thereafter scrubbed with pond water in a packed enclosure before e7#austing to atmosphere. washing with phosphoric acid releases fluoride gases such as hf and sit, and copious quantities of pond water are subsequently required for cooling to more effectively remove the fluoride gases and submicron particulates. it has been estimated that the cooling ponds employer cost per acre between us #20,000 and us $30,000 to build and between us #20co and us $5000 per year to maintain. expensive piping is also required and all overflows must be carefully neutralized. a typical integrated site will require a cooling pond area of one hundred acres or more, about one-half of which may be required to scrub the effluent gases from the ammonia-phosphoric acid reactor. the phosphoric acid used to wash the gases has been restricted to aqueous concentrations between 201c and 4o# & p205 by weight because, at higher concentrations, increasing quantities of submicron fluoride particulates such as no4?, nr4?#hf and (iµh4)25if6 are produced which are very difficult to remove from the gases. as a result, substantial water is present in the ammoniated acid when it is returned to the process for drying and conversion to product. about 85-99$ of the ammonia in the effluent gases has been thus recovered. since pond water typically is highly acidic, scrubbing with phosphoric acid is sometimes omitted and pond water is employed throughout. as will be appreciated from the specific stample- which follows, the present invention enables the effluent gases from an ammonium fertilizer reactor to be treated more effectively and more economically, without the need for cooling water with its attendant cooling pond. the invention also enables- an improved rate of recovery of ammonia and a decrease in the water load on the dryer, and enables
