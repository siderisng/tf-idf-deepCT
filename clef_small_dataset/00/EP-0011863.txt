<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for controlling the cycles of ac power supplied  to a variable thermal load in response to analog signals rep­ resenting the temperature of the load comprising means for  quantizing the analog signals into digital signals and control­ ling the proportion of integral cycles of ac current blocked to  those supplied to said load, while providing a uniform spacing  in time of the integral full cycles supplied, in accordance with  said digital signals.  also means are provided for modifying  said digital signals in response to a predetermined average  current overload.

<DESCRIPTION>
teseerature controller for a heated roller this invention relates, in general, to heated fusing roller apparatus for affixing toner material to a substrate to form permanent images thereon and, more particularly, to means for controlling the power input to the heated roller for maintaining substantially constant the surface temperature of the heated roller at an area where it contacts the toner material. in the process of electrostatic or magnetic printing, information is typically recorded in the form of a latent electrostatic or magnetic image on a recording member with subsequent rendering of the latent image visible by the application of electrostatic and/or magnetic marking particles, commonly referred to as toner. the visual image can be either fixed directly upon the recording member or transferred from the member to a sheet of plain paper with subsequent affixing of the image thereto. in order to permanently affix or fuse a toner material onto a record medium, such as paper, it is necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the constituents of the toner material coalesce and become adhesive. this action causes the toner to be absorbed to some extent into the fibers of che record medium. pressure is somet-mes used to increase the adhesive. there after, as the toner material is cooled, solidification of the toner material occurs causing the toner material to be firmly bonded to the reccrd medium. in both the electrostatic and magnetic printing arts, the use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is old and well-known. one approach to thermal fusing of toner images onto a record medium has been to pass the record medium with the toner images thereon between a pair of opposed rollers, at least one of which is either externally or internally heated. in this type of arrangement, the toner image contacts the surface of the heated roller member in the nip between rollers to thereby produce heating of the toner image within the nip. in apparatus utilizing a fuser roller pair as described above, it is important that the heated roller surface be maintained within a suitable temperature range to properly fuse the toner image to its record medium. a conventional manner for accomplishinq the foregoing is by the emplovment of a temp erature sensitive device which is coupled to the heated roller and whose output controls the heat source. a suit able arrangement is described in u.s. patent application serial no. 965,881 entitled "non-contact temoerature sensor for a fusing roller" filed december 4, 1978 and assigned to a common assignee. where ac power is involved the output either switches power on or off completely until the roller temperature reaches a desired level or switches different partial cycles of power as by a silicon controlled rectifier (scr) until the desired temnerature level is reached. these prior art arrangements hae exhibited shortcomings. some of these have produced overshoots and undershoots of temperature beyond the desired narrcw range f desirable temperatures. others have
