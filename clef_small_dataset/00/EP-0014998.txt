<ABSTRACT>
tertiary aromatic amines are prepared by the reductive  alkylation of diaryl secondary amines with ketones in the  presence of hydrogen and a heterogenous hydrogenation  catalyst.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
the present inventiom relates to the use ci heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts tor the reductive alkylation of diaryl secondary amines with ketones in the presence of hydrogen to produce n-alkyldiaryl tertiary amines. such tertiary aromatic amines and their derivatives are useful as fabric softeners asphalt emulsifiers, petroleum additives, floatation agents, chemical intermediates, and as stabilizers for polymers, rubbers, gasoline, and synthetic lubricants. the present invention relates to a method for preparing a compound having the formula a-nr-b wherein a is phenyl, naphthyl, phenyl substituted with up to three groups, which may be the same or different and may be chlorine, bromine, linear or branched cl-c12 alkyl, or naphthyl substituted with linear or branched c1-c12 alkyl; b may be the same as or different from a and has the meanings of a, provided that b does not have more than three substituents including an amino moiety, or b is -c6h4nrúrê, wherein rú and rê may be the same or different and are hydrogen, provided that at least one of r1 and r2 is other than hydrogen, linear or branched cl-c18 alkyl, c5-c6 cycloalkyl, or c6-c10 aryl, provided that only one of r1 and r2 is naphthyl, and r is -chr4r5 wherein r4 and r5 may be the same or different and are linear or branched c1-c18 alkyl or r4 and r5 combined are tetramethylene or pentamethylene; by reacting a compound of the formula a-nh-b, wherein a and b have the meanings defined above, except that rú or rê or both may be hydrogen, with a compound having the formula ocr4r5 wherein r4 and r4 are as defined above; in the presence of an heterogeneous catalyst selected from metals of groups 1b, 6b, 7b and 8 or their oxides or sulfides, and copper chromite, except for silver, gold, technetium, manganese and chromium and their oxides or sulfides, in the presence of hydrogen. the present invention also relates to compounds produced by the process of the present invention and to certain novel compounds of the formula a-nb-b wherein a, r and b are as defined above. in a preferred method of the present invention the starting materials are compounds of the formula a-nh-b wherein a is phenyl or naphthyl; b is phenyl, naphthyl or -c6h4nr1r2 wherein r1 is c1-c3 alkyl, phenyl or naphthyl, and r2 is hvdrogen, linear or branched c1-c7 alkyl or cyclohexyl; and r is -chr4r5, wherein r4 is methyl and r5 is c1-c5 alkyl or r4 and r5 combined are pentamethylene, or either rú or rê or both are hydrogen. non-limiting examples of the aryl groups a and b are phenyl and naphthyl. the aryl groups may be substituted on the ring by one or more groups, such as alkyl, phenyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, halo, carboxyl and carboxyl derivatives, thioester, etc., that are not affected by the hydrogenation. non-limiting examples of diaryl secondary amines useful in the invention are diphenylamine, 3-methyldiphenylamine, n, n'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine , n , n '- diph enylb enzi din e n -phenylanthranilic acid, n-phenyl-l -naphthylamine, n-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, n -phenyl-n '
