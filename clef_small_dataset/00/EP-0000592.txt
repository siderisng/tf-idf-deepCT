<ABSTRACT>
1.  a cooled piston for internal combustion engines, particularly for diesel engines, which consists entirely or in part of ferrous material and is formed in the piston head (3) behind the ring portion with a cooling passage (8, 22), which forms a continuous peripheral ring at least adjacent to the uppermost ring groove (12), which piston comprises freely suspended piston pin bosses (1), which are connected by ribs (2, 4, 23, 24) to the inside surface of the piston head and to the piston skirt (5), which is formed with apertures (7) in registry with the openings of the piston pin bosses (6), the cooling passage being connected to the coolant-circulating system by suitable coolant supply and drain conduits (9, 10, 26, 27), which extend substantially parallel to the piston axis, characterized in that the piston consists of a plurality of parts (3, 5, 17, 18, 20), which are firmly joined by an intermetallic interlayer at the interfacial planes (16, 19, 21).
