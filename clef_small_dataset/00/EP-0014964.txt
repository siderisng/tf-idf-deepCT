<ABSTRACT>
apparatus comprising a frame (11), a series of four pairs  of guide rolls (25,26,31,32,43,44,58,59) rotatable on shafts on  the frame, a coupling member (12) provided with a pair of  v-shaped converging guide channels (17,18) and withdraw­ ing means (74,77).  said first (25,26), second (31,32), third  (43,44), fourth (58,59) pairs of rolls, coupling member (12) and  withdrawing means (74,77) are arranged in the order named  for directing a pair of continuous sliding clasp fastener strin­ gers (20,21) along their respective paths leading in coplanar  relation to the pair of guide channels (17,18) in the coupling  member (12) and so that the row of coupling elements (22) of  the stringers can be interengaged smoothly and reliably with­ out damage to the stringers.
