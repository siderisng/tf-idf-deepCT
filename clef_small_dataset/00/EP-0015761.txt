<ABSTRACT>
a polymer containing carboxylate groups which is  formed by polymerization, in the absence of toxic or  inflammable solvents, of a water-soluble salt of a compound  of the formula:    in which r represents c₁₅h31-n, c₁₇h35-n or c₁₁h₂₃ in which n  is 0, 2, 4 or 6, and   x represents h or oh,   with an aldehyde, preferably formaldehyde in the form of  paraformaldehyde.  preferred starting materials are derived  from both natural and technical cashew nut shell liquid  (cnsl) including 4-pentadecyl-salicyclic acid and 5-pen­ tadecylresorcinol-2-carboxylic acid, both new compounds,  obtained by subjecting technical cnsl to carboxylation by  the kolbe reaction.  the components may be polymerized in  alkaline aqueous medium and used to bond particulate and/­ or fibrous materials, e. g.  particle board of wood chips.

<DESCRIPTION>
polymer, preparation and formulations for preparation thereof, use for production of bonded materials, inter mediates and preparation thereof. this invention relates to polymers, to their preparation and to their use as bonding agents in the production of bonded particulate or fibrous material. in particular the invention relates to polymers containing carboxylate groups which are formed by polymerizing certain carboxyl-containing phenols with aldehydes. proposals have hitherto been made to produce particle board by using as a binder a polymer of cashew nut shell liquid (cnsl) with an aldehyde. such processes have however required the use of organic and chlorinated solvents which may be undesirably toxic, inflammable or expensive. it has now been found that similar polymers may be obtained in which the use of such solvents is obviated. therefore according to the invention there is provided a polymer containing carboxylate groups characterised in that it is formed by polymerization of a water-soluble salt of a compound of the formula: emi2.1 in which r represents c15h31¯nss c17h35-n or c11 23 in which n is 0, 2, 4 or 6, and x represents h or oh, with an aldehyde. the polymer of the invention may be used in the preparation of bonded particulate or fibrous materials to effect the bond between the particles and/or fibres. the compounds of formula (i) are generally naturally occurring materials. for example, pelandjauic acid, the compound in which x is h, r is c17h35 and the cooh is ortho to r and oh, is present in latex extracted from certain trees. anagigantic acid, the compound in which x is h, r is c11h23 and the cooh is ortho to r and oh is present in the nutshells obtained from the tree anacardium giganteum. a particularly preferred compound of formula (i) is anacardic acid, in which x is h, r is c15h31-n and the cooh is ortho to r and oh, which is obtained from the outer shell of the cashew nut obtained from the cashew nut shell tree, anacardium occidentale. cashew nut shell liquid (cnsl) is extracted from the outer shell of the cashew nut obtained from the cashew nut tree, anacardium occidentale, after the kernels have been removed by freezing and fracturing. in the shell cnsl comprises anacardic acid (2-carboxy-3-pentadecadienyl phenol) at a level exceeding 70% and related acids of different degrees of unsaturation, together with cardol (m-pentadecadienyl resorcinol). there are two main processes for extracting cnsl. according to one process a cold solvent extraction is conducted on the shells, for example as disclosed in united states patent specification no. 1 954 650 and in j.h.p. tyman, j. chem. soc. perkin i trans. 1973, 1639. cold solvent extracted cnsl consists essentially of anacardic acid and minor amounts of cardol. this liquid may be used directly for the production of a polymer of the invention providing an alkali metal hydroxide is present to form the salt in situ. alternatively the liquid may be pre-treated to form the salt. cardol and other constituents which are non-carboxylic, may be incorporated
