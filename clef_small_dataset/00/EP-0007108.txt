<ABSTRACT>
in a diffraction grating made of a single crystalline silicon  substrate, one major plane thereof is provided with a plurality  of asymmetric triangular grooves, each having a wall inclined  by an angle ϑ with respect to the major surface so as to satisfy  an equation   ϑ = sin ⁻¹    where ϑ represents the blaze angle, p the pitch of the groove,  λb the blazing wavelength, and m the order of diffraction.  the  walls of each groove receiving incident light is covered with a  metal coat.  the diffraction grating is prepared by using a (hkℓ) plane  (where h = k) inclined by ϑ with respect to the (111) plane of  the single crystalline silicon as a major surface, and then  anisotropic-etching the major surface through an etching  mask having stripes having sufficiently smaller width than the  grating constant.  preferably, following the anisotropic etch­ ing, isotropic etching is made for the major surface.
