<ABSTRACT>
the invention writes measured value curves onto a recording strip by comparing, line for line, the curve values with reference values which rise in a chronologically linear fashion and in the case of identity a control pulse for writing a curve point is emitted, the distance of which from a zero line corresponds to the magnitude of the curve value.  in the case of rapid changes of the curve values, the curve points may lie far apart from one another so that the curve progression cannot easily be detected.  the present invention has the object of writing closed curves even in the event of rapid changes of the curve values.  this object is achieved in that two comparators (vgl1, vgl2) are provided, the reference values being fed to the one signal which is recorded in the one write line and to the other signal which is to be recorded in the following write line and to both, and in that a logic circuit (exo) is connected to the comparators (vgl1, vgl2), which circuit emits a control signal to the recording element (afe1; afe2) as long as the reference value is smaller than the signal value recorded in the one write line and greater than the signal value to be recorded in the following line or as long as the reference value is greater than the signal value recorded in the one write line and smaller than the signal value to be recorded in the following line.  <image>
