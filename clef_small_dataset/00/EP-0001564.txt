<ABSTRACT>
1.  cable fitting for synthetic resin-insulated heavy current cables, in particular for multiconductor low-voltage cables, wherein the set-up cable end or ends, or the correspondingly prepared cable section, is or are surrounded by a two-layer insulating covering, the inner layer of which consists of a soft-elastic synthetic resin and the outer, mechanically-stable layer of which consists of a foamed or unfoamed, hardened synthetic resin material mass having an epoxide or polyurethane basis, and which can be poured before curing, and wherein the wall thickness or the average wall thickness of the inner layer is less than the wall thickness or the average wall thickness of the outer layer, characterised in that the inner, heat-resistant layer which adheres tightly to the cable conductors and the connection elements, consists of a silicon gel (1) whose shore a-hardness is less than 5 and whose needle penetration value is more than 250 mm/10 and which is cross-linked by means of only about 0. 2 to 0. 5% by weight of silane, and that the outer layer (3) is formed as a two-part casting mould for the inner layer and is highly enriched with fillers.
