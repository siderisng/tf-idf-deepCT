<DESCRIPTION>
derivatives of n-trifworoacetyl- n-phosprcncmethylglycine dichloride this invention relates to n-trifluoroacetyl-nphosphonomethylglycine dichloride derivatives, to herbicidal compositions containing same and to herbicidal methods. more particularly, this invention relates to n-trifluoroacetyl-n-phosphonomethylglycine trichlorides and to the monoesters of such compound. in accordance with u.s. patent no. 3,970,695, issued july 20, 1976, n-perfluoroacy;-n-phosphonomethyl- glycines of the formula emi1.1 wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and m is 1 or 0 are produced by reacting a perfluoroacyl anhydride with n-phosphonomethylglycine in the presence of a perfluoroalkanoic acid to form the compound of the formula wherein m is 1 and then by hydrolysis to form the compounds wherein m is 0. n-phosphonomethylglycine, its salts, amides, esters and other derivatives are disclosed in u.s. patent no. 3,799,758 and are shown to be post-emergent herbicides. other derivatives of n-phosphonomethylglycine and the plant growth regulation use thereof are disclosed in u.s. patent no. 3,853,530. the n-trifluoroacetyl-n-phosphonomethylglycine dichloride derivatives of this invention are those having the formula emi2.1 wherein r is chlorine, an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkoxy group containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkoxyalkoxy group containing from 5 to 9 carbon atoms or a chloro lower alkoxy group. as employed herein, "chloro lower alkoxy" designates those alkoxy groups containing up through four carbon atoms in a straight or branched chains and up to three chlorine groups. illustrative of-the alkoxyalkoxy groups which r re.presents are methoxyethoxy, methoxypropoxy, methoxybutoxy, ethoxyethoxy, ethoxypropoxy, propoxyethoxy, propoxypropoxy and the like. illustrative of the alkoxyalkoxyalkoxy groups represented by r are, for example, methoxyethoxyethoxy, methoxyethoxypropoxy, methoxypropoxypropoxy, methoxypropo.y- but oxy, ethoxyethoxyethoxy, propoxypropoxypropoxy and the like. the compounds of this invention are prepared by reacting an n-phwosphononethylgiycine of the formula emi2.2 or ester thereof wherein r' is hydroxy or an r group as hereinabove defined except that r' cannot be chlorine with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride at temperatures from about 100c. to about 350c. and then treating the reaction product with excess thionyl chloride under refluxing conditions. for best yields, the intermediate reaction product is preferably stripped of the excess trifluoroacetic anhydride prior to the addition of the thionyl chloride. the excess thionyl chloride is removed after the reaction is completed to yield the compounds of this invention. the compounds of this invention are useful as herbicides. the herbicidal composition of the present invention is characterised in that said composition comprises from about 5 to about 95 parts by weight of a compound characterised by the formula emi3.1 wherein r is chlorine, an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkoxy group containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkoxyalkoxy group containing from 5 to 9 carbon atoms or a chloro lower alkoxy group; the remaining parts being composed of one or more suitable carriers, diluents and/or adjuvants. the herbicidal method of the present invention comprises applying to plants a herbicidally effective amount of a compound characterised by the formula emi4.1 wherein r is chlorine, an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 10 carbon
