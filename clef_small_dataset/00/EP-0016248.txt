<ABSTRACT>
a method for producing a prepreg roving, which com­ prises impregnating a composition comprising an unsatu­ rated polyester, an unsaturated monomer (e. g.  styrene) and a  polysocyanate compound (e. g.  4,4′-diphenylmethane  diisocyanate) in a filamentary reinforcing material (1) (e. g.  a  glass roving) and then heating the impregnated reinforcing  material to react the unsaturated polyester with the  polyisocyanate compound, thereby bringing the resin to the  b-stage; and a method for producing a fiber-reinforced plastic  article, which comprises disposing prepreg rovings (a), said  prepreg rovings being prepared by the above method bet­ ween at least two plies of sheet molding compound (b)  obtained by impregnating a composition comprising an  unsaturated polyester and an unsaturated monomer in glass  fibers and forming the impregnated product into a sheet; and  consolidating the resulting assembly under heat and pres­ sure.  - figure 1 is a flow chart showing the production of the  prepreg roving mentioned above.
