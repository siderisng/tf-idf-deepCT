<ABSTRACT>
conveyor apparatus for grouping articles into batches  comprising a double-belt or multi-belt structure of which the  innermost belt (12) is endless and the other belts (15) are in  sections and wherein the respective belts are arranged to be  individually controlled in speed (27, 25).  in one preferred form  the apparatus, which is of the kind comprising a first endless  conveyor belt (12) and separation means, is characterised in  that said separating means comprises a second conveyor belt  section (15) which is spaced from said endless belt and  arranged for circulation around said endless belt in the same  direction, and in that said first and second conveyors are  arranged to be controlled in speed independently (25,27) of  each other, the arrangement being such that those articles  supplied continuously from the preceding stage can be  grouped into batches by being conveyed on the endless belt  (12) or belt section (15) as appropriate without interrupting the  conveyance flow of said articles, separation of the batches  being accomplished by control of the relative speeds of said  endless belt and said belt section.
