<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to front suspension systems for electric  vehicles having front wheel drive.  vehicles of the kind for  which the system is particularly applicable are those which are  not designed for high speeds.  in rear wheel drive electric vehicles,  the motor has been mounted directly on a rigid axle which  is connected to the vehicle frame by springs, but as a consequence  the unsprung weight is large.  this arrangement per se is  unsatisfactory for a front wheel drive vehicle where the spring  characteristics are more critical.  according to the present invention a front suspension  system is characterised by at least two arms (11, 12, 30, 31, 30′,  31′, 32, 32′) provided between a rigid front axle (3) and frame  members (21, 22) of the vehicle, at least one of said arms (12,  30, 31, 30′, 31′, 32, 32′) being articulated to the axle (3) and all  arms extending mainly horizontally from the axle and being  connected to the frame members (21, 22) by means of ball joints  (13, 14, 33, 34).  a differential unit (4) is arranged at a central  point on the axle (3) and an electric motor (5) is mounted directly  on the differential unit (4) which extends substantially horizontally  and in the same direction as the arms (11, 12, 30, 31, 30′,  31′, 32, 32′) so that the centre of gravity of the motor (5) is all the  time lying substantially stationary on a line (l) through said ball  joints (13, 14, 33, 34).  the system supports the vehicle body on  springs (17, 18) extending between the axle (3) and the frame  members (21, 22).  the system of the invention may be constructed as a  separate module for fitting to one of a variety of vehicles.
