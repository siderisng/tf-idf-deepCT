<DESCRIPTION>
4-phenyl-l,3-benzodiazepines and method of preparing the same this invention relates to novel 4-plienyl-i,3-benzo- diazepines, which are useful as antidepressants, analgetics, anticonvulsants, to methodsof their preparation, to methods of treatment with pharmaceutically effective amounts thereof and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such a compound as an active ingredient. this invention also relates to novel compounds which are intermediates in the preparation of said 4-phenyl-1,3-benzodiazepines. the compounds of the present invention have not been described. rodriguez et al., in u.s. patent 3,681,340 entitled "1,3-benzodiazepines" teaches that compounds of the formula emi1.1 in which r1 is hydrogen, free or etherified oh or sh, amino or an aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic radical; r2 is hydrogen or an acyl, aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic radical; n-oxides and quaternaries and salts thereof, exhibit central nervous system depressing and coronary dilating effects. the compounds of this invention have the formula i emi2.1 in which r and r1 are the same or different and each can be hydrogen, alkyl of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl-c1 -c3 -alkyl wherein the cycloalkyl radical has 3-6 carbon atoms, particularly cyclohexylmethyl, or aralkyl having up to 8 carbon atoms, particularly benzyl. x and y are the same or different and each can be chlorine, bromine, fluorine, alkoxy or alkyl each of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, hydroxy, or trifluoromethyl; m is the integer 0, 1 or 2; nd n is the integer 0, 1, 2 or 3. also included within the scope of the present invention are the optical antipodes and the physiologically acceptable salts of the above-depicted compounds. novel intermediate compounds, which are also the subject of this invention, utilized in the preparation of the benzodiazepines of this invention, have the formula ii emi3.1 in which r1, x, y, m and n are as previously defined. the physiologically acceptable salts of the present invention are acid addition salts which may be prepared from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and perchloric acids, as well as from organic acids such as tartaric, citric, acetic, succinic, maleic, furmaric and oxalic. the compounds of the present invention can be pre pared according to the following sequence of reactions in which r, r1, x, y, m and n are as previously defined, unless otherwise indicated. a) a 2-(2-nitrophenyl)acetophenone of the formula iii emi4.1 is converted to an oxime of the formula iv emi4.2 by any convenient method known to the art. a preferred method involves refluxing the acetophenone in a mixture of ethyl alcohol, aqueous sodium acetate and hydroxylamine. b) a compound of formula iv is acylated with acetic anhydride to provide the corresponding oxime acetate of the formula emi4.3 c) a compound of formula v is carefully reduced to provide the corresponding 2-nitro-a-phenylphenethylamine of the formula vi emi5.1 the reducing agent used in this step must be compatible with the phenyl nitro group. diborane is preferred. additionally, this reduction is carried out in the presence of a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and at a low temperature of from about ooc
