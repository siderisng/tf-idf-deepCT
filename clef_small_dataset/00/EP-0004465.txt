<ABSTRACT>
water and carbon dioxide contaminants are removed from a feed gas stream by adsorption in first and second adsorbent zones arranged in series.  regeneration of the adsorbent zones is accomplished by (a) introducing a heated regeneration gas intermediate the first and second adsorbent zones and passing the heated regeneration gas through the first adsorbent zone; and (b) subsequently passing a low temperature regeneration gas sequentially through the second and first adsorbent zones.
