<ABSTRACT>
a semiconductor switch device comprising a semicon­ ductor body (10), a pair of main electrodes (12, 14) and a con­ trol electrode (13), the body consisting of a first region (20) of  n⁺-type conductivity, a second region (15) of p⁺-type con­ ductivity, both first and second regions being in contact with  one main electrode (12), a third region (16) of n⁻-type con­ ductivity, a fourth region (17) of p-type conductivity, and a  fifth region (19) of n-type conductivity, the fourth region be­ ing sandwiched between the third and fifth regions except in­ the vicinity of the second region, said semiconductors re­ gions thereby constituting a p-n junction diode and a bipolar  transistor arranged adjacent each other within the semicon­ ductor body (10) so that their conductive directions are  equal.  one electrode of the diode and an emitter (or collec­ tor) electrode of the transistor, and the other electrode of the  diode and the collector (or emitter) electrode of the transis­ tor are respectively formed continuously as the pair of main  electrodes.  separately, a base electrode of the transistor is  formed as the control electrode.  this semiconductor switch device has a higher break-­ down voltage than a conventional transistor, and can control  high power with low control power.  it also has a shorter  turn-off time than a conventional field controlled thyristor.
