<ABSTRACT>
modified organopolysiloxane compositions containing  in situ generated particulate matter and a method for  preparing the same which comprises polymerizing organic  monomers having aliphatic unsaturation in the presence of  vinyl containing organopolysiloxanes and free radical initiators  at an elevated temperature to form a composition in  which one or more of the organopolysiloxane molecules  have organic groups grafted thereto through a carbon-to-carbon  linkage.  the resultant composition may be cured to  an elastomeric solid by combining the composition obtained  from the polymerization with organosilicon compounds  having an average of more than two hydrogen atoms per  molecule and a catalyst which promotes the addition of sih  groups to vinyl groups.
