<ABSTRACT>
skin conditioning compositions comprising a long chain alkyl ester of a fatty acid, an emollient material, an emulsifier and water.  the long chain alkyl ester and the emollient combine to provide a very occlusive, cosmeticly acceptable, film on skin thereby reducing moisture loss therefrom. 
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
skin conditioning compositions the present invention relates to novel skin condi toning compositions which form a very water occlusive film on skin thereby reducing moisture loss from the skin surface. the treatment of human skin with various agents has been undertaken for many years with the goal being to keep the skin in a smooth and supp1e:2condition. skin has the tendency to dry out when exposed to condi tions of low humidity or to extended periods in a detergent solution. from a biochemical standpoint,-dryness is a measure of the water content of the skin. under normal conditions, the water content and vapor pressure of the epidermis are higher than those of the surrounding air with consequent evaporation of water from the skin surface. skin becomes dry because of the excessive loss of water from the surface and the subsequent loss of water from the stratum corneum. continuous and prolonged immersion in soap or deter gent solutions may contribute to dryness of the stratum corneum. the reason for this is that the surfactant medium promotes dissolution of the skin surface lipids, the horny layer lipids, and the dissolution of the hygroscopic water-soluble components in the corneum. to alleviate the aforementioned conditions, emollient creams as described in sagarin, cosmetics science and technology, 2nd edition, vol. 1, wiley interscience (1972) have been recommended for application to the skin. the emollient materials probably increase the state of hydration of the corneous layer of the skin by altering the rate of diffusion of water from the lower epidermal and dermal layers, the rate of evaporation of water from the skin's surface, and the ability of the corneous layer to hold moisture. numerous other references have disclosed the use of a wide variety of materials for alleviating the problems of dry skin. included among such-references are those in which long chain esters of the type used in the-compositions of the present invention have been disclosed. u.s. patent 3,959,491, may 25, 1976 to young et al discloses a milk based cosmetic which may contain esters such as dodecyl stearate and other components including fatty acids and emulsifiers technical bulletins sg-0202 and sg-0211 distributed by scher chemicals, inc. have also disclosed skin treat ment compositions containing long chain esters, alco- hols and surfactants. however, none of these references teach or suggest the invention as set forth herein disclosure of the invention the present invention relates to superior skin conditioning cempositons comprisi2ig from about 0.1% to about lg% of a long chain alkyl ester of a fatty acid, an emollict an an amount such that the amount of long chain alkyl ester and the emollient is from about 0.2t tes about 25%, from about 0.05% to about 8% of an emulsifier and the remainder water. the materials from which the emulsifier and the emollient may be selected are discussed below. detailed description of the invention it has been discovered that compositions comprising the above generally described components possess superior occlusive properties4 the compositions, in addition to their occlusiveness, possess
