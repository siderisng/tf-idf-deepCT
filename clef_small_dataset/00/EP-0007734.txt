<ABSTRACT>
a carbon monoxide combustion promoter is introduced  to the circulating inventory of catalyst in a catalytic cracking  unit as a mixture of particles rich in metal with particles free of  metal, the net concentration of metal in the mixture being  about 1 to 10 ppm.  according to a preferred embodiment the  particles rich in metal contain about 50 ppm of platinum,  iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium or rhenium.   when such mixtures are supplied to the circulating inventory,  the specific activity of the metal for carbon monoxide oxidaÂ­ tion is enhanced, the activity of the mixture being higher than  that of a catalyst in which the same quantity of metal is evenly  distributed among all the particles.
