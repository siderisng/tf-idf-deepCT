<ABSTRACT>
new tricyclic ortho-fused heterocyclic compounds of  formula    wherein a is the group r  or the group n    in which r represents hydrogen, (c₁₋₄) alkyl, phenyl or tolyl  and r₁ may be (c₁₋₄) alkyl, phenyl or tolyl, r₂ is selected from  (c₁₋₄) alkyl, (c₂₋₄) alkanoylmethyl, carbo-(c₁₋₃) alkoxymethyl,  hydroxy (c₂₋₄) alkyl, halo (c₂₋₄) alkyl and a group    wherein r₃ is an alkylene group from 2 to 4 carbon atoms  and r₄ and r₅ independently represent hydrogen or (c₁₋₄)  alkyl or, taken together with the nitrogen atom, a fully  hydrogenated 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic radical which  may contain a further heteroatom selected from o, n and s  and be optionally substituted by a (c₁₋₄) alkyl or phenyl  group, or r₂ may represent nil, the dotted lines x and y may  represent nil or additional bonds; with the proviso that,  when the symbol r₂ linked to the oxygen atom is different  from nil, x is an additional bond and y and the other symbol  r₂ represent nil; with the further proviso that, when the  symbol r₂ linked to the nitrogen atom is different from nil, y  is an additional bond and x and the other symbol r₂,  represent nil; and salts therewith of pharmaceutically acceptable  acids.  the compounds possess antiinflammatory cns-depressant  and anti-anxiety utility.
