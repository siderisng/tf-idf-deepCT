<ABSTRACT>
the container of the invention is adapted to contain a  liquid or viscous substance (15) such as a sealing compound  or an adhesive in an air tightly sealed condition.  the  container comprises a rigid or stiff peripheral wall (10) which  is closed at one end by means of a distendable membrane  (16) the outer surface of which is exposed to ambient  atmospheric pressure.  in a preferred embodiment the container  is shaped as a cylindrical cartridge which is closed at  the other end by means of an ejection piston (13).  the  distendable membrane may be made from a stretchable  sheet material which is fastened to the cylindrical container  body in a tight condition, whereafter the sheet material is  permanently stretched by filling a heated substance into the  container and exposing said substance to a compressive  force.

<DESCRIPTION>
a container for containing liquid substances and a method for making the same ¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯ the present invention relates to a container or package for 'containing liquid substances, especially viscous substances, in a hermetically sealed condition, and comprising a substantially rigid or stiff peripheral wall. such containers or packages containing liquid or viscous substances are often stored for a long period of time under greatly varying temperature conditions before the content of the container is used. as the thermal coefficients of expansion of the container and its content, respectively, are normally different a partial vacuum may be generated in containers or packages of the type in question. when sealing compounds, adhesives, and other similar viscous masses or substances are packed in containers or packages of this known type the more fluid components, such as solvents, have a disadvantageous tendency to separate during storage of containers or packages containing such viscous substances or masses. it has been found that this tendency to separation of fluid components is substantially reduced by using the container according to the invention which is characterized in that the peripheral wall is air-tightly closed at one end thereof by a distendable membrane or wall part. this advantage is presumably due to the fact that even during storage with greatly varying temperature conditions the content of a container according to the invention is not exposed to pressure conditions differing substantially from the ambient atmospheric pressure because the distendable membrane or wall part will function as a kind of thermal expansion and contraction compensator. the said membrane or wall part may possibly be'protected against mechanical stresses, for example by means of a lid-shaped rigid end wall. however, in this case the said end wall must be provided with one or more greater or smaller air passages securing that the outer surface of the distendable membrane or wall part is always exposed to the ambient atmospheric pressure. if desired, the distendable membrane or wall part may be sealed to the lid-shaped end wall along its periphery, and when the content has been filled into the container or package the distendable membrane or wall part may be fastened thereto together with and possibly also by means of the lid-shaped end wall. alternatively, the rim portion of the membrane or wall part may be wedged or clamped between the container and the lid-shaped end wall without being united with the latter. in any case, the lidshaped end wall may have a form so that the distendable membrane or wall part may freely move so as to compensate for variations of the volume of the substance or mass contained in the container. thus, the container or package according to the invention may, for example, have the form of a bucket or pot provided with a lid. the invention may, however, with special advantage be used in connection with a cylindrical container or cartridge for containing a sealing compound, an adhesive, or other viscous masses or substances, and'of the type being closed at one
