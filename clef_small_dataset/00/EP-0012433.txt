<DESCRIPTION>
1(1-aminoalkyl)tricyclo[4,3,1,12,5]undecanes and pharmaceutical preparations containing them. the present invention relates to 1-(1-aminoalkyl)tricyclo [4,3,1,12,5]undecanes and pharmaceutical preparations containing them. more particularly, the present invention relates to 1-(1-aminoalkyl)tricyclo[4,3,1,12,5]undecanes of formula (i): emi1.1 wherein r represents a lower alkyl group, acid addition salts thereof as well as pharmaceutical preparations containing them. it is well known that some of the so-called "cage" compounds have anti-rna-viral activity. however, almost no compounds having anti-dna-viral activity are known. only tromantadine, i.e., 1-(dimethylmino- ethoxyacetamido)adamantane hydrochloride, has been reported as being an anti-dna-viral substance (see japanese patent publication no. 32526/1974). recently, it has been reported that 1-aminotricyclo/413,1,1215/- undecane hydrochloride has an e:cellent effect against newcastle disease virus, which is one of the paramyxo viruses belonging to rna viruses, in a chick embryo cell in'vitro test system (see japanese patent laid open no. 50150/1978 and u. s. patent no. 4 104 305). however, almost no other amine derivatives of tricyclol4,3,1,12'5]undecane are known the inventors have discovered new amine derivatives of tricyclo[4,3,1,12,5]undecane having an antiviral activity. the present invention has been completed on the dasis of this discovery. the present invention provides l-(l-aminoalkyl) tricyclo[4,3,l,l215jundecanes of formula (i): emi2.1 wherein r represents a lower alkyl group, and acid addition salts thereof. amines of the formula (i), according to the invention, are obtained, for example, by reducing the oximes of formula (ii), emi2.2 wherein r represents said lower alkyl group (hereinafter referred to as oximes (ii)). the lower alkyl groups r in the above formulas; for example are alkyl groups of 1-6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, amyl and hexyl. the compound wherein r is methyl -is readily available and is particularly preferred. oximes (ii) can be reduced to the amines of formula (i) by reducing the same, for example, with metallic sodium in an absolute lower alcohol (bourmaault- blanc reaction). as the lower alcohols used, ethyl alcohol is the most suitable. in addition, as the lower alcohols, there can be mentioned propyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol and methyl alcohol. the metallic sodium used may be in the form of either small pieces or finely divided powder particles. the lower alcohol is used generally in great excess in the reaction system because it also acts as a solvent. it is preferred to use metallic sodium in an amount several times as much as the theoretically required amount for carrying out the reduction reaction completely. specifically, it is effective to use metallic sodium in an amount of 5 to 30 moles per mole of the oxime. the reaction proceeds at a temperature in the range of from ambient temperature up to about 100 c. when ethyl alcohol is used as the lower alcohol, it is most convenient to reflux the reaction mixture at its boiling point. the conversion of oximes (ii) into amines of formula (i) can also be effected by hydrogenation in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, in addition to the aforementioned method wherein it is reduced with metallic sodium in a lower alcohol. as the hydrogenation
