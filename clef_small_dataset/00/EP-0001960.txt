<ABSTRACT>
1.  system for fixing an appliance (2) to a cartridge of fluid under pressure (1), possessing a sampling and/or filling valve (1e) and an annular rim (1d), which surrounds this valve, said fixing system comprising : a central core (4) integral with said appliance, possessing fluid sampling means (5), which are intended to interact with the valve (1e) of said cartridge, an annular piece (3) surrounding the central core (4), possessing on its periphery several hooking members (9, 13, 20), which can be snapped under the annular rim (1d) of the cartridge (1), each hooking member possessing a hooking catch (9c, 14, 24), which is movable towards the recessed wall of said annular rim of the cartridge, means of displacing the central core (4) axially in relation to and within the annular piece (3), possessing, on the one hand, a tapping on the inside of the annular piece (3) and, on the other hand, a threading on the outside of the central core (4), with which said tapping interacts, characterised in that the hooking members (9, 13, 24) can be snapped on the inside of the annular rim (1d) of the cartridge (1) and each possess a means (9d, 13, 23) of positive locking of said catch (9c, 24) on the inside of and under said rim (1d), this positive locking means being actuated directly by the lower part of the central core (4), upon the axial displacement of the latter on the inside of the annular piece (3).
