<ABSTRACT>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION: Equipment for soften from water to private and commercial use. Technical problem: Creation of a water softening plant, which avoids losses on water, which flows through a hardening sensor, and optionally replaced the mechanical control of a multi-way valve by an electrical. The decisive solution point: The outlet of the hardening sensor (26,28) is connected via the multipath valve (24) with a derivative (soft) for softened water and given, the height of the flat free surface (87) of a source resin filling (82) of the hard sensor is preferably by a floating piston (93-95, 112, 115, 121, 132, 135, 141, 173, 132, 135, 141, 173,202), so that an electrical size is influenced by the surface or the floating piston to the multi amount of vegetable Taxes. Main uses: softening of drinking and service water.
