<ABSTRACT>
Current measuring device with a pipe portion arranged within a pipe section, which consists of a voderene, prismatic part and a subsequent cordial extension.In the interior of the prismatic part, two parallel pressure chambers are arranged transversely to the direction of on the road, which are connected via rows of openings or via slots with the back of the prismatic part upper and below the extension and form a pneumatic R-C combination.Pressure transducer for measuring the flow rate per portional periodic pressure fluctuations caused by the vertebral solutions are arranged in or in pressure-conducting connection with the pressure chambers.By means of the R-C combination, the same phase of the wirem solutions is improved over the width of the stink body and the fading is reduced.
