<ABSTRACT>
The method includes the formation of field protection regions (14) under the recessed oxide (12) regions, and a channel surface layer (16) in a silicon substrate (10). A composite mask (SiO₂ layer) (18) is formed, polysilicon layer (20), SiO₂ layer (22), tungsten layer (24) and resin layer (26) according to a desired configuration. By ionic implantation is formed the source (28) and drain (30) regions, which are self-aligned with these layers. The tungsten (24) is cut laterally and partially, a new layer of resin (32) is used which indicates the source side. The region (24) with the profile represented. The effective channel therefore consists of a portion of the region (34) and a portion of the surface layer (16). After oxidation of the structure that forms the regions (36), the contact holes and the metal interconnection network (38) is formed. A slightly different embodiment makes it possible to make the source regions (28) and (34) before the DRAIN region (30). The polysilicon isolated door-to-door transistor thus obtained is characterized by its self-alignment characteristics, reduced dimensions and high operating speed. It can be of general use in all integrated semiconductor circuits, both in logical and analycological applications.
