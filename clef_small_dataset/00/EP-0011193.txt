<ABSTRACT>
For options for selectively transferred from bending seeds and relatively rigid profile cross-sections of conkin-based particulate matter and center steel rolling streets, in which a cooling bed is assigned a cooling bed in two mutually parallel rolling lines of each rolling line and a pivoting movable, which is formed as a casserole roller turning point on section, which is Either enables either from the rolling lines each one cooling bed or each of a rolling line to charge the one or the other rolling bed associated with the one or the other rolling line, for improving the overwearing of the bending-soap profiles, the pointsab section per rolling line (I and II) a side to the side Conveying direction (R) deflectable rolling portion (5, 5a and 25, 25a) arranged in front of the cooling bedside optionally with the head ends of the casserole rollers (15, 15a) in the one or the other rolling line (I and II) is swiveled. The deflectable rolling portion (5, 5a and 25, 25a) is formed as a tilting roller and cooled side by means of a laterally to the conveying direction (R) directed tipping along an arcuate web relative to its inlet-side stationary end from its center position under weighing and deflecting from its longitudinal axis A pivot axis (a) inclined to this along the conveying direction (R) downwardly inclined pivot axis (a) with the head ends of the released frolgers (15, 15a) in the conveying plane of one or the other rolling line (I and ii) pivotable.
