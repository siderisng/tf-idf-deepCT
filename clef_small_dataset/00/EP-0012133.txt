<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a seal for the gap between a circumferential wave and a ge hole. The seal at low speed and at standstill takes over an annular, spring-loaded sealing lip from an elastomeric material. With increasing speed, the contacting of the sealing lip is muted to the mating surface by the action of the centrifugal force and the sealing effect shifts to a dyna mixing sealing flange (3). This rotates with the shaft, and its end face is slidably at a fixed surface facing the sealed medium. The flange (3) has it fully penetrating openings in radial and in the axial direction which are connected as it is. The flange (3) consists of a bonded granules, made of fibers or plates. The sealing effect results from the fact that the deserted medium in the wetted surfaces of the flange, down-sealed medium is deflected by the effective centrifugal force to the outer periphery and conveyed back into the sealed space in a circulation. the proportions of the medium at a relatively lower specific weight, preferably air contained in the medium, have a continuous heat dissipation, lubrication and dynamic sealing of the lubricating end face (20) of the flange (3) and the fixed radial surface (19) .
