<ABSTRACT>
in the method, lengths of wire (9) are drawn from  wire supplies (10) and cut, each end of each cut wire being  stripped of insulation and terminated, and the cut wire then  being laid along a predetermined path defined by guide  pins (4a) on a loom board (3).  the wire lengths are then  bound together and removed from the board.  the wire (9)  is handled by a mechanical gripper (7) which moves and is  actuated under preprogrammed electronic control.  the apparatus comprises a loom board (3) or the  means by which such a loom board can be made, an auto­ matic manipulator having a controlled gripper (7) to draw  wire (9) from a preselected supply (10), a cutter (8) to  cut the wire, a wire stripper and insulative sleeve applica­ tor (16) and a terminal supply and crimper (17), both  accessible to the gripper which can then lay the terminated  wire lengths along predetermined paths on the loom board  (3), and a tape binder (25) which binds the laid wires  together to form the required wiring loom (27).

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a method and apparatus for the production of wiring looms. as used herein, the term wiring loom means a bundle of individually insulated electrical wires, bound or otherwise held together, to be installed in equipment having spaced electrical components to provide the required electrical connections between such components. a major use of such wiring looms is in the manufacture of powered vehicles such as automobiles or industrial trucks. whether powered electrically, or by means of an internal combustion engine, a large number of electrical components require interconnection, and for this purpose one or more such wiring looms are disposed in appropriate channels or recesses, or are otherwise fixed in the vehicle, and the ends of the wires, appropriately precut to the required length and terminated, are connected to the components. the wires usually have different colour insulation to facilitate the correct connection by the fitter of the wires to the components. the looms commonly include wires of a number of different lengths, arranged with various branches projecting from a main central trunk. the production of such looms involves complex procedure, and involves the use of a loom board comprising a board carrying a multiplicity of pins fixed in and projecting from one side of the board, these pins being arranged to define predetermined guide paths along which the wires are laid prior to being bound together. various attempts have been made to render the production of wiring looms or harnesses at least partially automatic. these attempts are illustrated by united states specification no. 3186077 (which proposes the use of an array of pins on a base board and the fixing of the ends of wires to selected pins by means of a clip pusher), no. 3699630 (which proposes the use of a base board with predisposed termination sites) and no. 3842496 (which proposes the use of base boards having predisposed termination sites and guide pegs in predetermined locations). a method which is not of general applicability is illustrated by united states patent no. 4126935, which relates to the production of twisted pairs and proposes the use of mass termination blocks for the wires. a form board into which the pins for defining guide paths are screwed or hammered is shown in united states specification no. 3346020. a looming board is known from the western electric engineer, april 1975, pages 68 to 77, "software controlled forming of local cables", in which a wire feed head is movable in two dimensions over the board for wire laying under computer control. the head is also movable vertically so as in a preliminary operation to enable the drilling of the board, also under computer control, to prepare it to receive a multiplicity of guide pins. although the board can be used to form a multiplicity of different looms simultaneously at different locations on it, it does not permit the pins to be removed and replaced automatically so as to enable different looms to be formed in sequence. according to the

1. a method of producing a multiplicity of wiring looms each constituted  by a bundle of individually insulated  electrical wires of predetermined lengths, the  method employing a board which is adapted to  receive and hold temporarily a multiplicity of  guide pins such that the pins project from a substantially  flat surface and the method employing  an automatic manipulator which moves and  is actuated in accordance with a predetermined  programme of commands, the method  comprising the steps of (i) causing the  manipulator (7) to remove guide pins from a  supply (4) thereof and to place them at predetermined  positions on said board (3) so as to  define a multiplicity of predetermined paths for  the wires of the loom, (ii) causing the manipulator  (7) to grip a selected wire projecting from a  supply thereof, (iii) feeding a predetermined  length (28) of the selected wire to the manipulator,  (iv) cutting the wire to sever the length  thereof, (v) causing the manipulator (7) to  anchor the length of wire at one end and to lay  the length of wire between guide pins (4a)  along a respective one of the predetermined  paths, repeating the steps (ii) to (v) in respect  of a multiplicity of lengths of wire so as to  assemble a bundle of wires, (vi) fastening the  lengths of wire together while they are located  on the board (vii) removing the loom (27)  constituted by said bundle by inverting said  board so that the bundle falls away from the  board, repeating the steps (ii) to (vi)  for each loom to be produced and  (viii) finally releasing and  jettisoning the pins from the  board so as to be ready to receive  guide pins defining the predetermined  wire paths of a different loom batch  to be produced subsequently. 2. a method according to claim 1 in which a  terminal fitting is applied to one end of the  length of wire before the wire is cut, another  terminal fitting being applied to the end resulting  from the cutting. 3. apparatus for making a wire loom,  characterised by the combination of a multiplicity  of guide pins (4a), a substantially flat loom board (3)  adapted to receive and hold temporarily said  guide pins, a feeder (10-14) arranged to present  a plurality of wires (9) each of which can be  drawn from a supply, an automatic manipulator  (7) which is arranged to move and be actuated  in accordance with a predetermined programme  of commands, the manipulator being  programmed to remove said guide pins from a  supply thereof and to place the pins at predetermined  positions on the board so that the  pins project from the surface of the board and  define a plurality of predetermined paths for the  wires of the loom, and the manipulator also  being programmed, on reception of each of a  multiplicity of lengths of said wire, to anchor one  end of each length and to lay the length between  guide pins along a respective one of the  paths, means for fastening the lengths of wire  together to form a bundle while the lengths are  on the board, means for inverting the board  so as to remove the bundle of fastened lengths  from the board, and means for releasing and  settisoning the pins from the board. 4. apparatus according to claim 3 in which  the pins (4a) are double-ended so that either  end can be received and held by the board. 5. apparatus according to either of claims 3  or 7, including means for stripping and applying  a terminal fitting to each end of each length  of wire.
