<ABSTRACT>
in an expanded electrical discharge heater (1) a moveable discharge source is provided with a drive linkage comprising two separately but simultaneously operable linkages, each of which may be a crank (4) motivated arm (5), each linkage being capable of applying a reciprocating movement to the discharge source at an angle to that applied by the other linkage.  by control of the frequency ratio and phase shift between the reciprocating movements complex path patterns of the discharge source may be achieved thereby enabling wear to be more evenly distributed about the discharge source and the heater interior.  a high proportion of the cross-section of the heating chamber (14) may be traversed (15) giving the possibility of an increase in the effective capacity of the heating chamber and of a lengthened residence time in the heating chamber.
