<ABSTRACT>
heterocyclic compounds of the general formula <image> in which r represents alkyl having 4-12 carbon atoms, the alkyl radical optionally being substituted by halogen; cycloalkyl having 3-7 carbon atoms; mono-lower alkyl-substituted cycloalkyl having 4-10 carbon atoms; cycloalkylalkyl having 4-16 carbon atoms; phenyl or aryl-lower alkyl having 7-16 carbon atoms; r1 represents hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, alkoxy having 1-4 carbon atoms or alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; r2 and r3 represent hydrogen or alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; r4,r5 and r6 represent hydrogen or alkyl having 1-8 carbon atoms, where two of the substituents r4, r5 and r6 can in each case be linked to the same carbon atom or together can form a fused alicyclic or aromatic 6-membered ring; x represents a methylene group, an oxygen atom, a carbonyl group or the group <image> in which w and t in each case themselves represent an oxygen or sulphur atom and r7 represents lower alkylene having 2-4 carbon atoms or alkenylene having 4 carbon atoms; or the group <image> in which w' and t' represent an oxygen or sulphur atom and r8 and r9 represent lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms; z denotes the integers 0 or 1 and the dashed bonds can be hydrogenated; with the proviso that if x is present as a methylene group or an oxygen atom, either the substituent r only denotes an alkyl radical having 4-12 carbon atoms which is substituted by halogen, or the substituent r1 is present as hydroxyl, halogen or alkoxy having 1-4 carbon atoms;  and salts of compounds of this type which have basic character.  furthermore a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula i, fungicidal agents which contain these compounds, methods for the preparation of these agents and for their use, and the use of these agents.
