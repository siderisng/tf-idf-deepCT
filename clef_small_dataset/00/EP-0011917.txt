<ABSTRACT>
a printed promotional coupon comprises a multiple-­ product base coupon (21) and a plurality of product stamps  (22).  the product stamps (22) bear markings defining a  coupon redemption value for a particular product purchase.   the coupon acquires value and becomes effective only by  the affixing of one or more stamps (22) onto the base coupon  (21), each at a location which bears markings corresponding  to the associated stamp (22).  the coupon holder can deter­ mine the overall redemption value of the coupon by select­ ing the number of stamps (22) affixed, corresponding to the  number of different products purchased at any retail store  carrying the products.  in one embodiment, the base coupon  (21) and product stamp (22) form a single sheet, with the  product stamps (22) being detachable from the base coupon  (21).  in another embodiment, the product stamps (22) are on  a card or sheet separate from but distributed with the base  coupon (21).
