<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns an apparatus (40) and method for  increasing the fin density of a serpentine sheet (10) having a  plurality of fins (14a, 14b, 14c), each fin having two sides (16,  18) coupled together at one end (20) with a space (22) between  the sides.  blocks (30,32) having recesses (30a, 32a) for receivÂ­ ing the end (20, 24) of one side (16) of a fin (14a) are moved  vertically from opposite sides (a,b) of the sheet (10) into  contact with such ends.  simultaneously, blades (34, 36) are  moved vertically into positions at the other side (18) of the fin  (14a) from opposite sides (a, b) of the sheet.  then, the blades  (34, 36) are moved transversely towards the blocks (30, 32),  which are now held stationary, to compress the fin (14a) a  predetermined amount by moving the other fin side towards  the one fin side.  the blocks and blades are then withdrawn  from the sheet to move another fin (14b) into position for  another compressing operation.
