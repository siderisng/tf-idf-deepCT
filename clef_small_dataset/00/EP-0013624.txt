<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to tanks for the storage of liquid and  has particular application to the land storage of liquefied gas  at low temperature at or above atmospheric pressure.  an object of the invention is to provide a lobed storage tank  based on those described in u. k.  patent specification no.  1  522 609 and u. k.  patent application no.  37247/76, which is  particularly suitable for land storage.  thus, the invention provides a storage tank of the kind in  which the walls are formed by a multiplicity of connected,  paralle, part-cylindrical lobes presenting outwardly convex  arcuate surfaces, which is characterised in that the side and  end walls thereof are provided by a single tier of connected  lobes, in that said lobes extend in one common direction over  the tank, in that the end walls of the tank comprise part-Â­ spherical knuckles closing off the ends of the part-cylindrical  lobes, and in that a separating plate is provided at each lobe  connection to strengthen the tank against internal pressure  and to divide it into separate storage compartments.
