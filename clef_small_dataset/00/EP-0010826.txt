<ABSTRACT>
a method of manufacturing components, such as a  steering wheel hubs, which are adapted to be mounted on  a shaft comprises forcing a tubular insert (20) having a  substantially uniform internal diameter into engagement  with a mandrel having an external surface at least part of  which (29) diverges to a diameter greater than the internal  diameter of the insert, thereby deforming the insert so that  its internal surface is cylindrical at one end and diverges  outwardly towards the other end, moulding a body (30)  around the insert whilst the insert is engaged with the  mandrel, and disengaging the mandrel and the insert.  since  the divergent part of the insert is not formed until imme­ diately before the body of the component is moulded the  number of faulty components having the insert located  therein in an incorrect orientation is reduced.
