<ABSTRACT>
conventional magnetic read/write head (12) reads a  data track on a disk, and the readout signals are processed  in a data processing system (34, 42) to control a voice coil  motor (14) so that the head (12) is forced back and forth  over the track.  sequential samples are obtained by comÂ­ parator (38) detecting that the signal from filter (36) equals  one of a sequence of comparison values from processing  system (34, 42) the current comparison value being  changed when equality has been detected.  the sample  sequence is analysed to detect track crossings, at sample  maxima, and the latter are used with following sample  amplitudes to generate the control for the motor (14).
