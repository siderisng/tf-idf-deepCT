<ABSTRACT>
the device has an exchangeable attachment insert, for example a stimulator or a spiral brush, which can be secured on a shaft grip (1) with an angled receiving end (3), it being possible for the plastic-embedded shaft of the treatment insert (5) to be inserted with clamp fitting into a holding recess in the shaft grip.  the clamp holding is preferably achieved by means of longitudinal bores at both ends of the shaft grip, so that the latter at the same time can be used universally and, with good clamp holding, remains narrow and can therefore also be introduced into all areas of the mouth without difficulties.  <image>
