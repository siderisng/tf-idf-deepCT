<ABSTRACT>
the projector (11) includes two projection optics systems  (14, 15, 17, 18, 20) and two slide gates (25, 27) which move  slides acquired from a slide receptacle into and out of a  viewing position in all of the projection optics systems.  the  slide gates (25, 27) are movable between a first position,  which is common to both slide gates (25, 27) and in which  slides are moved between the slide receptable and wherein  one of the slide gates (25, 27) is positioned there, and the  second position in one of the projection optics systems.   slides move by gravity from the receptacle into a slide gate  (25, 27) at the first position and a slide lifter is provided for  lifting a slide from a slide gate (25, 27) at the first position  back into the receptacle.
