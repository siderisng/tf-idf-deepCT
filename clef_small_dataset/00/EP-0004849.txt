<ABSTRACT>
a lock mechanism particularly for doors having a narrow  stile, wherein a unique arrangement of components provides  greater security and facilitates manufacture and installation,  as characterized by a heavy pivotally swingable main bolt  (24) connected at its inner end to one end of a rocker  actuating lever (42), the end of the lever being provided with  a unique escapement (50) for the release and control of the  movement of the rocker arm by an associated manually  rotatable key-actuated cam extension (68), to move the main  bolt between locked and unlocked positions.  an important  feature of the escapement resides in a unique arrangement  of parts which is not critical as to the dimensions of the  actuating cam extension, and which readily accommodate to  actuating cams that may vary materially in their dimensions.   the escapement also enables a better and more symmetrical  resolution of the operating forces in a manner which  materially contributes to the obtainment of maximum  security.
