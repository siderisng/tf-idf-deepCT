<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a lecithin concentrate which is  readily dispersible into water at 10°c and 10% by weight  concentration to form a stable emulsion therewith charac­ terised in that the concentrate comprises lecithin having an  i. v.  of at least 75 and at least one nonionic emulsifier hav­ ing an hlb of at least 12 selected from polyoxyalkylene  monoglycerides, polyoxyalkylene diglycerides and, the  polyoxyethylene derivatives of partial fatty acid esters and  hexitol anhydride, and in that the emuisifier is homoge­ neously dispersed throughout the concentrate at a level  ranging from about 5 to about 15 parts by weight nonionic  emulsifier for each 100 parts by weight lecithin.  the invention also relates to a method for the prepa­ ration of such a concentrate in which the nonionic emulsi­ fier and the lecithin are blended at elevated temperature  and under mixing conditions sufficient to form a homoge­ neous concentrate of emulsifier and lecithin.  the invention  further relates to a method for forming an aqueous medium  which contains a lecithin of an i. v.  of at least 75, homoge­ neously dispersed and emulsified therein, wherein the  lecithin concentrate defined above is added to an aqueous  medium.
