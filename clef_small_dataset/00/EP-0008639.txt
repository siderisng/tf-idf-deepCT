<ABSTRACT>
1.  light source arrangement in a spotlight for producing coloured light particularly in theater or studio lighting whereby the colour of the light is continuously variable, in which a) three superposed light beams (22, 24, 26) having a short-wave (blue), a medium (green) and a long-wave (red) wave length range are generated, b) each of the light beams (22, 24, 26) emerges from an individual adjustable light source (10, 12, 14), c) two dichroitic filters (32, 34) are provided for the superposition of the light beams (22, 24, 26), c1 ) which filters are disposed inclined with respect to the beam axes and c2 ) the limit wave lengths of which filters correspond to the borderlines between the short-wave and the medium wave length ranges as well as to that between the medium and the long-wave length ranges, respectively, and d) a first light beam (22) is transmitted through both of the dichroitic filters (32, 34), and the second and the third light beams (24, 26) are each reflected by one of the dichroitic filters (32 or 34, respectively), characterized in that e) the light sources (10, 12, 14) are continuously emitting light, f) the intensity of each of the light beams (22, 24, 26) is monitored by a photoelectric detector (64, 66, 68), g) a regulator (70, 72, 74) is provided for the adjustment of each of the light source (10, 12, 14), by means of which regulator the signal of the photoelectric detector (64, 66, 68) is compared to an adjustable desired value and the power of the light source (10, 12, 14) is adjsuted as a function of the result of this comparaison, and h) the adjustable desired values of all light sources (10, 12, 14) are commonly variable in the same proportion to adjust of the total intensity of the exiting light beam.
