<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a coating composition comprising  a polymeric binder component and an aqueous medium  containing, as a colouring component, a dyestuff soluble in  the aqueous medium.  such a coating composition can be  advantageously employed in a combination of coating compositions  embodying the invention which combination is  capable of producing a two-coat system on a surface and  comprises at least a first coating composition which is  water-based, contains a first colouring component and is  capable of providing an undercoating, and a second coating  composition capable of providing the gloss, which second  coating composition is water-based and contains a  polymeric binder component in an amount sufficient to  impart the gloss to the said surface and a second colouring  component (which may be the same as or different from the  first colouring component) which is a dyestuff soluble in the  water.
