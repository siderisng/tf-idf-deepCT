<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of oxan organopolysi compositions by mixing at a temperature of 5 to 180 ° C, of ​​α Ω dihydroxysioropolysiloxanic oils A, Sila Nes B of formula Z (g) Siraq3-A in which Z represents CH₂ = C (R ' ) - COO or HS, G an alkylene, R and R 'radical hydrocarbon radicals, q alkoxyl radicals, has a value ranging from 0 to 2, and catalyst c derivatives of titanium or tin. This process is characterized in that the oils have a viscosity spreading from 70 to 500 MPa. s at 25 ° C, that the oils A and the silanes b are mixed in such a way that the hydroxyl radical molar ratio of the oils Q of the silanes is from 0.1 to 0.95, and that the reagents are kept in contact with contact The time needed to eliminate at most 45% of the theoretical quantity of QH alcohol to form from the oils and radicals Q of the silanes b. The products obtained from this process serve as material, in combination with derivatives of benzoβne, zanthone or thioxanthone for photopolymerizable compositions in antiane antia with solids.
