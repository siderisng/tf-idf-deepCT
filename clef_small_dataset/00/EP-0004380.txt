<ABSTRACT>
a plurality of parallel wires (27) are disposed between  a corona discharge electrode (24) and a surface (13) to be  electrostatically charged.  the surface (13) is moved relative  to the electrode (24) and wires (27).  the wires (27)  are equally spaced from each other in a plane (28) which  is inclined relative to the surface (13) in such a manner that  the spacing between the wires (27) and the surface (13) increases  in the direction of movement of the surface (13)  relative to the wires (27).  a high voltage for corona discharge  is applied to the electrode (24).  a low voltage is  applied to the wires (27) to prevent the surface (13) from  being charged above a predetermined potential.  the low  voltage may be applied to the wires (27) by means of a zener  diode (31) connected between the wires (27) and ground  which prevents a potential induced in the wires (27) from  the electrode (24) from exceeding the zener voltage of the  diode (31).
