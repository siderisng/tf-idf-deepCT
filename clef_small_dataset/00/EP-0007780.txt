<ABSTRACT>
a fibre optic branching coupler for a fibre optics comÂ­ munications system and which comprises three or more  lengths of image conduit (11,) connected to extend  individually between respective pairs of input/output ports  (12).  these ports are formed by converging the end portions  of two or more image conduit lengths so that their faces are  juxtaposed in coplanar relationship.  the composite end face  at each port has an image-splitting centre (13) with which is  aligned the optical fibre connected to the port.  the term  "image conduit" is employed in accordance with convention  in the art, as explained in the specification.

<DESCRIPTION>
fibre optic-branching coupler this invention relates to a fibre optic branching coupler for use in a fibre optic communications system wherein the light signal carried in a single fibre is to be split between two or more information carrying fibres or, conversely, wherein the signals carried in two or more fibres are to be combined into a composite signal to be carried in a single fibre. various devices have been proposed for fibre optic coupling in order to split a light signal or combine two or more signals. for example, reference is made to applied optics vol. 15, no. 9, at pages 2031/2, optics communications vol. 17, no. 1, at pages 129-132. these and other known devices either utilise lens and prism system for splitting the light signal or involve the production of delicate structures tailored to one particular fibre diameter in an arrangement suitable for light splitting. it is an object of the invention to provide a different kind of device for fibre optic coupling. according to the invention, there is provided a fibre optic branching coupler which comprises three or more lengths of coherent fibre image conduit arranged in fixed relationship so that said lengths individually extend between respective pairs of input/output ports, each input/output port being formed at the junction of the end portions of two or more of the image conduit lengths, which are converged together so that their end faces are juxtaposed in coplanar relationship, the cross-section of the image conduit being such that the said juxtaposed end faces at mach port define an image splitting centre with respect to an optical fibre to be connected to the port. thus, the invention differs from the prior art in that image conduit is employed to enable the required coupling to be effected. in the present specification and claims, the term "coherent fibre image conduit, sometimes known as "coherent fibre optic rod", is used conventionally, more specifically to refer to a solid conduit or rod-like material which is constituted by a large number of very small individual fibres whose spatial coherence is maintained from the input to the output such that the conduit or rod has the property of transmitting an image from input to output, and vice versa. in the present invention, the image conduit is used for light splitting to split an image of the incoming fibre, the split images being carried coherently to the output ports. for combining light signals, the image conduit acts to combine the images of two or more incoming fibres. various physical arrangements of the branch coupler are possible to suit the many types of coupling which may be required in a fibre optics communication system or optical fibre data bus system. furthermore, it is to be appreciated that the coupler may not only be employed when an image of an incoming fibre is to be split equally between two or more output ports, or the signals from two or more incoming fibres are to be equally combined into a
