<ABSTRACT>
the refractory cores, which have a porosity of at least  25% by volume and a modulus of rupture of at least 60 kilog­ rams per square centimetre, are formed from a particulate  material predominantly comprising vitreous silica grains  bonded together by crystalline silica formed in situ at the  grain boundaries in an amount of not more than 30% by  weight of the core.  the cores are made from a mixture com­ prising an organic binder, a mineralizer and refractory parti­ cles (at least 40% of the latter having a particle size of at least  50 microns and at least 20% of the refractory particles being  vitreous silica particles of size 1 to 30 microns) by shaping the  mixture, firing at at least 1000°c to form crystalline silica in the  amount specified above, and cooling.  the cores are used for  casting ferrous alloys at at least 1500°c.
