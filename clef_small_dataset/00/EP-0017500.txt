<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a process for the separation of a  strong mineral acid from other species present in an  aqueous solution and the recovery thereof.  the process  comprises the steps of:   (a) bringing an aqueous solution containing the miner­ al acid to be separated into contact with a substantially  immiscible extractant phase, whereupon the mineral acid to  be separated selectively and reversibly transfers to the  extractant phase;   (b) separating the two phases; and   (c) backwashing the extractant phase with an aqueous  system to recover substantially all the mineral acid contained  in the extractant phase.  the extractant phase used comprises  a strong organic acid which acid is oil soluble and substan­ tially water immiscible both in free and in salt form, an oil  soluble amine which amine is substantially water insoluble  both in free and in salt form and a carrier solvent for the  organic acid and amine, the molar ratio of the organic acid to  amine in the extractant phase being between about 0. 5:2 and  2:0. 5.
