<ABSTRACT>
a molecularly-oriented two-part extrusion is made by  extruding a second part (7) into thermal and mechanical  engagement with a first part (3) already extruded, cooled and  advanced at a speed restricted by a gripping device (5).  the  product is taken up at a higher speed, to effect elongation.  at  least one of the parts is of a crystallisable polymeric material,  and elongation takes place at a point between the extruder (6)  and the take-up where, as a result of cooling of the second part  and or the concurrent heating of the first, it is at a tempera­ ture between its glass transistion temperature between its  crystalline melting point.  both parts may be of crystallisable  polymeric material and at such a temperature when elonga­ tion takes place.  they may be inner and outer layers drawn  down during elongation onto a wire or other core.
