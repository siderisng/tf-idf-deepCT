<ABSTRACT>
gear-type machine (pump or motor) with two gear pairs (24 and 25) connected hydraulically in parallel, arranged axially in relation to one another, separated from one another by an intermediate plate (30) and with straight-toothed or obliquely toothed gears (28,29 and 26,27) which mesh in external engagement or internal engagement without or virtually without backlash and the gear shafts (16,21) of which are rotatably mounted in bearing bodies (12,13,17,18) arranged in the housing or in bearing bushes (14,15,19,20) arranged in the housing and/or housing cover, characterised in that viewed in the centre of the gear, the toothing of the two gears (27,29 and 26,28) arranged on a gear shaft (16,21) is mutually offset by one quarter of the tooth pitch in the circumferential direction.  <image>
