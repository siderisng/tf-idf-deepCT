<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing a fibrous sheet by paper, according to which the flocculant is introduced into the aqueous suspension containing the basic mixture selected from the assembly constituted by (i) the fibers alone whenThere is no non-binding mineral charge, and (ii) the fibers and non-bonding mineral filler when it is present, before and after the introduction of the organic binder.It also concerns as the new undue product the sheet obtained according to this method.Finally, it relates to the application of said nomore sheet in the field of coatings (replacing asbestos) and print-written media.
