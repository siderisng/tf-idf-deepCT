<ABSTRACT>
a semi-trailer landing gear speed reduction mechanism  is provided which includes two horizontally disposed parallel  spaced shafts with one shaft (32) being rotated by a manual  crank means (38) and the other shaft (40) connected to a  mechanism for raising and lowering the landing gear.  a two  speed ratio for the mechanism is provided by having a fixed  pair of gears (44, 46) secured to the driven shaft (40), a pinion  gear (50) fixed to driving shaft (32) and a gear (52) having  both internal and external threads (54 and 56) supported on  its internal threads (54) on the driving shaft and in engagement  with a pinion gear (46) on the driven shaft.  the drive  shaft (32) is axially shiftable between a first position in which  the last said gear (52) is free to rotate about the driving shaft  and the pinion gear (50) secured to the driving shaft is in  driving engagement with a gear (44) on the driven shaft (40),  and a position in which the pinion gear (50) on the driving  shaft is in engagement with the internal threads (54) on the  floating gear (52) which in turn drivingly engages with its  external threads (56) the pinion gear (46) secured to the  driven shaft.
