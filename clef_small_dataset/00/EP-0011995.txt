<ABSTRACT>
a contaminated air stream from a textile operation which  includes lint, short fibers, dust and other small particles is  subjected to a progressive or multi-stage filter system, in  which a first stage (i) includes a rotary drum filter (20) covered  with a fine mesh screen covering which separates the lint and  long fibers from the short fibers and dust which are carried on  to a second stage.  at the second stage filter (ii), which is also a  rotary drum filter (38) but covered with a media type filter  material, the short fibers are separated.  the remaining dust  and very small particles are passed on to a third stage (iii)  which is also a rotary drum filter (54) covered with a media of  even greater density than the second stage.  each of the rotary drum filters are provided with suction  nozzles (22, 40, 42, 56, 58) or other vacuum cleaning apparatus  some of which are selectively moveable radially of the drum  into close proximity to the surface of the filter for the purposes  of periodic cleaning thereof and to a removed position in  situations of non-cleaning.  others are stationary.  only one set  of the nozzles are cleaning at any one particular time, which  cleaning sequence is controlled by a control circuit which  utilizes a photohelic differential pressure switch.  the control  circuit provides suction as required resulting from both  movement of the first stage nozzle toward and away from the  surface of the filter, and the operation of a damper (26,50,62)  downstream from all nozzles which is slowly opened and  closed by the control circuit.  finally, the diametrical upstream ends (39) of the second  and third stage filters are covered with media also to provide  an increased filtering area in addition to the conventional  peripheral filter surfaces.
