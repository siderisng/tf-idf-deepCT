<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutting set for an electromotive driven device for crushing foods consisting of two concentrically arranged and relatively opposing cutting rings (6) and (7) with axially directed teeth (10) forming between axial slots (9) forming teeth (10).Those at least one of the two cutting rings in each case of a hard metal o. Like. Existing cutting profile (11) is attached.As a new is considered primarily that each cutting profile is plate-shaped and the tooth associated with it is completely engaged on its side facing the annular gap between the two cutting rings, the one of the two axial edges of the cutting profile lying on said annular gap (12)While the other axial edge (13) forms a cutting gap (14) together with the cutting edge of the following cutting profile.
