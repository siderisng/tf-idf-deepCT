<ABSTRACT>
in radar apparatus, to reduce long range clutter and chaff  returns, a bistatic radar system is used with spaced directional  transmitting and receiving antennae (10, 12 in figure 1), the  directional patterns overlapping but with the null 18 on one  side of one directional pattern being substantially parallel to  the null 19 on the other side of the other directional pattern  whereby signals from targets, clutter, etc.  beyond a pre­ determined range ro dependent on the directional patterns  and antenna spacing are substantially reduced.  the invention  is particularly applicable to short range radars with a high  repetition rate and especially to radars with moving target  indication.

<DESCRIPTION>
"radar arp@ratus having spaced transmitting and receiving antennae" this invention relates to radar apparatus and is concerned @ore particularly with reducing the effects of long range clutter in a short range radar. for ç surveillance radar the operating frequency usually has to be chosen as a compromise. a low frequency is desirable to give good anti-clutter performance an mti (moving target indication) mode whereas a high frequency enables a narrow beam width to be obtained thereby improving the performance under conditions of jamming. a particular problem which occurs @n short range radars is that, although the limitation to a short range might be considered a@ permitting the use of a high prf (pulse repetition frequency), thereby improving the rate of data i@put and hence the performance, this perrormance may be des@roye@ by long range clutter returns which appear as s@@ond and third time round echoes, that is to say clutter returns from ranges grcater than the range corresponding to the false repetition period. chaff is particularly troublesome since the velocity spreading on such long range echoes may be an order greater than the spreading on chaff returns within the nominal range bracket of the radar thus operation in an mti mode may not be effective in eliminating clutter from stationary ci slowmoving targets, such a- chaff, at long ranges. according to on aspect of the invention, there is provided bistatic radar apparatus having spaced directional transmitting and receiving scanning antennae with directional patterns squinting inwardly to overlap in a region of interest but to reduce signals from distant targets. the directional patterns and squinting are preferably such as to give a substantial reduction in the overall radar gain for distant targets, for example, by at least 70 db. the expression "istan targets" includes not only ships, aircraft and like mowing objects but also chaff and ground clutter. the present invention is particularly concerned with a short range radar and, by the above technique, the effect of responses from long range targets is reduced or eliminated. according to another aspect of the invention, in radar apparatus having a transmitter feeding a transmitting antenna providing a main beam which is directional in a horizontal plane and a receiver fed from a receiving antenna hiving a main beam which is also directional in a horizontal plane, the transmitting and receiving antennae are spaced apart horizontally with the main beams squinting inwardly to overlap in a region to one side of the line between the two antennae, the beams being so directed that a null on one side of the main beam from one antenna is substantially parallel to a null on the other side of the main beam of the other antenna. with this arrangement, the transmiting and receiving beams are arranged to intersect in the region of interest. at ranges beyond this region, because the transmitting and receiving beams do not overlap, signals from distant targets are significantly attenuated compared with a conventitnal radar using coincident transmitting and receiving beams. by making
