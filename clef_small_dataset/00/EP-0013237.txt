<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the manufacture of fibers, from a stretch material, such as the melted glass, by stretching by means of gaseous current.It essentially consists in generating, remotely and towards a main gaseous stream (b) at least one gaseous jet (J), a smaller dimension that penetrates the main neck for creating an area of interaction, atPreventing the induction of ambient gas streams on one side of each jet by means of a protective screen (16) having a straight portion along the trajectory of the jet towards the main current PAL, and to bring the material (G) In the form of a net to the stretch condition, in the gases induced by each jet on the opposite side on the screen so as to introduce each net into an area of Inte Race where it is transformed into fibers.
