<ABSTRACT>
polymer product, such as a polyester resin, is recovered  in finely divided form from a polymer product/solvent solu­ tion by the addition of the solution to a hot, non-boiling water  phase with non-shearing agitation of the resulting composi­ tion of the water, polymer product, and solvent under condi­ tions which give rise to turbulence in the composition.  the  solvent, which has a lower boiling point than the temperature  at which the hot water is maintained, boils off from the  polymer product, solvent, and water composition and leaves  the desired, finely divided, polymer product admixed in the  water phase.  the product can be recovered by filtration or  other suitable separation technique.
