<ABSTRACT>
novel 2-substituted -1h-phenanthro [9,10-d]imidazoles  of the formula    wherein n preferably is 2; r₁ preferably cf₃ of cf₂cf₂h; r₂  preferably is h; x₁ and y₁ preferably are independently  selected from the group consisting of h, f, cl and och₃,  provided, however, that both cannot be h; x₂ and y₂ prefer­ ably are h; are useful as antiinflammatory agents.  processes for their preparation are described.  e. g. 4,5-bis  (4-fluorophenyl)imidazole by photocyclization gave 6,9-­ difluoro-1h-phenanthro [9,10-d]imidazole; this compound by  treating with sulfur in sulfolane gave 6,9-difluoro-­ 1h-phenanthro [9,10-d]imidazole-2-thiol; this compound by  addition of tetrafluoroethylene gave 6,9-difluoro-2- [(1,1,2,2,-­ tetrafluoroethyl)thio] -1h-phenenthro [9,10-d] imidazole;  and this compound was oxidized using  m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to give 6,9-difluoro-2- [1,1,2,2,-­ tetrafluoroethyl) sulfonyl] -1h-phenanthro [1,10-d]  imidazole.

<DESCRIPTION>
title antiinfla*xa.toro' 2-substituted-1h phenanthro [9, l0-d iidazoles background of the invention this invention is directed to a novel class of phenanthro-imidazole compounds and to the use of those compounds as antiinflammatory agents. there is a continuing need for safe and effective anti-inflammatory agents. inflammation is a disease process characterized by redness, fever, swelling, and pain. arthritis, in its various forums, is the most prevalent, chronic, and severe of the inflammatory diseases. traumatic injury and infection also involve inflammation, and antiinflammatory drugs are often used in their treatment. the usefulness of most commercial anti-inflammatories is limited because of toxicity and adverse side-effects. many produce gastric irritation and other effects, such as changes in blood cells and central nervous system. adreno-cortical steroids produce gastric irritation and suppression of normal adrenal function. the journal of the american medical association, vol. 224, no. 5 (supplement), 1973 tprimer on the rheumatic diseases" states that "immunologic reactions appear to play a major role in the perpetuation of rheumatoid inflammation." widely used non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, indomethacin, 1 1 1 1 phenylbutazone and ibuprofen have no effect on these immunologic reactions, but merely relieve the symptoms of the inflanmatory response; these drugs do not stop the progressive and ultimately destructive processes of rheumatoid arthritis. immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but are too toxic for widespread use. the present invention results from efforts to develop new anti-arthritic compounds with good anti inflammatory and immunoregulatory activity and minimal side effects that could be more effective in treating arthritis than presently available drugs. in addition to antlinflammatory properties, compounds within the scope of tis invention have demonstrated analgesic activity in a test procedure. this additional property is desirable in treatment of arthritis or related diseases; however, the compounds which exhibit this property can be employed solely to alleviate pain. brief summary of the invention the invention is therefore directed to a novel class of 2-substituted-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazoles corresponding to the formula: emi2.1 wherein n = 0-2 r1 = -cf2h, -cf3 or -cf2chmf3¯m in which m = 0-3 r2 = -h, emi3.1 2-tetrahydropyranyl, 2-tetrahydrofuranyl, emi3.2 emi3.3 r3 = = -e or -oh3; emi3.4 benzyl, -ch2ch2och3 or r5 = c1¯4 alkyl or benzyl; x1 and y1 are independently selected from the group consisting of -h, -f, -c1, dimethylamino and c1-2 alkoxy; x2 and y2 are independently selected from the group consisting of -h, -f and -c1; y3 is -h, -f, -c1, -br, cl4 alkyl, c1¯4 alkoxy or -no2; ; and, when r2 = -h, a pharmaceutically suitable acid salt when n = 0 or pharmaceutically suitable metal salts when n = 1-2. the invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing the above-described compounds and to the method of using them as anti-inflammatory agents. lombardino, in u.s. patent 3,707,475 discloses 1 1 anti-inflammatory 4,5-diaryl-2-substituted imidazoles. doebel, in u.s. patents 3,505,350 and 3,651,080, respectively, discloses anti-inflammatory 4-alkyl-5aryl-l-substituted-2-mercapto imidazoles and 4-alkyl-2alkylthio-5-aryl-l-substituted imidazoles. zauer, k., et al,, in chem. ber. 106, 1638 (1973), disclose 4,5-bis (4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylthioimidazole
