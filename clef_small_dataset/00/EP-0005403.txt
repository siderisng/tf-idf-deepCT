<ABSTRACT>
The monomode oscillator in microwave, tunable by variation of a magnetic field, uses the propagation of magnetostatic waves on the surface of a magnetic material.The oscillator comprises two different length delay lines formed on the surface of the magnetic material, one of which is common and materialized by a transducer (3), each of the other extremities being materialized by a second (41) and a thirdtransducer (42).The two lines are looped through a single amplifier (7).The choice of the two lengths makes it possible to obtain the deviation between modes, so that there is a single oscillation mode included in the bandwidth of the transducers, in a predetermined range of chord.Application to devices requiring a signal whose frequency is of the order of 2 GHz and can vary from several hundred MHz, such as radar, measuring devices.
