<ABSTRACT>
in a rotary turret-type machine, in which operations  are performed on successive can body cylinders (8, 12) or  the like by a mandrel (59, 159) inside the workpiece co­ operating with a beading rail (76, 176), each workpiece (8,  12) is guided smoothly into a cradle (51, 151) which so sup­ ports and locates it throughout its stay in the machine that  axial movement of the mandrel (59, 159) is unnecessary.   each cradle (51, 151) is reciprocated towards and away  from the mandrel (59, 159) by a fixed cam (45, 145).  each  cradle (51, 151) has a spring loaded support roller permitting  eccentric support of the can body during beading.  each  mandrel (159) preferably has a quick-acting coupling (200)  permitting temporary radial displacement of the mandrel  (159) without loss of parallelism to accomodate a can body  side seam.  this coupling (200) consists of a spring mounted  support plate engaging a register plate through three balls  mounted in seats in the rings to give radially-yielding tripod  support.
