<ABSTRACT>
a composition of matter comprising di-n-butyl-magne­ sium and dimethylmagnesium, to the exclusion of dialkyl­ magnesium compounds containing alkyl groups other than  n-butyl or methyl, with an n-butyl:methyl aikyl group ratio  of about 0. 2:1 to about 5:1 which is soluble in aliphatic,  cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents is dis­ closed.  the composition is prepared in the substantial ab­ sence of oxygen and moisture by the simultaneous or con­ secutive reactions of methyl and n-butyl halides with metallic  magnesium in the presence of the hydrocarbon solvent,  followed by separation of the insoluble magnesium chloride  and any unreacted magnesium metal from the resulting  solution.
