<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for continuously extruding, biaxially orienting  and intermittently forming molded products from a web of thermoplastic  material and further continuously separating the products from the web  selvage, stacking and handling the products and recycling the web  selvage for further extrusion.  the method and apparatus use intermittent  molding devices into which configuration the biaxially oriented web is  interfaced by a continuous-to-intermittent interfacing structure which  preserves the dimensional and orientational integrity of the web and  maintains thermal stability therein.  an undulating peripheral surface  on a dynamic storage or accumulator drum and associated transfer rollers  cooperate with intermittently advanced feed belts in timed relationship  with a reciprocating forming press to effectuate the interface and  product forming portions of the process.  in some of the preferred  embodiments the inertia at the interface between the undulating  peripheral surface of accumulator drum and biaxial orientation apparatus  is reduced to an optimal minimum.
