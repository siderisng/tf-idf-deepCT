<ABSTRACT>
a cartridge type vehicle steering column lock has at the  inner end of the barrel (19) a cam (28) for driving the bolt (16)  from a locking position to a releasing position.  the bolt (16)  includes a sleeve portion (24) which surrounds the barrel (19)  and the cam (28) has a surface (23) which lies outside the  circumference of the barrel (19) and faces towards the sleeve  portion (24).  a leaf spring (26) anchored in the sleeve portion  (24) is engageable with this surface (23) to hold the bolt (16) in  its releasing position when the barrel (19) is rotated towards  the key-insertion position after having been turned to withdraw  the bolt (16) to the releasing position.  in the key-insertion  position of the barrel (19), the leaf spring (26) overlies  an opening (27) in the cam (28) and the bolt (16) is then  held in its releasing position until the key is withdrawn by  co-operation between a pawl (32) on the bolt (16) and a slider  (31) mounted in the barrel (19) to project radially therefrom  whilst the key is present.
