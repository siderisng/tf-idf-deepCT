<ABSTRACT>
a pacemaker pulse generator for producing timing  signals for atrial stimulation on line 71 and ventricular  stimulation on line 60 comprises a ramp generator 30,39 and  a reference voltage generator 15, 21, 22, 23, 24.  when the  ramp voltage 40 reaches the reference voltage 25, comparaÂ­ tor 42 resets ramp generator 30 via transistors 46 and 53 and  produces a ventricular timing signal.  potentiometer 22  adjusts the reference voltage and hence ventricular rate.  the forward voltage drop of diode 62 produces a fixed  offset voltage from ramp 40 and a variable portion of the  offset is picked off by potentiometer 61 to produce a second  (offset) ramp on line 67.  when the offset ramp 67 reaches the  reference voltage 25, comparator 70 produces the atrial  timing signal 71.  varying potentiometer 61 varies the a-v  delay between signals 71 and 60 independently of the  ventricular rate.  in a demand-type pacemaker, the ramp generator may  be reset by a sensed natural heartbeat supplied by a sense  amplifier to terminal 80.

<DESCRIPTION>
rate and a-v delay generator for heart pacemaker technical field of the invention the present invention pertains to the field of artificial heart pacemakers, and more particularly to generating circuits for providing the timing pulses for atrial and ventricular stimulation pulses in an atrial-ventricular (a-v) sequential pacemaker. more specifically, the present invention pertains to an improved rate and a-v timing generator that permits rate and a-v delay interval to be independently adjusted by their own separate controls, which controls have no substantial interaction with each other. background of the prior art it is generally necessary to provide some means for adjusting the pacing rate in an artificial heart pacemaker so as to tailor the operation of the device to the needs of the patient. in the case of an a-v sequential pacemaker, it is also generally necessary to provide some means for adjusting the delay interval between the atrial and ventricular stimulation pulses. implantable pacemakers present their ovm problems in achieving these adjustment functions, and numerous techniques have been developed in the prior art to meet these needs. in the case of external heart pacemakers, in which the generating and control circuitry is in a device external of the body connected by electrode leads which pass through the skin to the patient's heart, control of pacing rate, a-v delay and possibly other operating parameters is generally accomplished by control knobs on the front panel of the device. through the use of these controls the physician can adjust the timing parameters of the pacemaker to meet the patients needs. however, external a-v sequential pacemakers in the prior art are subject to certain unwanted interactions between the control for rate and the control for a-v delay, in that changing the control knob setting for one control not only changes the intended timing function, but also causes an unwanted change in the other parameter. it has long been recognized in the prior art that the basic heart beat rate to be maintained by an a-v pacemaker must be with reference to the ventricular beats, either spontaneous or stimulated, and not by reference to the atrial stimulation. this has caused certain complications in the design of satisfactory rate and a-v delay generating circuits. if it were possible simply to reference basic rate to the atrial pulses, it would be a simple matter to provide circuits to time out a first interval for the atrial-to-atrial rate, and a second shorter interval following an atrial pulse to provide the a-v delay interval, and the two time intervals could easily be independently controllable. however, it has been recognized that such a system would lead to variable or erratic heart rate, because of the uncertainty in practice as to whether the ventricle may depolarize following a stimulated atrial depolarization but before the pacemaker would provide a ventricular stimulation output pulse. since this situation can change from beat to beat, the time interval between successive ventricular depolarizations would vary by a certain amount under such a system, and this
