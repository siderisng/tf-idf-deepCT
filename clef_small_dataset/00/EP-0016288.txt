<ABSTRACT>
to minimise the power absorbed by a positive displace­ ment pump system used where the requirement for pressure  fluid varies inversely with the pump speed, notably in auto­ mobiles, the system provides two separate delivery passages  (61, 62) for the pumped fluid and a discharge passage (66) into  which the fluid from the delivery passage is passed under the  control of a valve means (70, 71), the valve means commenc­ ing to operate on one (62) of the two delivered flows at lower  speeds to by-pass a proportion of said one flow to an overspill  (79), whilst the fluid not bypassed is added to the flow from  the other delivery passage being passed to the discharge  passage.  the said proportion is increased in a manner to  maintain the pressure drop across a discharge orifice in the  discharge passage (66) at a constant value, and as the pump  speed increases further the valve means commences to by­ pass also an increasing proportion of the flow from said other  delivery passage (61) to the overspill to maintain the said  pressure drop constant.  the increase in area of communica­ tion between the second delivery passage and overspill is  greater than the increase in area of communication between  the first delivery passage and overspill.  in this way, the final  regulation is carried out on a smaller quantity of fluid and less  fluid is pumped to the highest pressure in the system.
