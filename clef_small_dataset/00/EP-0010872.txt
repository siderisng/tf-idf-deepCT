<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a process for the pro­ duction of physiologically-useful α-aminophosphonic acids  and peptide derivatives of the formula:    wherein r and r₁ may be the same or different and each  can be hydrogen, deuterium or an optionally substituted  lower alkyl group, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, cycloalkyl,  aryl or heterocyclic radical containing one or more oxygen,  nitrogen or sulphur atoms and which may be fused to an  aromatic ring, a lower alkyl group substituted by a cyclo­ alkyl radical, a lower alkyl group substituted by an aryl  radical, a lower alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclic  radical as defined above or r and r₁ together form a  polymethylene chain optionally interrupted by an oxygen,  nitrogen or sulphur atom, or r₁ represents, together with  the c(r)-n< residue to which it is attached, the atoms  required to complete a heterocyclic radical; and r₂ can be  hydrogen, optionally substituted lower alkyl, cycloalky, aryl  or lower alkyl substituted by a cycloalkyl radical; lower  alkyl substituted by a heterocyclic radical containing one  or more nitrogen atoms; by a heterocyclic radical contain­ ing one or more nitrogen atoms, or r₂ together with the  c(h)-n residue to which it is attached, may represent the  atoms required to complete a heterocyclic radical; and n  is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; comprising oxidising, using an oxidising  agent, a compound having the formula:    wherein r, r¹,  r² and n have their previous significance,  and z is h or a protecting group- usually used for an amino  group; and then removing any protecting group.
