<ABSTRACT>
a dynamic cooler apparatus is provided for dynamically  cooling molten plastic extrudate while pumping metered  amounts of that extrudate to an extrusion die or the like.  the  dynamic cooler apparatus (100) utilizes bi-helical gears (ga,  gb) in a gear pump configuration in a housing in which a heat  exchange medium is circulated.  the heat exchange medium  is also circulated internally of the gears so that the gear teeth  (gat, gbt) and the housing act to cool discrete volumes of  extrudate from four sides defined by the gear teeth and the  internal surface of the housing.  the bi-helical gears (ga, gb)  are driven to minimize loading between the teeth (gat, gbt)  thereof and to permit the teeth (gat, gbt) to be as small as  practical to present more cooling surface for a given crossÂ­ section of extrudate and optimize the heat transfer capability  of the dynamic cooler apparatus.  provision is also made to  use the molten extrudate as a lubricant for the shafts (sa, sb)  and bearings (sab, sbb) of the bi-helical gears.
