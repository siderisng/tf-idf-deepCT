<ABSTRACT>
compositions for textile treatment comprising an  admixture of:   a) an aqueous emulsion based on a copolymer of a  monomeric mixture containing 0. 5 to 50 %, preferably 2 to  40 % and most preferably 4 to 30 % by weight of an  oxirane-containing monoethylenically unsaturated ma­ terial, and at least one other monoethylenically unsatur­ ated material and   b) a water soluble or water dispersible polyamine  which is comprised of at least one segment of formula a,  consisting of repeating alkylenimine units (-ch-ch-n-):    wherein r₁ and r₂ are independently selected from hydro­ gen and lower alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, r₃ is  h or other polyalkylene polyamine segments of formula a,  and n is a number having an average value of at least 2  when r₃ is h, and is taken to be the sum of all alkylen­ imine units when r₃ is other than h.  the compositions may be used at low application le­ vels so that wool-containing textiles in particular may be  rendered shrink-resistant without impairment to their  handle, colour, strength or to other desirable properties  of the fibre.
