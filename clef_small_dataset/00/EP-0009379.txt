<ABSTRACT>
the invention seeks to provide an escape installation  for emergency evacuation of a person or persons from an  exit opening (12) in, for example, a building (13).  the inÂ­ vention provides an escape slide assembly (14) which is  mounted at the exit opening (12) for pivotal movement  about a horizontal axis from a closed position in which the  escape slide assembly (14) closes the exit opening (12)  to an open position in which an inflatable escape slide (28)  is inflated and deployed to provide a slideway leading from  the exit opening (12) to a surface beneath the exit opening  (12).  as well as being used in buildings (13), the escape  installation can be used in ships or aircraft.
