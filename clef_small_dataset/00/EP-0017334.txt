<ABSTRACT>
a solar panel module (10) is provided, wherein a  plurality of solar panels (20) are electrically interconnected  and supported within a low cost frame assembly (14), which  may conveniently be formed from wood products.  each solar  panel (20) is provided with extending conductors for electric­ al connections with adjacent solar panels.  the desired solar  panel is formed in a backwall configuration where solar  radiation is incident on the transparent vitreous substrate.   the panel surface opposite the substrate is sealed, prefer­ ably with a bituminous material, to minimize permeation of  the solar panel by environmental elements.  the sealing  material cooperates with the frame to provide an insulated  exposed surface.  in one embodiment, the completed module  is formed to external dimensions generally standard in the  building industry for easy installation.
