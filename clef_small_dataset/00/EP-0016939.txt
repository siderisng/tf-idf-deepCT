<ABSTRACT>
a napping machine for raising a nap on a fabric or  textile(t) comprises a drawing roll (15) for drawing the  fabric or textile(t) between top napping rolls (4) and bot­ tom napping rolls (4).  each napping roll is rotably moun­ ted on eccentrics mounted on rotably drive shafts.  as the  fabric is drawn between the napping rolls the napping rolls  oscillate by virtue of the eccentrics.  a napping machine as described may be much smal­ ler than prior proposed machines, providing a superior  napping treatment with a minimum of wasted fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
"a napping xachine't this invention relates to a napping machine comprising rolls which act on a textile fabric to raise a nap. the invention also relates to a method of napping a fabric or textile ith napping rolls to raise a nap. it is known in connection with the manufacture of textiles or fabrics to use napping machines çhich tear at the yarns making up the textile or fabric so that some of the fibres of the actual yarns are torn up so as to give the fabric furry or woolly appearance and a very soft feel. this form of treatment is very useful for certain textiles or fabrics, such as for example, those to be used for the production of blankets. conventional napping machines are very bulky and complex and operate unsatisfactorily. a typical conventional napping machine comprises a very large drum on the periphery of which a large number of napping rolls are mounted. each napping roll is provided with hooks or prongs on the outer periphery thereof. in use of the napping machine a textile or fabric to be napped is drawn around the periphery of the drwn and the napping rolls rotate so that the hooks or prongs act on the fabric or textile. thus the fabric is acted on by the napping rolls which raise a nap on the surface of the fabric closest to the large drum. the napping is thus given just to one side of the textile or fabric as the textile or fabric advances. in the use of such prior napping machines the textile or fabric has to travel a long distance and the usual practice is to provide two such napping machines in cascade so that both sides of the fabric or textile can be napped. it is common practice for the textile or fabric to be passed through the two napping machines than once. in practice large premises are required to accomodate two napping machines as described above and considerable energy is consumed in operating the napping machines to provide a satisfactory napping effect. it will be appreciated that napping, as at present carried out, is not ideal so far as the actual processing machinery is concerned and the mechanism by which the process is carried out is also not ideal. the e hooks or prongs of the teasing rolls tear rather than gently extract the fibres from the yarns, leading to considerable waste and heavy losses of valuable fibre material. also problems arise in connection with the removal of the waste fibres that become tapped in the hooks or prongs and fibres that become discharged into the local environment. problems of environmental health can arise where fibres are discharged into the air. in use of many prior proposed napping machines a considerable percentage of the fibres treated are removed form the fabric. the present invention seeks to reduce or obviate the above described disadvantages of prior napping machines. in a napping machine in accordance with the invention there
