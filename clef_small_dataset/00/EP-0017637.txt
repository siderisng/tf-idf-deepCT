<ABSTRACT>
a conveyor comprising an endless chain (15) which runs  on slide ribs (26, 27) and is guided by lateral guide profiles  (13, 14) carried by cross-bridges (40) which are mutually  spaced longitudinally of the conveyor.  each crossbridge  comprises an uppermost bridge portion (10a) and a lower­ most bridge portion (10b), which may be clamped together  to receive and clamp the lateral guide profiles between them.   to afford a simple design and easy mounting the uppermost  bridge portions (10a) have a lateral chamfer (16, 17) at the  lower edge, whereas the lowermost bridge portions (10b)  are provided with upstanding edge flanges (18, 19), so that  slots are formed between the lateral chamfers and the edge  flanges.  these slots are adapted to receive obliquely inward­ ly-downwardly directed tongues (20, 21) of the lateral guide  profiles (13, 14) will be clamped to the cross-bridges, as  these components are clamped together.

<DESCRIPTION>
conveyor. the present invention relates to a conveyor, comprising and endless chain, preferably with the links designed as so called universal joint links, and the necessary drive- and guide means for the chain. the object of the invention has been to provide a conveyor of the indicated kind which is simple and comparatively inexpensive in manufacture but nevertheless is highly reliable in operation. another object of the invention has been to provide a conveyor of the indicated type which comprises a small number of components and is easily adaptable to requirements in each particular case. to meet the above mentioned requirements the conveyor according to the present invention has been designed so as is defined in principle is the characterizing clause of claim 1. advantageous modifications and alterations as to details are defined in the subclaims and in the following specification with reference to the embodiments as shown in the drawing. the invention will be disclosed in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. fig. 1 is a cross- section of one embodiment of the conveyor according to the invention, chosen as example; fig. 2 is a cross-section of a second embodiment of the convenyor according to the invention, designed with a return path for the conveyor chain; fig. 3 is a perspective view of an alternative rail arrangement. the conveyor of fig. 1 comprises a plurality of cross bridges, generally denoted 10, which are suitably spaced from each other longitudinally of the conveyor. each cross-bridge 10 comprises an uppermost bridge portion 10a and a lowermost bridge portion 10b which are clamped together by means of a screw 11, which is inserted from below and which, in the instant case, also secures the bridge 10 to a crossrunning bracket 12. the bridges 10 carry ongitudinal lateral guide profiles 13,14 for a diagrammatically shown conveyor chain 15 which is preferably designed as a so called universal joint chain to easily permit bending both in the vertical plane and the horizontal plane. because of the requirements for quiet running and easy cleaning etc. the chain preferably consists essentially of nylon or a similar material. the uppermost bridge portions 10a have, at the lower edges, a side chamfer 16 and 17, respectively, and the lowermost bridge portions lob have upstanding edge flanges 18 and 19, respectively, whereby there, between the side chamfers and the edge flanges, are formed slots wherein longitudinal obliquely inwardly and downwardly directed tongues 20 and 21 of the profiles 13 and 14 protrude in a manner such that the profiles will be clamped to the cross-bridges 10 as the screws 11 are tightened. the inner sides of the lateral guide profiles 13, 14 are provided with grooves to receive guide strips 22 and 23, respectively, of a low friction material, such as a suitable plastic material, for instance. the uppermost bridge portions 10a have at the ends, i.e. comperativelyclose to the guide profiles 13, 14, recesses wherein longitudinal u-profiles 24, 25 are fitted. these profiles carry slide

claims.    1. a conveyor comprising and endless chain (15) which runs on slide ribs (26, 27) and. is laterally guided by means of lateral guide profiles (13, 14), the slide ribs and the lateral guide profiles being carried by cross-bridges (10) which are mutually spaced longitudinally of the conveyor, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that each cross-bridge comprises an uppermost bridge portion (10a)   anda    lowermost bridge portion   (lob)    which may be clamped together in order to receive and clamp between them portions of the respective lateral guide profile.    2. a conveyor according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the uppermost and lowermost bridge portions   (10a,    lob) are designed to rest against each other at the ends thereof in such a manner that the uppermost bridge portion   (10a)    will be slightly bent and within itself clamps one or more slide ribs (26, 27) as the bridge portions (10a, lob) are clamped together by means of a central screw (11).     3. a conveyor according to claim 1 or claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the uppermost bridge portions (10a), at the lower edges, are provided with a lateral chamfer (16, 17) whereas the lowermost bridge portions   (1013)    are provided with upstanding edge flanges (18, 19), whereby there between the lateral chamfers and the edge flanges are formed slots, into which longitudinal, obliquely inwardly and downwardly directed tongues (20, 21) of the lateral guide profiles (13, 14) are insertable, so that the lateral guide profiles (13, 14) are clamped to the cross-bridges as these components are clamped together.
