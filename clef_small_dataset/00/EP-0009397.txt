<ABSTRACT>
submicroscopic particles of anion exchange resin  comprise approximately spherical beads of crosslinked  copolymer having diameters of 0. 01 to 1. 5 micrometers and  bear 0. 7 to 1. 5 anion exchange functional groups per mo­ nomer unit.  the particles may be used in the  removal of ionic impurities from liquids and may subse­ quently be separated from the treated liquids by floccula­ tion.  the particles may be made by emulsion polymeriza­ tion followed by coagulation of the emulsion polymer beads,  separation of the resulting coagulum particles from the  emulsion polymerization medium and functionalization of  the beads, which in some cases will remain as coagulum  particles and in other cases will redisperse during function­ alization.  also of interest are chloromethylated intermedi­ ates for the functionalized resin.
