<ABSTRACT>
a titanium trichloride composition has the formula:   ticl₃(alrxx3-x)nealb   where e is an ether or thioether; l is a defined ester, an  amine or a ketone; and a and b are each greater than 0. 001  and not more than 0. 50.  the composition has a low surface  area, typically less than 50 m²/g.  the composition can be  prepared by reacting titanium tetrachloride with an organo-aluminium  compound, optionally heating the reaction product,  contacting the reaction product at an elevated temperature  with at least one of e and l and washing the product  subsequent to the treatment with e.  in the composition,  e is conveniently di-n-butyl ether or diisoamyl ether  and l can be tetramethylethylenediamine; ethyl benzoate;  benzophenone; glycerol monostearate; glycerol triacetate;  glycerol tripalmitate; glycerol trimethacrylate; pentaerythritol  tetra-acrylate or ethyl phenyl acetate.  the composition  can be used as a component of a catalyst for the polymerisation  of olefine monomers such as propylene.  copolymers  having a useful combination of properties can be obtained.
