<ABSTRACT>
method and instrument (17) for fabricating a dental  restorative (11) having an attaching section and a tooth-­ shaped section projecting therefrom, the latter section being  provided with a predetermined standard occlusal surface  including cusps and fossae, said method comprising:   (a) forming models (12) of opposing portions of a patient's  jaws, one of the jaw portions including a segment for  supporting the restorative (11) in a predetermined  location;   (b) positioning the attaching section and the tooth-shaped  section on the supporting segment of the one-jaw por­ tion model (12);   (c) shaping the attaching section to the contour of the  supporting segment engaged thereby;   (d) contacting a predetermined area of the occlusal sur­ face with a segment of said instrument (17) having a  predetermined rounded exterior (19) and imparting  indicia on portions of said surface area contacted  thereby, said indicia identifying said portions of poten­ tial interference with the desired occlusion to be  effected with said restorative (11) when said models  (12) are in occluding relation; and   (e) removing a selected number of said identified poten­ tial interference portions from the occlusal surface.
