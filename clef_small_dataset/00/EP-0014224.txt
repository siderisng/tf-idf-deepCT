<DESCRIPTION>
gas insulated switch-gear apparatus the present invention relates to a gas insult switch-gear apparatus, and more particularly to an improvement of a gas insulated switch-gear apparatus ;.-cp is suitbe nor use in 2 substation of small fl@@@ space and which is easy to install, mairza-n and inspect. the gas insulated switch-gear apparatus ic uses sf6 gas as insulating medium has an advantage of considerable reduction of insulation distance but may require a large floor space depending on a particular arrangement of the apparatus. recently, it has become difficult fcr t substation in which the gas insulated switch-gear apparatus is mounted to assure a wide ground and hence an arrangement of the apparatus which enables considerable reduction of floor space for mounting has been desired. in order to meet the above requirernent, has been proposed to arrange an apparatus of different one of three phases on each story of a building, arrange a plurality of circuit breakers between two parallel busbars, and arrange disconnecting switches between the circuit breakers and the busbars and external terminals, respectively so that various distribution networks car. be constructed (see u.s. patent 3,302,069 to wilcox, cr it has been proposed to electrically interconnect ele equipments in a substation including transformers, circuit breakers and disconnecting switches through a ring busbar and accommodate the assembly at different vertical spatial levels of a sectioned building (see u.s. patent 3,378,731 to whitehead), or it has also been proposed to provide first and second base planes arranged in parallel to each other at different vertical spatial levels, on which base planes necessary electric facilities such as circuit breakers are mounted, and arrange a gas insulated busbar between those base planes closely to the second base plane which lies above the first base plane (see japanese utility novel publication no. 1131l/71). a ou5;n those proposals can considerably reduce the floor space for mounting by multi-story construction, they still have problems of necessitating r.-co .e arc manpower for the installation, maintenance and inspection of the apparatus because of the complexity of the arranged ment of the electric equipments and the busbars on the respective stories. sumiury of the invention it is an object of the present invention to provide a gas insulated switch-gear apparatus which enables considerable reduction of floor space for mounting and which is very easy to install, maintain and inspect. the above object of the present invention can be achieved by arranging gas insulated busbar devices which electrically interconnect electric equipments inlcudlng gas filled circuit breakers and gas insulated disconnecting switches such that the gas insulated bus bar devices are horizontally spaced from the electric equipments. in a preferred form of the present invention, a gas insulated switch-gear apparatus is provided in which 2 plurality of electric equipments including gas filled circuit breakers and gas insulated disconnecting switches are horfcntalffly arranged on each of first and second base planes which are arranged in parallel to each other at different vertical spatial levels. the gas insulated busbar devices which electrically interconnect
