<ABSTRACT>
heat transfer elements and method for the manufacture  of such elements comprising a composite wall.  the heat  transfer wall (1) comprises a plastics panel (2) with a plu­ rality of studs (4) or rods of high thermal conductivity ma­ terial extending transversely through the panel (2).  the  surfaces of the panel may carry a high thermal conductivity  lining (5) and the rods may project from the panel surfaces.  the method of making such a heat transfer element  comprising forming a base wall member (2) from one ma­ terial, forming bores in the wall member (2) extending  transversely between the outer surfaces thereof, and filling  said bores with another material (4) of higher thermal  conductivity.
