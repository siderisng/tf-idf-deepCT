<ABSTRACT>
For the machining of small workpieces, eg. b. From semiconductor chips, a device for recording / A Blegen and transport of the small workpieces is used. The device consists of a number of nozzles (62), which are moved stepwise between the individual machining stations (69) by a rotatable support (11), which are arranged in a circular path. Recording / dispensing a small workpiece (68) attracted or repelled by the controller of vacuum overpressure to the nozzle opening is carried out by lifting / lowering the nozzle (62) above the surface of a machining station (69). The carrier (11) of the nozzles (62) and a rotary valve (16) are individually driven by synchronously controlled stepper motors (18, 24). The rotational movements of the carrier (11) and the rotary valve (16) for controlling negative pressure / overpressure in the nozzles (62) and in a cylindrical chamber (64) for lifting / abnormal Ken of the nozzles is carried out according to a predetermined program.
