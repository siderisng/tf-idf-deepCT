<ABSTRACT>
The control unit contains a memory in which a program with command words is stored, a conditional multiplexer, which is determined whether there is a condition specified in a command word, and an address unit in which the current address of the command word to be applied in the memory is. To execute interruptions of the currently running program, another multiplexer, another address unit and at least one address register is provided. If an interrupt request occurs, the current address is brought to the address register. The address of the next command word to be processed is supplied via the further multiplexer of the address unit. After completing the processing of the interrupt request, the content of the address register is applied again to the address unit by the further multiplexer. The further multiplexer is controlled by the further address unit.
