<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for layered stacking of general cargo (S) on a loading pallet (6), with a starting roller (13) having an inlet roller (1) and one of these downstream, located out of stationary support rails (2), on which of a conveyor Location of the inlet roller track supplied piece goods are assembled by means of a transfer member layered by way, and with a hook lift (4) moving in a closed web curve (4), which each receives a general framework in the intermediate station, lifts up, moving in front of much vertical scraper (3) and on the charging pallet lowered and then withdrawn by the scrapers, with the rollers of the inlet roller conveyor (1) to be driven to the starting strip (13) for decreasing speed, the starting strip (13) after formation of a piece user parts prior to the activity of the transfer member for spending the pieces of pieces in the Station station (2 ) It is movable from the applied general cargo (S) and the initially empty charging range (6) from a highest position under progressive stacking into a lowest position is lowered. Further features relate to the detailed embodiment of the inlet roller conveyor (1), the starting strip (13) and the fork lecturer (4).
