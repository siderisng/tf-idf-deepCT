<ABSTRACT>
the method involves secluded handling of blood samples.   the device for performing the method comprises a container  adapted to contain a blood sample and a so-called  phase body (4) inserted into the container beforehand, which  after centrifugal treatment of the container separates the  phases of the blood from each other.  the container consists of  a tube length (1) each end of which is closed by one pierceable,  self-sealing closure (2 and 3 resp. ).  the blood sample is  introduced by means of e. g.  a cannula (5) through the one  closure (2) and one of the blood phases formed during centrifugation  is removed through the other closure (3) by means  of e. g.  a cannula.
