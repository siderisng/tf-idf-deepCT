<ABSTRACT>
an electrical switch comprises a body (11), including a  base (12), an operating member (13) supported by the body  for rotational and axial movement relative thereto, an aper­ ture (18) extending through the base (12) and a light source  support member (19) received in said aperture (18).  the sup­ port member (19) and the wall of the aperture (18) are so  shaped that the support member (19), can be located in the  base (12) in either of first and second different axial positions  relative to the base (12).  the support member (19) includes a  blocking element, which in the first axial location of the sup­ port member (19) relative to the base (12), extends into the  path of either axial or rotational movement of the operating  member (13) relative to the body to prevent such movement  of the operating member (13) relative to the body (11);, the  second location of the support member (19) relative to the  base (12) being such that said blocking element lies out of the  path of either axial or rotational movement of the operating  member (13) so that both movements of the operating  member (13) relative to the body are permitted.
