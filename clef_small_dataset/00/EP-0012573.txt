<ABSTRACT>
an electrode for an arc furnace comprising a water-足 cooled tubular column (2) and dependent therefrom a num足 ber of interconnected graphite or carbon sections, the co足 lumn surrounding and being electrically insulated from one or  more bus bars (5,6) extending centrally through the column  and connected to a conductive screw-threaded member (7)  at one end thereof, one of the graphite sections (13) being  secured to the member, and that section, together with the  other(s), being secured to one another through graphite nip足 ples (15) having screw-threads of the same size as that of the  said member.
