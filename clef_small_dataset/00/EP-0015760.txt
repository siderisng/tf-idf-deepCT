<ABSTRACT>
an electric plug assembly comprises a preformed  insulating base (1) through which plug pins (4) protrude,  each pin having a shoulder (6, 7) bearing against the front  face (2) of the base, and a flexible cable (10) whose conduc­ tors (11, 13) are connected to conductor terminals asso­ ciated with the pins.  a preformed insulating spider (20) is  supported on and connected to the base (1) and is so  shaped that it bears against parts (15) of the pins (4) pro­ truding from the front face (2) of the base and/or against the  conductor terminals to hold the pins (4) in position in the  base (1).  an inner moulded insulating body (24) wholly  encapsulates the conductor terminals.  an outer moulded  insulating body (25) wholly or partially encapsulates the  inner moulded body (24) and is bonded to the sheath of the  flexible cable (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
an improved electric plug assembly this invention relates to an electric plug assembly of the kind in which the plug pins and associated conductor terminals are mounted in a preformed body of electrically insulating material, the conductors of a length of flexible insulated multi-conductor cable are electrically connected to appropriate terminals of the plug, and a moulded plug body of electrically insulating material wholly or partially encapsulates the preformed body and the plug pins and associated conductor terminals with an appropriate length of each pin protruding from the plu; assembly and is permanently bonded to the insulating covering of a part of the length of cable. electric plug assemblies of this kind will hereinafter, for convenience, be referred to as "of the kind described". three pin electric plug assemblies of the kind described are especially suitable for use with domestic appliances because such appliances can be sold to the public with the electric plug permanently bonded to the flexible cable of an appliance, thereby eliminating the risk that an unskilled user of an appliance may connect a conventional three pin plug to an end of the flexible cable of the appliance in an incorrect manner which, when the appliance is used, may result in injury to the user and/or permanent damage to the appliance. it has been found that, in manufacturing electric plug assemblies of the kind described, there is a risk that, during moulding of the plug body, a wire or wires of the exposed end of a cable conductor connected to one of the terminals will become detached from the terminal and will protrude through the moulded plug body. a plug assembly which is connected to a domestic electrical appliance and which has a live wire or wires protruding through the plug body is extremely dangerous, especially if handled with damp hands - as may be the case when the plug assembly is connected to a domestic washing machine. it is the object of the present invention to provide an improved electric plug assembly of the kind described in which the aforesaid risk is eliminated or at least substantially reduced. according to the invention, the improved electric plug assembly of the kind described comprises a preformed body of electrically insulating material having holes therethrough in which are fitted plug pins which protrude from the rear face of the preformed body and each of which has'at least one shoulder bearing against the front face of the preformed body to limit the extent of protrusion of the pin; a preformed spider of electrically insulating material. which is supported by a plurality of limbs on, and is connected to, the front face of the preformed body and which has protrusions bearing against parts of the plug pins protruding from the front face of the preformed body and/or against the conductor terminals or fuse contact associated with the pins to hold the pins in position in the holes with the shoulders bearing against the front face of the preformed body; an inner
