<ABSTRACT>
a radio frequency generator comprises a set of switch­ ing transistors (1 to 4) which drive a radio frequency filter  (5,6) of which an inductor (6) is tightly coupled to a coil (15)  which feeds a bridge rectifier (17).  the rectifier (17) is biassed  by the source of direct current and begins its rectifying action  when the load current becomes excessive.  the load current  becomes excessive as a result for instance of mismatch of  the antenna (7,8,9).  the arrangement provides protection  against high load currents and thereby protects the switch­ ing elements (1 to 4) from damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
"radio frequency generators" this invention relates to a radio frequency generator which incorporates a switching inverter which drives a filler to provide an output at a radio frequency for feeding a transmitting antenna. the inverter may assume any one of a variety of forms, but usually provides a square wave signal with the aid of solid state s itches which control power switches either directly or via a coupling transformer. the combination of an inverter and a radio frequency filter, such as a series resonance circuit, can provide a very efficient source of radio frequency power. however, accidents such as mismatch at the load or flash over at the antenna'¯ insulor car easily destroy the solid state switches and a though various protective circuits and devices have beer, devised, their failure rate has been so hiqh as to discourage the use of switching inverters for radio frequency generators. onc object of teie present invention is to provide a generator with an improved protection against the effects of high load current cue to mismatch. according to the invention, a radio frequency generator conlprises a switchinu inverter which drives a radio-frequency filter and includes a series reactance and a rectifier which is coupled to that reactance and is biassed such that its rectifying action limits the inveerter's switching current and ; retects the switching elements of the inverter. it is preferable that the rectifier1 which may be constituted by a bridge rectifier tightly coupled to an inductor of a series resonance circuit constituting the aforementioned filter, be biassed to provide substantial rectification only when the radio frequency current through the series reactance exceeds the radio frequency current in normal conditions of loading. the rectifier may be biassed by the source of direct current that feeds the switching inverter and to return rectified current td that source. the rectifier will limit the radio frequency voltage across the series reactance and thereby limit the current through; it; this action liiiits the current through the stitches of the inverter and thereby protects them. one embodiment of the invention and a modification thereof will now be described by way of example with réference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is an explanatory diagram of a radio frequency generator comprising a switching inverter and a radio frequency filter; figure 2 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of tie invention, some ancillary circuits having been omitted for simplicity; and figure 3 illustrates a modification of part of the embodiment illustrated by figure 2. figure 1 illustrates an inverter which converts direct current from. a source, such as a battery to a filtered radio frequency signal flowing in a load resistance r. the pairs of switches (x,x) and (y,y) are alternately switched for equal periods, the switching cling at the desired radio frequency. a square wave voltage appears at the terminals a and b. the impedance of the series resonant circuit constituted by the inductor i, and the capacitor c is nearly zero at the desired
