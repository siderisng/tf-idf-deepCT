<ABSTRACT>
a system for collecting solar energy comprises a thin  faceplate (1) made up of a large number of optical fibres (2)  whose diameters are in the range of from 0. 5 micron to 2. 0  micron and which are combined together coherently in a  bundle perpendicular to the general plane of the faceplate (1)  and a means (3,4) for focusing the rays issuing from the  optical fibres.  solar rays entering the optical fibres from any  directions within the numerical aperture of the fibres pass  through the fibres, the rays issuing from the exit apertures of  the fibres being parallel to the principal axis of the faceplate  thereby to collect solar energy with a high degree of effi­ ciency.

<DESCRIPTION>
a system for collecting solar energy this invention relates to a system oor collecting solar energy. several different systems for collectn solar energy, or the radiant energy of sunlight, have been previously proposed. as an example, in a solar-electric power plant or a solar furnace, to produce a high temperature sunlight is concentrated on to a receiver by a large number of mirrors which are arranged to follow the sun and which accordingly are often called heliostats; each mirror must be individually moved by clockwork for strictly reflecting the solar rays into a fixed direction and thus to the receiver, so that inevitably the system is very complicated and is of a large scale. in another form of such a system, a unit collector such as a giant parabolic mirror or a fresnel lens nust be also designed to follow the sun, othen:ise the incident solar rays cannot be focused at substanaially one point, and the level of efficiency in collecting solar energy is markedly reduced. many attempts have been made to improve these follower means; but they are still complicated and expensive. the invention therefore seek to provide a system for. collecting solar energy or the radiant energy of sunlight, at a high level of efficiency and therefore lower cost. the present invention thus provides a system for collecting radiant energy of sunlight, including a faceplate for receiving parallel rays cf sunlight, which comprises a thin plate made up of a large number of optical fibres which are each of a diameter ranging from 0.5 micron to 2.0 micron and which are combined coherently in a bundle perpendicular to the plane of the faceplate, and a means for focusing the parallel rays issuing from the optical fibres of the faceplate thereby to concentrate the radiant energy outside the system. thus, in the system of the invention, there is no need for a follower means operable to align the faceplate with the direction of the sun, the system may be very thin, in the form of a parabolic mirror, and the solar energy can be collected underneath the collecting system. the absence of a follower mechanism means that the system can be less expensive and inherently more reliable than the previously proposed systems with follower mechanisms. the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate embodiments and in which: figure 1 shows directivity patterns based on fraunhofer diffraction, occurring when beams of parallel light leave the aperture of an optical fibre along the principal axis of the fire; ; figure 2 is a vertical sectional view of a system of this invention, which has a focusing means comprising two parabolic mirrors, figure 3 is a vertical sectional view of another system of this invention, which has a focusing means in the form of a fresnel lens, figure 4 is a vertical sectional view of a system of this invention, which has a focusing means comprising two parabolic mirrors and a means
