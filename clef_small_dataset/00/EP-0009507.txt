<ABSTRACT>
a removable tissue-born partial denture provided with a  harmless/aesthetic/secure and normalised retention- and  rest-system constructed according a normalised precise  by an aesthetic harmless rest-structure in form of surveyed  surveying-procedure and provided with a harmless (non-­ interferring) bite-function realised with a special devised  denture-mounting device imitating the jaw-function, said  provisions to permit the possibility of the construction of title  according various designs in order to restore the complete  situation of the partly missing teeth in the natural dentition,  said restoration of title is processed in a fracture-resistant  structure according a productive, precise-surveyed  construction-plan.  in order to prevent the conventional straining and harm­ full method of clasping and supporting the living abutment-­ teeth (causing root-trauma and eruption of teeth) with the  object to retain and support the restoration in the technical  field of the removable partial denture-construction made of  resin or chrome-alloy instead the said restoration of title is  devised to be retained securely/harmless and inconspicuous  by means of minute preformed resilient retention-anchors  [(10x) designed for anterior-abutment teeth, (10) for  posterior-abutment teeth] fastened in the surveyed path of  insertion (14x-14) of the saddle-part (3) of restoration, said  anchors indestructible made of high tensile pre-wrought  chrome-nickel wire 0. 50 mm.  - 0. 60 mm.  ⊘ effecting a resi­ lient stressless directed hold-contact between the remaining  living teeth 7 and 7x, meanwhile the restoration is supported  by an aesthetic harmless rest-structure in form of surveyed  onlays 5+6 processed in fracture and wear-resistant clear or  tooth-toned resin; said "anchor" retention- and "onlay"  rest-structure are covered with a thick-graded medical  silicon-oil liniment to protect enamel against the acid-­ formation and bacterien, the wear of the resin and the  anchor-friction.  in case of weak abutment-teeth (7,7x) in the upper partial  restorations of title, an alternative of rest-structure in form of  a parabolic rim (4+4x), depth 1mm. , width 3mm.  is proces­ sed uniformly in the inner-surface of the base (2) made of  resin or chrome; the said base is designed in various forms  to achieve a harmless construction in respect with the  remaining living-abutment-teeth and is processed in  fracture-resistant gumtoned resin which outer- and innersur­ face is protected with a medical graded silicon-oil to resist  food-stains and plaque, bacterien, tartre-stone, nicotine and  discolouring-agents, said base (2) may be made in chrome,  except the saddles (3).  the bilateral free-end partial construc­ tion (case where all posterior-teeth are missing) is provided  with an extra labial bar fixed (18), hinged (22) or partable  (22x) for retention and stability in the front.

<DESCRIPTION>
complete specification complete specification for the invention entitled: " a harmless cosmetic removable partial denture construction" the following statement is a full description of this in -vention, including the best method of performing it known to we filed on page two: this invention relates to the removable tissue-born simplified and practical partial denture and proper method of make to be retained removably in the various situations of missing teeth(in case of partly missing teeth between the living and remaining teeth aswell in case of the complete missing of the posterior-teeth in dental term "a bilateral free-end partial")in the complete arch of the hu -man natural healthy dentition,there being means carried by said restoration in title for a secure-permanent and harmless support and retention on the remaining living abutment-teeth and tissue aswell means to enhance the aesthetic and maximum hygiene and com- -fort by mode of a self-cleaning protection achieved by a silicon medical graded oil-film and liniment the conventional clasp-and rest-structure designed for retention and support in removable chrome or plastic partial dentures are devised according a straining-rigi embracing of living teeth, .said manner causing serious defects effected by the masticatory pulling-forces to the parodontium tearing the rootperiost(membra -ne) and cracking the enamel of the living abutment-teeth prepa -ring for decay and eruption. ) it is the main-object of this invention to provide and secure a retentive and supporting capacity for the said restoration of ti -tie in a harmless,cosmetic,hygienic,formstable,fracture-resistant i pecise, permanent-retentive and adjustable manner. an other object of the present invention is the provision of a self-cleaning protection by means oj a medical graded protective silicon oilfilm daily applied by a dispenser on the outersuriace of denture and a silicon-oil liniment applied in the innersurfa cf dcntu'e( iatent-applied /australia/no 1943,5/10/77) thereby enhancing the resistance to foodimpact and plaque aswell the re -sistance to discolouring-agents on the whole restoration teeth included caused by foodatains,nicotine,bartrestone,curry etc.., aswell the resistance to the bacterien and acidformation on the enamel of living teeth. an other object of the present invention is the provision of a ntralnfree bitefunction(articulation) in the regitoration of title free from vertical and horizontal levereffects according the last modern articulation theories based on a horizontal-rotational gli- -ding or based on a non-interferring gliding of the existing natu -ral abraded unobtrusive tooth-pattern. said restoration is surveyed and processed(heatcuring) in fracture -resistant resin according a proper direct tecnic on te mastersto- -nemodel without the duplicating procedure. according the present invention of the title there is provided a special tissue-born base provided with rest-onlays or palatinal baseotop(instead of metal-reets) made of fracture-resistant resin said base is combined with anterior or posterior saddles carrying the detlture-teeth,eaid reutorntion of title may be in form of n single! saddle with 2 or 3 or 4 denture-teeth,said blue and sad- -dies are deigned to achieve a harmless supporting restoration in respect with the remaining living and abutmentteeth,1ngiva- -margin and parodontium. conveniently in one form of the invention,single saddle or various saddles united in a base between the
