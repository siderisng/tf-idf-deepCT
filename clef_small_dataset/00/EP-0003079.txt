<ABSTRACT>
in (sb0. 1as0. 9) light emissive diodes and lasers are grown  on ga sb substrates to give lattice matching.  ga sb has  higher band-gap, high refractive index therefore gives  electrical, but not optical, confinement required for laser  action.  both confinement types provided by sandwiching  active layer between layers of (al0. 6ga0. 4)sb.  in (sb0. 1as0. 9)  emits at approximately 4Âµm, but emission can be shifted by  increasing the proportion of in sb and restoring the lattice  match by the addition of another compound semiconductor  e. g.  ga as for longer wavelength emission of in p or al as for  shorter wavelength emission.

<DESCRIPTION>
i a red light emissrve devices this invention relates to infra-red light emissive devices, and in particular to such devices having active light emissive regions of the ternary solid solution in(sb, as) and related multicomponent (quarternary or higher) solid solutions. light emissive devices have been made that had an active light emissive region of in(sb, as) grown epitaxially upon an in as substrate. a problem with this type of construction is that the addition of in sb to in as to form a solid solution has the effect of changing the lattice spacing. therefore a graded interlayer was necessary between the active region and the substrate, but even this did not entirely remove the strain from the active region which was relatively heavily dislocated. the present invention is directed to the problem of lattice mismatch. according to the present invention there is provided an infra-red light emissive device having an active light emissive region of material of the ternary in(sb, as) solid solution having a lattice spacing matched with that of ga sb, which material is epitaxially grown directly or indirectly upon a substrate of ga sb. the the invention also provides an infra-red light emissive device having an active light emissive region of material of a multicomponent, quarternary or higher, solid solution having a lattice spacing matched with that of ga sb. and based upon the ternary =n(sb, as) solid solution, which material is epitaxially grown directly or indirectly upon a substrate of ga sb. ga sb has the same lattice constant as a particular compound of in(sb, as), approximately in(sb, 1as0.9 therefore in(sbo laso 9) grown on a ga sb substrate is substantially strain free. there follows a description of infra-red light emissive devices embodying the invention in preferred forms. the description refers to the accompanying drawings in which: figure 1 is a graph depicting the variation.of lattice spacing and band-gap with composition for a number of ternary solid solutions of compound semiconductors, figure 2 depicts a schematic cross-section through a light emissive diode embodying the invention, figure 3 is a graph depicting the variation in dielectric constant of the (al, ga)sb solid solution with composition, and figures 4 and 5 depict schematic cross-sections through two further constructions of device embodying the present invention. referring to figure 1, and in particular to the in(sb, as) line between in as and in sb, it can be seen that the addition of progressively more in sb to in as has the effect of progressively increasing the lattice spacing at a relatively rapid rate. (the four hatchings on this line, and each of the others, mark the 20, 40, 60 and 80% points respectively.) the rate of increase in lattice spacing is for instance much more rapid than that produced by adding al as to ga as to form (al, ga)as. this shows why the growth of in(sb, as) upon an in as substrate is much more difficult than growing (al, ga)as upon a substrate of ga as. however, also from
