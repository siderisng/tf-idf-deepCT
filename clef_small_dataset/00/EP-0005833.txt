<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a circuit arrangement for the preparation of conference connections in a PCM time division multiplexing system. For the production of conference connections, in a conference rate, the proportions of the individual conference participants must be summed up to a sum code word, during the timings of the individual conference participants, after deduction of the proportion of the relevant conference participant, which has occurred in the previous pulse frame, a residual code word is sent to this subscriber. The invention is intended to specify a technologically easy-to-be realized conference set, which works securely even if participants are involved in the conference, which are assigned to adjacent timings. According to the invention, this is achieved in that a conferencing memory consisting of two storage halves (SK1, SK2) is present, these memory halves alternatively use the conference shares and timely multiple delivery of the sum code word to a subtractor (SUB) which is provided by a delay member (SV) by a pulse frame delayed conference shares of another conference participant subtracted. The invention is particularly suitable for use in extension systems of PCM time division multiplexing systems.
