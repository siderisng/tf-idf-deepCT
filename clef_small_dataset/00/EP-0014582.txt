<ABSTRACT>
a frame for holding a member of laminar form comprises  a series of edge members (3) each of which has at least one  internal, longitudinally extending cavity (7a, 7b) bounded by  an external wall of the edge member.  the external wall is  resilient and has a longitudinal slit (8a, 8b) which can be  opened to admit the edge of the laminar form member by  depressing the wall.  upon release, the wall returns to its  original position and grips the laminar form member.  to  assist in the retention of the laminar form member in the slit,  the edge of the member may be thickened.  the edge  members are locked together by corner pieces that  telescopically engage in the cavities in adjacent edge  members.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to means for supporting laminar sheets and more particularly to double glazing. according to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided means for supporting an element in laminar form including a frame composed of substantially uniform cross-section members each of which has at least one longitudinal cavity, a wall of which has a slit to accept and retain the laminar element. according to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a double glazing unit including a sheet of transparent material held in a frame including strips of substantially uniform cross-section members each of which has at least one longitudinal cavity, a wall of which has a slit to accept and retain the material. the transparent material may be a sheet of clear plastics film for example 125 micron thick ultra-violet stabilised polyester film. the material may carry a strip of adhesive tape folded around its edges to form a thickened portion to prevent the material being inadvertently pulled out of the slit. the frame may also include corner pieces with projections arranged to engage the end of the longitudinal cavity of adjacent strips. the frame may be rectangular. the corner pieces may have means to grip the ends of the strips and may be provided with a slot to accom-nodate the corner of the sheet of material. preferably, each member is of a plastics material. the wall having the slit has a degree of resiliency enabling the slit to be opened to receive the laminar sheet. the slit then closes over the edge portion of the sheet and retains it in position. embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, making reference to the accompanying drawings in which: figure 1 shows an elevation of part of a rectangular double glazing unit, figure 2 shows a cross-section along the line a-a in figure 1, figures 3a, b, c show details of a component, figures 3d1 e show alternative forms of the component of figure 3a, figures 3f and 3g show details of another component, figure 4 is a cross-sectional view of another component, figure 5 is a cross-sectional view of a sliding sash double glazing unit, and figures 6 and 7 are perspective views of another component. referring to figures 1 and 2 a rectangular double glazing unit of the type suitable for adding to an existing single glazed window consists of a sheet of clear plastics material 1 supported under a slight tension in a frame 2. the frame 2 consists of four edging strips 3 of which only two are shown in figure 1. each edging strip 3 is a length of extruded plastics material of identical cross-section to that of the other three edging strips. hence edging strips to build a glazing frame can be manufactured using only one extrusion die. in addition to the edging strips 3 the frame 2 has four corner pieces, such as that denoted by the reference numeral 4

<CLAIMS>
claims:    1. a frame for supporting an element of laminar form, the frame comprising a number of edge members each of which has at least one longitudinally extending cavity, the cavity having a bounding wall that is an external wall of the member, the wall being resilient and having a longitudinal slit for accepting and retaining the member of laminar form.    2. a frame as claimed in claim 1 in which adjacent edge members are fastened together by means of corner pieces.    3. a frame as claimed in claim 2 in which each corner piece has an extension or extensions that engage telescopically the cavity in each adjacent edge member.    4. a frame as claimed in claim 3 in which each corner piece has a first component that engages one of the adjacent edge members an a second   component    that mates with the first component and engages the other one of the adjacent edge members.    5. a frame as claimed in claim 4 in which locking means are provided for locking together the first and second components.      6o    a frame as claimed in claim 3 and further comprising dowel members that engage in the cavity of an edge member and the corner piece.       7.    a frame as claimed in any one of the preceding claims and comprising a member of laminar form held in the supporting frame and in which the edges of the laminar  form member are of increased thickness as compared with the thickness of the remainder of the member of laminar form.    8. a frame as claimed in claim 7 in which the increased thickness results from the application to the edges of a strip of material.    9. a frame as claimed in claim 7 in which the increased thickness results from crimping or folding the edges of the member of laminar form.    10. a frame as claimed in any one of claims 1-6 in which the wall edges bounding the slit are adapted to form surfaces that grip the edges of the member of laminar form to hold the latter in place.
