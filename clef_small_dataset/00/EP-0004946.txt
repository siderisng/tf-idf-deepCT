<ABSTRACT>
a drill hammer, in particular deep hole hammer (10), is provided with a terminal (16) for a compressed air source and a three-part control housing (30, 32, 34), which is a valve and deflection system (38, 40; 44, 46, 50, 52) and sits in a jacket body (22) attached to an outer tube (12).A central sliding tube (60) is positively connected to the control housing and performs a main piston (70) and an intermediate piston (80), which is movable back and forth on a drill bit (94).At the lower end of the sliding tube (60), a check valve (59, 61) may be arranged.In the sliding tube (60), an insert (62) is mounted, which forms a number of channels (67, 68) by partition walls (64) which lead in radial openings (69, 71, 73, 74) which are from the sliding tube (60) Manufacture from different flow connections.
