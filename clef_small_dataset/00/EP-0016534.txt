<ABSTRACT>
a walkway consists of a plurality of walkway elements (4).   each element is a plastics moulding having an upper surface  provided with non-slip material and can be linked to its neigh­ bour by a suitable method e. g.  interlocks or clips.  for gutter use location points are provided on the under­ side of each walkway element for a support member, e. g.  legs  (5), which can be so shaped as to allow water flow in a gutter  with minimum obstruction.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in or relating to walkways this invention is concerned with walkways, and in particular with a walkway composed of elements moulded from plastics material in the building of factories the roof is commonly constructed in a form which consists of a series of ridges separated by valleys, a gutter being provided along the bottom of each valley. the roof cladding is frequently asbestos cement sheet with glass roof lights. for maintenance purposes it is necessary for access to be gained to areas of the roof from time to time, and on such occasions the gutters form a convenient walkway across the roof, ladders being fixed to give access to the sloping areas of the roof. the gutters themselves are often constructed from asbestos-cement and are liable to damage if walked upon. also they tend to be narrow so that a person walking in them is liable to catch his or her ankles on the edges of the roof cladding sheets. it is therefore desirable to provide walkways across the roof to enable workmen to cross the roof without walking in the gutters, and the usual solution to this problem has been to construct wooden walkways on supports which rest in the gutters. these walkways are in extensive use but have several snags. they tend to obstruct the gutters so that in storm conditions the gutters may overflow. they also rot eventually, with the result that debris falls into the gutters adding to the obstruction problem. also, sound timber is costly and heavy so that maintenance of the walkways is an expensive and timeconsuming job, and the surface of the wood is apt to become slippery and dangerous. the present invention aims to provide an alternative for such wooden walkways which is safe and rotproof. it is also a problem that flat felted roofs or gutters consisting of wide troughs lined with roof#ing felt are liable to damage if walked upon, because of the nature of the felt and it is therefore desirable to provide a protective walkway on such a-surface. according to the present invention there is provided a roof walkway which comprises a plurality o#f linked elongate elements, each said element including a tread portion comprising a single substantially rigid plastics moulding of a form providing drainage holes therein and a tread surface comprising a high friction material preferably each element is individually capable of being supported on one or more support members in an elevated position relative to the roof, for which purpose said tread portion has moulded into it location means for said support member. according to the present invention also a roof walkway element includes a tread portion comprising a single substantially rigid plastics moulding of a form providing drainage holes therein, and a tread surface comprising a high friction material, and includes also location means in said read portion for at least one support member to support said tread portion out of a gutter. the plastics moulding may, for example, be of a -structural

claims   1. a roof walkway which comprises a plurality of  linked elongate elements, each said element  including a tread portion comprising a single  substantially rigid plastics moulding of a form  providing drainage holes- therein and a tread  surface comprising a high friction material.   2. a roof walkway according to claim   lin    which each  element is individually cap#able of being supported  on one or more support members in an elevated  position relative to the roof the tread portion  having moulded into it location means for said  support members.   3. a roof walkway according to claim 1 or 2 in which  each element is such that when   placedon    a#-flat roof  without a support member drainage of water along  the roof is possible both laterally and  longitudinally through the element 4. a roof walkway according to claim 1, 2 or 3 in  which the elements are linked together by means of  clips engaging in recesses or apertures in said  plastics mouldings.   5. a roof walkway element including a tread portion  comprising a single substantially rigid plastics  moulding of a form providing drainage holes therein  and a tread surface comprising a high friction  material, and including location means in said  tread portion for at least one support member to  support said tread portion out of a gutter.     6. a walkway element according to claim 5 in which  said location means comprises a plurality of  sockets in the underside of said tread portion to  provide alternative locations for one or more  support members.   7. a walkway element according to claim 5 or 6 which  includes at least one support member beneath the  tread portion for supporting said tread portion out  of a gutter, said support member being slender in  cross section at right angles to the intended  direction of the walkway such as to allow adequate  flow capacity in a gutter when in use.   8. a walkway element according to claim 5, 6 or 7  which includes two or more support legs having stem  and foot portions and engaging sockets in the  underside of   said -tread    portion.   9. a walkway element as claimed in any one of claims 5  to 8 in which the tread portion comprises a single  substantially rigid plastics moulding, having on  its underside both lateral and longitudinal  strengthening ribs and a plurality of locating  sockets for support members, and having drainage  holes between said ribs.   10. a walkway element as claimed in claim 9 in which  said plastics moulding has a length which bears a  simple ratio to its width.    11. a walkway element according to claim 9 or 10 in  which the plastics moulding has at its corners  apertures to receive clips to link the elements  together.     12. a walkway element according to   claim9,    10 or   11    in  which the plastics moulding has apertures at its  sides to receive fixing brackets to facilitate its  being fastened to a flat roof.   13. a walkway element as claimed in any   oneof    claims 9  to 12 in which castellations are provided in at  leat some of the strengthening ribs to allow  drainage across them along a -flat roof.   14. a walkway element substantially as described herein  with reference to the accompanying drawings.   15. a roof walkway substantially as described herein  with reference to the accompanying drawings.
