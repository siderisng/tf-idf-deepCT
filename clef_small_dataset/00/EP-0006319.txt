<ABSTRACT>
a burner system for gaseous or liquid fuels adapted for  insertion through a circular tile opening (27) in a furnace  wall (26, 28), comprising a burner tube (16) for alternate  supply of gaseous or liquid fuel.  the burner tube is coaxial  with, and inserted into the circular opening.  a first station­ ary annular vane assembly (39) comprises a plurality of  symmetrically-placed tangentially-directed vanes (42) en­ closing a cylindrical open chamber (35) coaxial with and  upstream of the burner means.  a second movable assembly  (47) of radial vanes (56) is adapted to slide axially about  the burner tube and to be moved from a first position where  it is entirely outside of the chamber space, inwardly to a  second position, where it is entirely inserted into the cham­ ber space and inside of the first annular vane assembly  (39).  menas are provided for flowing combustion air at  selected pressure through the tangential vanes (42) and  into the chamber space.  when the second vane assembly  (47) is moved to its first position, the tangential vanes (42)  provide a swirling helical flow of air into and axially along  the chamber space and into the downstream of the burners  (36), providing a swirling flame.  when the movable vane  assembly (47) is in its second position, inside of the cham­ ber volume, then the tangentially-directed air flowing  through the first vane assembly (39) flows into the second  vane assembly (47) with its radial vanes (56).  this com­ pletely cuts off the helical flow, and causes only axial flow  of air past the burners (36) and into the flame zone (11).
