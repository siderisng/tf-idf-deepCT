<ABSTRACT>
a delayed coking process in which a liquid hydrocar­ bonaceous feedstock is heated in a coker furnace (13) and  then fed to a delayed coking drum (15), and in which overhead  vapors from said coking drum are passed to a coker frac­ tionator (11) where they are separated into light hydrocarbon  products and recycle gas oil, and in which said recycle gas oil  is combined with said feedstock and returned to said coking  drum (15), is characterised in that said recycle gas oil is hyd­ rotreated (20) after being separated from said light hydrocar­ bon products and prior to being combined with said feeds­ tock, whereby the resulting delayed coke is a premium coke,  having a particularly low coefficient of thermal expression.  the premium coke product may be graphitised and  formed into shaped articles.
