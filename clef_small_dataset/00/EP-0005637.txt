<ABSTRACT>
a bilirubin-specific enzyme composition comprises a  fungal enzyme having a protein content which, in the  presence of a bilirubin-containing aqueous liquid having a  ph of about 7. 4 and a temperature of about 37°c, degrades at  least about 0. 02 micromole of bilirubin per minute per  milligram of protein.  the enzyme may be extracted from  mushrooms, and may have the ability to generate hydrogen  peroxide.  the enzyme composition may be employed in wet and  dry analytical methods and dry analytical elements either in  assays for bilirubin or to suppress bilirubin interference in  assays for other materials.
