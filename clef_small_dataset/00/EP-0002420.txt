<ABSTRACT>
semiconductor device is activated by light and, more especially, comprises a field effect transistor (fet), the gate insulator of which comprises impurities sensitive to light.  this field effect transistor (1) comprises a semiconductor substrate (2) equipped with two source and drain regions (3) and (4), and with their contacts (7) and (8), and a dielectric gate layer (6), covered by a conductive gate electrode (9), which is semitransparent to the light employed.  a trap layer (10) is formed by implantation of arsenic or phosphorus ions in this dielectric layer.  depending upon the nature of the polarising voltage applied to the electrode (9), in the presence of light the ions become charged or discharged, characterising the absence or presence of a data item in the device.  accordingly, this device may be used as an element in a light-activated memory.  <image>
