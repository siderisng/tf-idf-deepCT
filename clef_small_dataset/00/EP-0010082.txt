<ABSTRACT>
In a device for closing the Stauschlo ches (4) of a metallurgical vessel (1) for trenary tion of metal (2) and slag (3), a ring gap (13) can be released into the stitch lock (4), compared to the stitched flow wall (13) and a compressed gas line (8) containing closure body (7) provided, which has a tapered to the mouth of the compressed gas line outer sheath. In order to be able to contact this device in large converters and to improve in particular the slag retention effect of this device, the outer shell of the adhesive body (7) of a sphere of dome-shaped surface (23), which passes into a cone-facing surface (24) mouth side , formed, wherein the height (25) of the truncated cone is at least 1-fold and at most 2.5 times the diameter (26) of the mouth-side outlet opening of the compressed gas line (8) and the opening angle (27) of the truncated cone at least 15 and at most 70 ° is.
