<ABSTRACT>
a continuous in-line method for forming an airlaid fibrous  fluff web adjacent the uppermost and lowermost surfaces  of a substantially planar internal reinforcing ply having  substantially the same width as said fibrous web, said ply  being substantially impervious to the passage of fibers from  one surface thereof to the other, in a continuous fiber deposition  zone is disclosed.  in a preferred embodiment, a unique  tissue folding board is employed to permit continuous formation  of an airfelt web having a wet strength tissue reinforcing  member located approximately mid-way between its  uppermost and lowermost surfaces.  in the apparatus for  forming the web, two adjacent vacuum chambers (26,27) are  preferably employed in the continuous forming zone to  compensate for the increased airflow restriction encountered  when forming the uppermost fibrous web position over the  reinforcing ply and the lowermost fibrous web portion.  in a  particularly preferred embodiment, the portion of the internal  ply (20) relative to the uppermost and lowermost surfaces  of the resultant pad may be adjusted by advancing or  retarding the position of the folding board (1) within the fiber  deposition zone (12).
