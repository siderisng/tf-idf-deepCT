<ABSTRACT>
a dry-developing dry film resist is provided comprising a  photopolymerizable layer preferably sandwiched between a  support sheet and a cover sheet, the layer comprising  polymerizable monomer in excess of the absorptive capacity  of the layer, photopolymerization initiator, and binder com­ ponent of a plurality of polymers, at least one of these polym­ ers being incompatible so as to be present as a dispersion in  the layer to reduce the cohesive strength of the layer.  the  layer is developed by peeling away the support sheet, the  unexposed area of the layer adhering to the support sheet and  the exposed area adhering to the substrate to which it was  laminated to form a resist image against such treatments as  etching, plating and soldering, especially to make a printed  circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
title dry-developing photosensitive dry film resist technical field this invention relates to a photosensitive resist material which is capable of dry development to form a resist image on a surface. background art the use of a photopolymerizable dry film as a resist for etching and plating a substrate to form a printed circuit is disclosed in u.s. patent 3,469,g82. although this use has gained widespread- acceptance, it has#the disadvantage of requiring "wet" development of the resist image, i.e., the area of photopolymerlzable layer that is unexposed in the imagewise photoexposure step, is removed by washing away with solvent which does not dissolve the exposed area of the layer. numerous attempts have been made to make a photopolymerizable layer that is tevelopable dry, i.e., the unexposed area of the layer is removed from the exposed area of the layer merely by peeling away of the support sheet, wherein the exposed area of the layer remains on the substrate to which it was laminated and the unexposed area of the layer remains adhered to the support sheet. none of these attempts have been commercially successful. no dry-developing photopolymerizable dry film resist is commercially available. to detail some of these attempts, u.s. patent 3,770,438 discloses a dry-developing photopolymerizable layer on a polymer film support operating according to the principle of the polymerizable monomer being present in the layer in a quantity in excess of the absorptive capacity of the binder so that a thin layer of substantially free monomer is present on the surface of the photopolymerizable layer. this free monomer is detectible on the surface of. a substrate such as copper as an oily residue when the layer is peeled off of the copper prior to any photoexposure of the layer. the free monomer polymerizes when photoexposed to actinic radiation, to adhere the exposed area of the layer to the copper more strongly. than to the film support. the greater affinity of the monomer for the film support than the copper in the unexposed area of the layer enables the unexposed area of the layer to remain adhered tp the film support. different ways for achieving an excess of monomer are used in the patent, e.g., using a hydrocarbon polymer binder and a very large proportion of monomer (77.5% in ex. 3), using a ahloreearbon polymer binder having a lesser absorptive ##ao## to# tot the monomer, thereby reducing the monomer content to 40-50% tlkb 9, 13, 15 & #6), or using a oe#am%t# at à à enleroearbon tolye*t (mi wt. about 20,000) higher @@@@@@ (about out q00) poly(methylmethacrylate) to decrease the flow of the layer. the amount of chlorocarbon polymer used ranged from 24.6 to 41.4 by wt., the amount of hydrocarbon polymer ranged from 3 to 29.4% by wt. and the amount of monomer ranged from 24.2 to 65.6% by wt. (ex. 1, 2, 5-8, 12, 14, and 16). the disadvantage of the drydeveloping photopolymerizable layer of this patent was that either the flow of the layer at ordinary room temperature
