<ABSTRACT>
in conventional kjeldahl analysis for determining the  nitrogen content of a sample, it is common practice to  digest the sample in the presence of a catalyst in order to  speed the analysis.  the most widely used catalyst is mercuric  oxide.  while the use of this catalyst gives acceptable  results, it is now evident that the environmental and health  hazards connected with mercury compounds makes it  desirable to avoid the use of large quantities of such compounds.  it has now been found that an antimonate, preferably  potassium antimonate, may be used as the catalyst to give  acceptable results while avoiding the above-mentioned  problems.  accordingly, the present invention provides, inter alia,  a process for the determination of the nitrogen content of  a sample according to the kjeldahl principle using a catalyst,  characterised in that the catalyst is an antimonate.  the present invention also relates to such a catalyst  and to the use thereof in such a process.
