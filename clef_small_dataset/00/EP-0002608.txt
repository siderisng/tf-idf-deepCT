<ABSTRACT>
a transducer 1 is disclosed which contains a field  creating means 3 and a sensing means 5 responsive to  changes in that field on the proximity of an article 7 thereto.   by observing any change in the sensing means 5 information  concerning the passing of the article 7 can be ascertained.   preferably the transducer 1 has additional field creating  means 9 associated therewith whereby to cause disturbance  to the field created by the field creating means 3 whereby to  cause the sensing means 5 to operate and additionally  provides a field checking facility for the field creating means  3 by either simulating the disturbance of the field which  would be caused by the proximity of the article 7 or by  changing the field while the article 7 is present.  thus the  transducer 1 is checked as to operation of the sensing means  5 and as to presence of the field from the field creating  means 3.  a transducer element 50 comprising two such  transducers 51 and 52 spaced apart is also disclosed.  such a  transducer 50 enables detection of velocity and direction of  movement of the article past the transducer 50.  a method of  detecting information as to the passing of an article is also  disclosed.
