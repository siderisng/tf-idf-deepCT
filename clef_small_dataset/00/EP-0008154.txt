<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides novel ureylene phenyl­ ene anionic naphthalenesulfonic acids, which have com­ plement-inhibiting properties and which may be represent­ ed by the general formula:    wherein x and y are each selected from the group consist­ ing of -co- and -so₂-; r and r₃ are each selected from  the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and -so₃a,  wherein a is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt cation; r₁  and r₄ are each selected from the group consisting of  hydrogen and -coob, wherein b is selected from the group  consisting of hydrogen and a pharmaceutically acceptable  salt cation; r₁ and r₅ are each selected from the group  consisting of hydrogen and methyl; with the proviso that  r, r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄ and r₅ may not all be hydrogen; with the  second proviso that when x and y are both -co- and r₂  is methyl, then r, r₁, r₃, r₄ and r₅ may not all be hydrogen;  and with the third proviso that no phenyl moiety can con­ tain both -so₃a and -coob.  the corresponding amine compounds of the formula  below are novel intermediates for the novelureylene com­ pounds above:
