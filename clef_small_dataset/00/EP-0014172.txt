The lower member has a symmetrical, intensity to three sides of steel sheet-limited cross-section in the form of an upright fungus or a trape of the zes, the pages of which are inclined for a maximum of 30 ° for vertical; The supports protrude into the hollow profile. The upper element (8) is open at the bottom and molded to the lowering of the lower. Internal vertical stiffeners (4) protrude into the lower element. Road-side punches (7) range from foaming (2).
