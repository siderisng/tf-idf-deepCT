<ABSTRACT>
1.  a chill mould for the continuous casting of billets, comprising a casting shaft (2) of a non-magnetic material, an annular tank (3) which surrounds the casting shaft (2) and which is provided with an inlet distributing device (4) and an outlet distributing device (5) for cooling water, and an electromagnetic inductor (6) adapted to create a rotating radial magnetic field, which is housed in the annular tank (3), characterized in that the electromagnetic inductor (6) is disposed in an annular caisson (12) which is watertight with respect to the cooling water of the tank, which is filled with a secondary cooling fluid and which is itself disposed and supported in the annular tank (3) in such a manner that its walls (13, 14, 15 and 16) are spaced apart from the walls (17, 18, 26 and 16) of the annular tank (3) and of the casting shaft (2), at least the internal cylindrical wall (15) of the sealed annular caisson (12) being of non-magnetic material.
