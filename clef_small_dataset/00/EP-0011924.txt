<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a sealed product comprising  synthetic hydrophilic polymer compositions containing a vol­ atile active material which is released on exposure to the  atmosphere which are wrapped in a transparent film which is  impermeable to water vapour.  examples of packaging films  which are useful are:   barex/polythene and barex/polypropylene duplex lami­ nates, pvc/pvdc duples laminates pv/pvdc/polyethylene  and pvc/pvdc /polypropylene triplex laminates and polyes­ ter/pvc/ polyethylene triplex laminates.  these products exhibit a lesser tendency to exude the  volatile material even on prolonged storage as compared to  previously known products which were wrapped in  polyethylene films.  in a preferred form these products are  produced by preparing a blister pack from any suitable mater­ ial and using this as a mould into which the monomers are  poured and then polymerised.  such products are readily  adapted so as to be sold without further packaging or decora­ tion.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to synthetic hydrophilic polymer compositions which comprise an entrapped volatile active ingredient which is gradually released when the composition is exposed to the atmosphere. the volatile material is mostly commonly a fragrance i.e. a natural essential oil or synthetic perfume or a blend thereof but volatile insecticides bacteriocides pheronomes and fabric softeners may be entrapped to provide products with a consequent variety of applications. all these products are customarily sealed within a package which is substantially impermeable to the volatile material in order to prevent its premature release. a particular problem with systems based upon synthetic hydrophilic polymerised materials is the tendency of the volatile ingredient to exude from the polymer composition upon prolonged storage or exposure to high temperature producing a product which has an unattractive greasy or wet surface. the problem has been especially prevalent in products which were wrapped in a transparent polymeric film in order to maximise their visual appeal to the customer. we have now discovered that this problem of exudation may be alleviated using transparent packaging material which is sufficiently impermeable to water vapour as well as to the volatile substance. thus the products according to our invention retain their visual appeal and remain functional even on prolonged storage. from one aspect our invention provides a synthetic hydrophilic polymeric composition containing a volatile active ingredient which is capable of controlled release to the atmosphere and a package enclosing said polymeric composition to an extent sufficient substantially to prevent loss of active ingredient said package comprising a transparent film which is substantially impermeable to the active ingredient, and which over at least part of the surface of the package, constitutes the sole barrier between the polymeric composition and the outside atmosphere, said film having a water permeability less than 5 gm/m2 per day at 380c and 90,0 rh and sufficiently low substantially to prevent exudation of active ingredient on storage. it will be appreciated that no packaging material suitable for this type of product is totally impermeable to the passage of water vapour. hitherto transparent packaging films such as pvc film of 200 micron gauge having a permeability of from 5 to 6.0 gm/m2 per day au 38 and 90% relative humidity (rh) has been commonly used and products enclosed in such a film suffer from a tendency to exude the volatile substance. in order to effectively suppress the exudation of a typical product which will be stored for some months prior to sale, we have now discovered that the product should be packaged in a film having a water transmission of less than 5 preferably less than 3 say 2 and most preferably less than 1 expressed in gm/m2 per day at 380c and 90% rh. the maximum water permeability which can be tolerated depends on the particular polymer composition and active material. products having a high tendency to exude require a more water impermeable film in order to prevent high perceptible exudation. h tj t retrain the properties of being

what we claim is: 1. a synthetic hydrophilic polymeric composition containing  a volatile active ingredient which is capable of controlled  release to the atmosphere and a package enclosing said  polymeric composition to an extend sufficient substantially  to prevent loss of active ingredient said package comprising  a transparent film which is substantially impermeable to  the active ingredient and which over at least part of the  surface of the package constitutes the sole barrier between  the polymeric composition and the outside atmosphere  characterised in that the film has a water permeability  of less than 5 gm/m2 per day at 380c and 90% rh and  which is sufficiently low to prevent exudation of the  active ingredient on storage.   2. a composition according to claim 1, characterised in that  the film has a water transmission of-less than 3   gm/rn2     per day at 380c and 90% rh.   3. a composition according to claim 2 characterised in that  the film has a water transmission of less than 2 gm/m2  per day at 380c and 90% rh.     4. a composition according to claim 2, characterised in that  the film is a film selected from the group consisting of

laminates    5. a synthetic polymeric composition containing a volatile  active ingredient which is capable of controlled release  into the atmosphere in a package formed from substantially  air-impermeable film which has been formed by a process  of simultaneously manufacturing and packing which process  is characterised by the steps of (a) two pieces of  substantially air-impermeable film being shaped to form  opposite halves of a hollow mould having an opening at one  end, said pieces being joined to form the mould, a mixture  which is capable of forming the synthetic polymeric  composition being introduced into the mould and the  opening being filed with a member which is adopted to  form a base for the composition and is inert to the  ingredients thereof said member being joined to said  polymeric composition during or after the polymerisation  thereof.     6. a composition according to claim 5 formed by a process  characterised in that the two halves of the mould have  externally projecting flanges along corresponding sections  of their perimeters which come into contact when the two  halves are brought together.   7. a composition according to claim 6, formed by a process  characterised in that the flange projecting from one half  of the mould extends beyond that projecting from the  opposite half.   8. a composition according to either of claims 6 or 7 which
