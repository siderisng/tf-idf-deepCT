<ABSTRACT>
a differential gear mechanism of the limited slip type is  provided.  the mechanism includes a clutch, including a  plurality of discs (31 and 33), and a cam mechanism  including a main cam member (43) and an intermediate cam  member (45).  the intermediate cam member is splined to the  side gear (19), such that axial forces are not transmitted to  the side gear.  the main cam member (43) defines a set of  internal gear teeth (81), engaging an externally toothed  member (79) of an actuating mechanism (71).  the arrangeÂ­ ment of the cam members and the provision of the gear teeth  on the inner periphery of the main cam member results in a  differential gear mechanism having a substantially reduced  "bearing span", combined with a reduced casing diameter.
