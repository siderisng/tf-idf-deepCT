<ABSTRACT>
a high pressure diaphragm pump has a diaphragm 2  which carries a valve poppet 7 on its upper surface.  the valve  poppet 7 fits into a flared portion 6 of a passage 4 for hydrau足 lic fluid.  when the diaphragm 2 restores to the position shown  in figure 1, the valve poppet 7 closes the passage 4 and pre足 vents the diaphragm being punched back into the passage by  excessive fluid pressure on the opposite side of the di足 aphragm.  the diaphragm is made with flat edges 10, 11, 12 so  that it can easily be mounted in a housing by means of three  easily formed components 13, 14, 15.  a small axial compres足 sion between components 14 and 15 is all that is necessary to  keep the diaphragm in place during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
"high pressure diaphragm pump" this invention relates to a high pressure diaphragm pump comprising a housing containing at least one self-restoring diaphragm, the or each diaphragm being arranged within the housing so as to separate a space for receiving hydraulic fluid from a space for receiving fluid to be pumped, the space for receiving hydraulic fluid communicating with a hydraulic fluid supply via a passage. such a pump is disclosed in our u.s. patent specification 4 116 590. experience with the pumps previously disclosed has shown that the diaphragms are at risk if the outlet, or discharge, valves fail. if a discharge valve fails, the entry of the fluid to be pumped punches the diaphragm back against the wall of the hydraulic fluid space. hydraulic fluid enters this space through open passages, and if the diaphragm is punched back against the edges of the openings, it will wear. under such conditions, the diaphragm may eventually rupture. to overcome this disadvantage, it has been proposed to mount a circular component in the wall of the hydraulic fluid space, so that an annular gap is left around the edges of the circular component through which the hydraulic fluid enters the space. the edges of the component and the adjacent edges of the housing are of course rounded, but this alternative is not particularly satisfactory in that it requires an extra component of some size to be fixed in the housing and it does still leave a channel in the wall of the hydraulic space which the diaphragm can enter if it is punched back. the invention intends to overcome this disadvantage in a pump as set forth above, and to this end the diaphragm carries a closure member on its side facing the hydraulic fluid space for closing the passage when the diaphragm reaches the end of its intake movement. preferably, the passage enters the hydraulic fluid space via a flared passage portion, and the closure member is a poppet which fits into the flared portion to close the passage. the passage is preferably closed when there is still some hydraulic fluid remaining bfl t1 hydraulic fluid ace1 to act as a cushion in the event ol nlgn pressures occurring on the opposite side of the diaphragm, to prevent the central part of the diaphragm from touching any parts of the housing. the angle of the flared passage portion and of the edges of the poppet may be 450. this ensures that there is no chance of the poppet jamming in the passage portion when the diaphragm is required to carry out a pumping movement. the poppet does not have to form a fluid-tight seal in the flared passage portion. the diaphragm may be formed with an undercut recess which receives a flange of the poppet. no further fixing means are necessary. the passage for supplying hydraulic fluid preferably enteres the hydraulic fluid space in the centre thereof, and the closure member will then be in the centre of the diaphragm. the
