<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for the transfer of heating temperature from a primary circuit including a heat source to a number of secondary circuits each comprising a control valve and communicating with a consumer, via heat exchangers serially connected in said primary circuit, characterized in that between said primary circuit (1, 2) and each secondary circuit (6) there is provided a transfer circuit (5) for the transfer of heat by means of steam, said transfer circuit being connected at its primary circuit side to the respective heat exchanger (3) of the primary circuit (1, 2), and at its secondary circuit side, to a further heat exchanger, and being partially filled with a constant transfer medium controlled by a heat counter (11) and a temperature regulator (13) and protected by a safety valve (12).
