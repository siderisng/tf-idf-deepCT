<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a protective device for sawing machines with vertically movable sawing aggregate (20). It has a protective housing (34), which completely absorbs the circular saw blade (28) seated on a horizontally mounted saw assembly (20) on a horizontally mounted saw assembly (26) and is open below, so that the latter for sawing out this down is movable. In the housing wall (38) adjacent the saw assembly (20) adjacent side wall (38), an elongated recess (40) is arranged from top to bottom, via which the circular saw blade (28) supporting portion of the saw shaft (26) in the protective housing (34) protrudes. During the sa, this corrugated part moves along the recess (40). The latter is assigned to the protective housing (34) a cover member (44) which covers the upper out of passage of the circle saw blade (28) below the saw soil (26) present part of the recess (40) at least in an area in which the Scope of the circular saw blade (28) is located. When the saw feed is carried out, the cover member (44) is successively controlled in a release position to release this part of the recess (40) for the saw soil (26).
