<ABSTRACT>
method for introducing deoxy-desulphurizing substances  into liquid metal without the use of gaseous carrier.   the invention refers to the elimination of sulphur and/or  oxygen obtained in metal baths and to control the nature and  form of the sulphur and oxygen compounds produced as  results of deoxy-desulphurizing treatment.  a further object of the invention is to eliminate the  sulphur compounds from slag as volatile compounds in  order to avoid the sulphur to be transferred back to the bath  from the slag owing to the oxidizing effect of the air.  the  invention is based on the principle of adding the active  substances (3) to the bath through a special hollow carrier (4)  wherein they are contained in discrete quantities separated  by inert materials (2).  the inert material (2) can be metal  sheet, sponge metal or metalpowder and the metal can be  iron.  the inert material (2) can also take the form of other  compounds, e. g.  inert oxides, especially alumina.  mixtures of alkali and/or alkaline-earth halides and  oxides of the same elements are particularly useful for the  desulphurization of the whole system slag/metal by means  of sulphur and halide volatile compounds.
