<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and processes for the production of a  continuous rubber strip which is molded with surface designs,  such as tire treads, in the uncured state and then  cured, after removal from the mold, by heat or radiation is  disclosed.  in the apparatus the extruded rubber strip (2)  is passed between cooperating mold segments carried by  respective endless belts (3, 4) which, along with related  components, apply suitable temperatures and pressures to  the strip to produce the surface designs.  the molded uncured  rubber strip is removed from the molds and then  completely cured by radiation und/or heat.  process embodiments  are also disclosed wherein partial curing of the  rubber while in the molding apparatus is performed.
