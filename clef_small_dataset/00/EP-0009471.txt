<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a vacuum cleaner dust bag  with a rigid collar (11) having an inlet opening (12) for a  spigot tube (15) disposed on the vacuum cleaner.  the open­ ing is covered by an elastic diaphragm (13) having an  opening.  to prevent the bag from coming loose from the  spigot tube the opening of the bag has a large zone (12a)  and a smaller zone (12b), which are coherent, so that the  spigot tube (15) can be inserted through the large zone (12a)  and the bag be displaced laterally so that a flange (16) on  the spigot tube will engage with surrounding parts of the  small zone (12b) ot the opening.  the bag is moved to and  retained in this position by the elastic diaphragm (13) whose  opening (14) is disposed centrally relative to the zone (12b)  of small extension.
