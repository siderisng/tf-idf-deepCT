<ABSTRACT>
in a telephone system for digitalized speech transmission additional digital information is transferred without disturbing a speech communication (a) in progress.  at the sending side, time slots for the transmission of the additional digital information are created by momentarily suppressing the digital speech signals transmitted on a digital channel and, at the receiving side, the digital information is extracted from the time slots and replaced by digital signals (m) which constitute a continuous amplitude function starting from the amplitude value which was transmitted immediately before the time slot.  to distinguish the additional digital information from speech signals a special identifying code is added at the sending side.  the speech transmission may employ either delta modulation or pulse code modulation.
