<ABSTRACT>
a nail coating formulation which upon drying forms a  film which will adhere to keratin of the nail and has a moisture  vapor transmission from about 0. 1 to about 1. 6 mg. /cm. ²/hr. ,  said formulation comprising an aqueous emulsion of a  copolymer having a solids content of from about 30 to about  55 percent, the copolymer having a glass transition temperature  within the range of about -10°c.  to about 50°c.  as determined  by differential thermal analysis and being prepared by  the aqueous emulsion polymerization of two or more of the  following monomers, at least one of which is of formula i or  formula ii;    wherein r is c₁-c₂₀ alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, hydroxy- (c₁-c₄)-alkyl,  c₁-c₄ alkoxy- (c₁-c₄) alkyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, furyl,  c₁-c₄ alkylfuryl, tetrahydrofuryl, or c₁-c₄ alkyltetrahydrofufyl;  r¹ is hydrogen or methyl; and r² is hydrogen or c₁-c₃ alkyl,  subject to the limitation that when r is one of monomers is  c₁-c₄ alkoxy- (c₁-c₄) alkyl, then r in the other monomer is a  group other than c₁-c₄ alkoxy- (c₁-c₄) alkyl or hydroxy- (c₁-c₄)  alkyl.
