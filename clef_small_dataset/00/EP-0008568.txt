<ABSTRACT>
a method and a boiler for heating a heat-transfer medium  such as water in a heating system.  the combustion gases are  brought into heat-transfer contact with the heat-transfer  medium over a large specific, heat-transfer surface.  the heat-足 transfer medium flows in the opposite direction to the com足 bustion gases and the gases are caused to flow downwardly  and are thereby cooled to a temperature which is lower than  the temperature at the outlet for the medium heated by the  gases before the gases are discharged to atmosphere.  the boiler is fired by oil and/or gas and the combustion  chamber (16) is arranged immediately above one end of the  smoke-pipes (22).  the other end of the smoke-pipes (22) dis足 charge into a collecting chamber (24) provided with an outlet  (28) for the combustion gases.  the collecting chamber (24) is  provided with an outlet (34) for condensation from the com足 bustion gases.
