<ABSTRACT>
novel polyphosphazene copo)ymers are prepared which  contain units represented by the formulas:    wherein x is -o-nr₂ in which r is selected from the group  consisting of alkyl groups containing from 1 to 8 carbon  atoms, and cycloalkyl groups containing from 3 to 12 ring  carbon atoms; and wherein x′ is selected from the group  consisting of substituted and unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy,  amino and mercapto groups.  the polymers are prepared by reacting a poly(dich­ lorophosphazene) of formula -(npcl₂)n-, wherein n is from 20  to 50,000 with a hydroxylamine of formula r₂n-oh, r being  c₁₋₈-alkyl or c₃₋₁₂-cycloalkyl and an alcohol, a phenol, an  amine or a mercaptan in the presence of a tertiary amine.  the polymers of the invention can be utilized to form  films and may also be utilized in applications such as mold­ ings, coatings and the like.
