<ABSTRACT>
a drainage device 20, which is arranged to be moun­ ted in a papermaking machine beneath a moving screen of  the machine so as to support the screen and to engage its  undersurface as it passes thereover to extract liquid down­ wardly through the screen from the material carried by the  screen, comprises a main body portion 50 and multiplici­ ty of wear resistant ceramic wafers 40 bonded thereto with  the upper surface of the wafers 40 providing the device  with a wear surface for engaging the undersurface of the  screen as it passes over the device.  the method of fabri­ cating the drainage device 20 includes the steps of posi­ tioning and holding the multiplicity of ceramic wafers 40,  wear surface downwards, on a base plate 34, metering a  predetermined amount of the bonding material 47 onto the  exposed surfaces of the wafers 40, and positioning the  main body portion 50 over the wafers 40 in engagement  with the bonding material 47.
