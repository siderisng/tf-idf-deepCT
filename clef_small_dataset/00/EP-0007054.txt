<ABSTRACT>
an improved whippable whey protein containing com­ position is provided comprising a whey protein containing  product having at least 20% soluble whey protein, and an  enzyme modified wheat protein in combination with a  member selected from the group consisting of gelatin, gelatin  and a water soluble polyphosphate, a gum and mixtures  thereof, the whey protein containing product being prepared  by one of the following processes:   a) ultrafiltration of cottage cheese whey;   b) adjusting the ph of a solution containing whey protein  to a value of from about 11 to about 13, thereafter reducing the  ph to a value of from about 4 to about 6 to yield a water  solution of a water soluble whey product and insoluble whey  solids and separating the water soluble whey final product;   c) hydrolyzing the insoluble whey solids of step b) at a ph  of between about 11 and about 13; or   d) combining liquid whey with an effective amount of  sodium lauryl sulfate to form a whey protein-sodium lauryl  sulfate complex which precipitates from solution, followed by  reducing the sodium lauryl sulfate content of the complex to  less than 0. 1% by weight based on the dry weight of the  complex.  the products prepared using the whey protein containing  products of steps a) and b) can be used as egg albumen  replacers in whipped products such a meringues, nougat  candy and divinity candy.  the products using the whey pro­ teins of steps a), c) and d) can be used as egg albumen  replacers in preparing soft meringues and cakes such as yel­ low or sponge cake.

<DESCRIPTION>
new whipping composition of modified ey protein and additives background of tbe present invention 1. field of the invention the present invention relates to improved whippable egg albumen replacement compositions containing cheese whey protein. 2. description of the prior art egg albumen is a known aerating agent in numerous food products. due to the expense of egg albumen, many attempts have been made to duplicate the aerating qualities of egg albumen with less expensive materials. in recently issued u.s. patent no. 4,089,987 (may 16, 1978), entitled whipping composition of modified whey protein and additives (p. k. chang), there is disclosed various compositions which can be used to replace egg albumen in hard meringue including an isolated whey protein and: 1) gelatin 2) gelatin and a water soluble polyphosphate 3) a gum, and 4) mixtures thereof. while these products can provide effective replacement of egg albumen in most situations, it has been found that these replacers are somewhat deficient in aerating ability when compared to egg albumen. while these prior art materials are able to foam, hold sugar and heat set, improvements in the functionality, stability and heat set characteristics of the foat are required. brief description of tre invention in accordance with the present invention, an improved whippable whey protein containing composition is provided comprising at least 70 by weight on a dry solids basis of a whey protein containing product having a least 20 soluble whey protein, the percentage being by weight based on the total weight of dry solids in said whey protein containing product and an enzyme hydrolyzed wheat protein in combination with a member selected from the group consisting of gelatin, gelatin and a water soluble polyphosphate, a gum and mixtures thereof1 said whey protein containing product being prepared by any one of the following alternative methods: : a) ultrafiltration of cottage cheese whey or b) adjusting the ph of a solution containing a whey protein to a value of from about 11 to about 13, thereafter reducing the pr to a value of from about 4 to about 6 to yield a water solution of a water soluble whey product and insoluble whey solids and separating the water soluble whey final product; or c) hydrolyzing the insoluble whey solids of step b) at a pr of between about 11 and about 13, or d) combining liquid whey with an effective amount of sodium lauryl sulfate to form a whey proteinsodium lauryl sulfate complex which precipitates from solution, followed by reducing the sodium lauryl sulfate content of the complex to less than 0.1% by weight based on the dry weight of the complex. the products prepared using the whey protein containing products of steps a) and b) can be used as egg albumen replacers in whipped products such as meringue, nougat candy and divinity candy. the whey proteins of steps a), c) and d) can be used as albumen replacers in preparing soft meringue and cakes such as yellow or sponge cake. the compositions of the

what is claimed is:    1. an improved whippable whey protein containing composition comprising at least   70%    of a whey protein containing product having at least-20 parts soluble whey protein per 100 parts of dry solids in said whey protein containing product in combination with a member selected from the group consisting of from about   1    to about   10%    gelatin; from about   1    to about   1 3    gelatin and from about 5% to about   15    of a water soluble polyphosphate, the additive total of gelatin and phosphate not to exceed about   15ffi;    from about 0.5% to about 5% of a gum, and mixtures thereof; and from about 5% to-about 30% of an enzyme hydrolyzed wheat protein;  said whey protein containing product being selected from the group consisting of:  a) a whey protein concentrate derived by the ultrafiltration of cottage cheese whey;  b) a water soluble low molecular weight whey protein product prepared by adjusting the ph of a   solution    containing a whey protein to a value of from about 11 to about 13, thereafter reducing the ph to a value of from about 4 to about 6 to yield a water solution of a water soluble whey product and insoluble whey solids, separating the water soluble whey final product and   drying-the    same;  c) a whey protein product prepared by hydrolyzing the insoluble whey solids of step b) at a ph ofbetween about 11 and about 13 for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to hydrolyze the same;  and  d) a precipitated whey protein prepared by combining liquid whey with an effective amount of sodium lauryl sulfate to form a sodium lauryl sulfate  protein complex which   precipitåates    from solution, followed by reducing the sodium lauryl sulfate content of the complex to less than   0.1%    by weight based on the dry weight of the complex, all percentages are by weight based on the total weight of the whey protein containing composition.    2. the whippable composition as recited in claim 1 wherein said member is gelatin and a water soluble polyphosphate, said polyphosphate preferably being sodium hexametaphosphate.    3. the whippable   composition    as recited in claim 1 wherein said member is a gum selected from the group consisting of carrageenan, sodium alginate, potassium alginate, accacia,   carboxymethylcellulose,    guar, xanthan and mixtures thereof and preferably carrageenan.    4. the whippable composition as recited in claim 1 wherein said solution containing whey protein in step b) is the first fraction obtained by passing partially delactosed cheese whey through a bed of molecular sieve resin.     5. the whippable composition as recited in claim 1, step b) wherein the ph of said solution containing whey protein is adjusted to about 11.5 to about 11.9 for from 1 to 3 hours followed by reducing the ph to a value within the range of from about 4.2 to about 5.0.    7. the whippable composition as recited in claim 1 wherein said liquid whey of step d) is the first fraction obtained by passing partially delactosed cheese whey through a bed of molecular sieve resin.    8. the whippable composition as recited in claim 1 wherein said sodium lauryl sulfate content  in step d) is reduced by passing the complex through an ion exchange resin in the hydroxy form.    9. the whippable composition as recited in claim 1 wherein said   enzymehydrolyzed    wheat protein contains from 0% to about 10% sugar and 0% to about 20% starch.
