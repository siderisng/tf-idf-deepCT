<ABSTRACT>
methods and apparatus for making rings from tube stock  (10) by a part-off rolling tool (12, 15) which is advanced radially  into the tube stock (10) to form successive rings (45), e. g.  an­ nular blanks for subsequent roll forming into bearing rings.  the  tube stock (10) is indexed forward after separation of each ring  (45).  errors in the length of tube stock indexed forward each  time are contained by forming a locating groove (47) on the  tube stock (10) by means of a grooverolling tool (40) set at an  appropriate axial distance from the part-off rolling tool (12, 15)  and moved radially with it.  in the next cycle the groove (47) au­ tomatically centres the part-off tool (12, 15) as the latter begins  its advance into the stock (10), so as to give the correct axial  length of the finished ring (45).  the part-off tool (12, 15) is  stopped before fully penetrating the tube wall, which is then  machined.  final separation takes place during this machining  or in a subsequent finishing pass by the part-off tool (12, 15).
