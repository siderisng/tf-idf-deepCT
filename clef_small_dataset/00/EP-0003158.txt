<ABSTRACT>
oxidation and ammoxidation caytalysts are disclosed  which have the empirical formula sbavbticox, wherein a is at  least 6, b is 1, and c is a number such that the ratio c/a is at  least 0. 5, and x is a number taken to satisfy the valence  requirements of the sb, v and ti present in the catalyst.  such  catalysts may be optionally supported on conventional  supports, or may be unsupported.  they can be made by  drying a slurry of sb, v and ti compounds in the desired  atomic ratio to form a catalyst precursor that is then calcined.   their use in oxidation and ammoxidation of olefines, e. g.   production of acrylonitrile from propylene, is described.
