<ABSTRACT>
an i. c.  engine fuel control system includes a closed loop  roughness control, utilizing a roughness sensor circuit (11, 12,  13, 14), an integrator (15) which integrates the error between  the roughness signal and a reference signal and modifies the  fuel flow to the engine via a main fuel control (19) with a  variable frequency clock (18).  during acceleration and decel­ eration the closed loop is interrupted by means of a circuit  including two differentiators (24, 25) which are sensitive to  throttle opening (speed demand) and actual speed respec­ tively, and switches (16, 30) controlled by these differen­ tiators.
