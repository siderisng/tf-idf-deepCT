<ABSTRACT>
a baffle system for use on a plate for mass transfer operaÂ­ tions comprises at least one channel 1, the surface 5 of the  channel through which a two-phase mixture of liquid and  vapour leaves the channel having a plurality of holes 8.  a  deflector 9 is immediately adjacent to each hole, and the  deflector is in line to deflect the two-phase mixture towards  one end of the channel 1.  a liquid return zone is defined by the  space 13 between two channels 1 and 2 laterally adjacent to  each other.  disengaged liquid from the two-phase mixture  collects in the liquid return zones 13 and passes through slots  10 in the channel sides 3 and 4 to re-enter the channel.  the  baffle system has an inlet weir 4 which blocks off one end of  the or each two-phase channel, so that inlet liquid is fed to the  liquid return zones.  an outlet weir blocks off the other end of  the or each two-phase channel and the liquid return zones.
