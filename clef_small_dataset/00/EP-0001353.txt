<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic disk and card storage enclosure (10) is configured  as a book-like pair of overlying covers (12,13) that are  hinged along a side (20) analogous to a binding.  one of the  covers (14) has a pivotal tray-like insert (40) connected thereto  that can be laid within the enclosure formed between the two  covers (12, 14).  the tray-like enclosure (40) can store disks (16)  in their entirety or be divided with a wall to provide two  adjunct compartments for rectangular magnetic cards.  the  other cover (12) which is not connected to the insert has a  ledge or side wall (30) therearound which forms an internal  cavity or enclosure for the entire insert (40) to be laid therein  and enclosed when the top and bottom covers (12,14) are laid  in overlying relationship to each other.  the insert (40) has a  pair of flexible fan tabs (58,60) which can receive the magnetic  disks (16) or cards therebehind for spreading them in a flexible  and facile manner.  the entire case (10) can be formed from  plastics with living hinges for opening and closing the case.
