<ABSTRACT>
a process for the production of basic magnesium sul­ phonates comprising carbonating a mixture containing:   (a) an oil soluble sulphonic acid or sulphonate   (b) a stoicheiometric excess of magnesium compound  above that required to react with (a)   (c) a hydrocarbon solvent   (d) a c₈ to c₁₀ carboxylic acid   (e) water 
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to the production of basic magnesium sulphonates. the basic magnesium sulphonates produced by the present invention are particularly useful as additives for lubricating oils and the present invention also provides lubricating oils containing these basic magnesium sulphonates. the term basic sulphonate is used to describe materials containing a stoicheiometric excess of magnesium compared to that required to neutralize the sulphonic acid. basic magnesium sulphonates are well known as is their use as additives for lubricants and many methods have been proposed for their production the preferred techniques being the carbonation of an oil solution of a reaction mixture containing a sulphonic acid or sulphonate, an excess of a compound of magnesium generally the alkoxide, oxide or hydroxide, usually a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of reaction promoter systems often comprising an alcohol and/or water sometimes together with a copromoter. it is important that where the highly basic sulphonates are to be used as additives for lubricating oils they be not too viscous, are free of sediment, are soluble in the oil and do not cause the lubricating oil to be hazy. it is also preferred that they have as high a total base number (tbn), being the number of milligrams of kor equivalent to 1 gram of the product when titrated with strong acid, as possible since this results in the most economic use of the metal. it is also important that the compound perform well as an additive in an oil in use in an engine. from an economic point of view it is of added importance that the product once made may be filtered as rapidly as possible. it is well known that the production of basic magnesium sulphonates presents greater difficulties than producing barium and calcium sulphonates and many of the first techniques proposed for producing magnesium sulphonates required magnesium metal as starting material, as for example in united states patent 3158009. since then various reaction promoter systems have been proposed for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates from magnesium oxide. for example, u.k. patent 1166744 is concerned with the use of mixtures of alcohol, water and amines as promoters; u.k. patent 1297150 describes the use of certain oil soluble carboxylic fatty acids and water whilst u.k. patent 1399092 relates to the use of amine salts of carboxylic acids, alcohol and water. we have now discovered a new promoter system which is effpctlve either as sole promoter or together with other promoters in the production of a highly basic magnesium sulphonates from magnesium oxide. in particular we have discovered that by using certain selected carboxylic acids as promoters a product with improved filtration for a given basicity may be obtained. the present invention therefore provides 2 process or the production of basic magnesium sulphonates comprising carbonating a mixture containing: (a) an oil soluble sulphonic acid or sulphonate. (b) a stoicheiometric excess of a magnesia: compound above then required to react with (a). (c) a hydrocarbon solvent. (d) a c8 to c10 carboxylic acid.
