<ABSTRACT>
an operating system for use with relatively soft building material (aerated cement or such like) consists of an expanding fastener (10) which is either directly hammered in or is inserted in a blind hole which has been provided in the building material principally in accordance with a specific process using a special tool.  the expanding fastener (10) is characterised by a glass-fibre reinforcement (26) and special moulding.  the use of the tool causes compression and ejection of the borings leading to the formation of a truncated cone at the base of the blind hole, which presses the expanding anchors (16) of the fastener apart.  <image>
