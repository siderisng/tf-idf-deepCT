<ABSTRACT>
dehydration of a gaseous hydrocarbon mixture contain­ ing water, using methanol as the dehydration agent, and  recovery of a condensed fraction of said mixture can be  achieved simultaneously and with improved use of the  methanol and improved separation of the mixture, and in  apparatus which can be employed on an installation such as a  tanker ship which is liable to movement and/or tilting, by  chilling a gaseous composition comprising the water-­ containing mixture and methanol in passageway (18) of a  reflux exchanger (6) in which condensed liquids flow down­ wards in direct contact with the rising gas and are collected in  a gas/liquid separator (4) from which a condensed hydrocar­ bon phase and an aqueous phase can be recovered sepa­ rately; dehydrated gas being recovered from the top of the  passageway.
