<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an addition for outboard motor, Z-drives for boats od. Like. whose exhaust gas is normally directed through the propeller hub (2) into the water. By means of a valve system (10-20), which is preferably transformed from the direction of rotation of the propeller automatically, the exhaust gas is derived with the reverse rotating propeller in a region which is outside the propeller SESS, while the exhaust gas in the future rotating propeller in the usual way flows out through the propeller hub. The success of the invention is in a significant increase in the propeller thrust with reverse drive. The valve system consists in an embodiment of a rotary valve arrangement (10) at the free end of the propeller in conjunction with an auxiliary outlet for the exhaust gases in reverse drive. It consists in another embodiment of an axially on the propeller shaft propeller with a locking washer at the free end of the propeller shaft, which releases the exhaust opening of the propeller in its one position and extends in the other position, in the other position the displacement of the propeller A ring gap between the propeller hub and the shaft of the boat motor is released, by which the exhaust gas can flow out during reverse drive.
