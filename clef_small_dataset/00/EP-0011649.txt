<ABSTRACT>
a padding alloy based on nickel comprising 0. 05-1. 5% by  weight of boron, 3-7% by weight of silicon, 7. 5-35% by weight  of chromium, 0. 05-1. 5% by weight of carbon, if desired, with  the addition of at most 30% by weight of iron or at most 5% by  weight of tungsten or both, the remainder being substantially  nickel, the weight ratio of said silicon to said boron being at  least 3. 3.  this alloy is high in toughness and has no fear of  cracks in padded layers, and further has high wear-resistance  and corrosion-resistance.  the corrosion resistance of this  alloy may be remarkably improved by the addition of 0. 1-3%  by weight of tin or 0. 1-3% by weight of tantalum or both.  this  alloy is adapted to be used for padding alloys for parts of  various kinds of plants, machines or equipments.
