<ABSTRACT>
a microwave filter comprising within a conductive cas­ ing, a plurality of resonant transmission lines (10-12) arranged  parallel between opposed end walls (23, 24) of the casing, a  plurality of shielding members (16, 17) each located between  adjacent transmission lines, and a capacitive interstage coupl­ ing member disposed transverse to the transmission line.  the  interstage coupling member comprises a dielectric member  (30) and a plurality of conductive regions (31-33) arranged  successively thereon so as to establish capacitive coupling  between adjacent conductive regions.  each transmission line  is connected at one end to a side wall (21) of the casing and  supported at the other end by the dielectric member (30) in  electrical contact with a respective one of the conductive reg­ ions (31-33), whereby the interstage coupling between the  transmission lines is provided by the capacitively coupled  conductive regions.
