<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a door, window or frame com足 prising a plastic enclosure in which a pane (2) or a panel can be  set, this enclosure being composed of main sections (1) pro足 vided with a rabbet (4) against which the pane (2) or panel can  be placed, and a fixation section (6) securing the pane (2) or  panel against the rabbet (4) optionally with intermediate seal足 ing means (5,7) being used, which fixation section (6) can be  attached to the main section (1) by means of one or more snap  interlocks.  the invention is characterized in that the fixation section  (6) is connected to the main section (1) on the side away from  the pane (2) or panel in that a bent edge of the fixation section  (6) is made to cooperate with a bent edge or groove of the  main section (1) by hooking-in the fixation section (6) and  turning it on an axis parallel to itself, the edges or grooves  being so designed that the connection can be disconnected  only by turning the fixation section (6) back, with the connec足 tion on the side near the plane of the pane (2) or panel being a  snap interlock securing the fixation section (6) in the position  reached after turning.

<DESCRIPTION>
door, window or frame the invention relates to a door, window or frame comprising a plastic enclosure in which a pane or a panel can be set, this enclosure being composed of main sections provided with a rabbet against which the pane or panel can be placed, and a fixation section k , k securing the pane or panel against the rabbet, optionally with intermediate sealing means being used, which fixation section can be r attached to the main section by means of one or more snap interlocks. this type of door, window or frame is known from the netherlands patent application no, 7009258. the fixation section described therein is attached to the main section by means of two snap interlocks. this construction involves the drawback that the fixation section - also called glazing bead - can easily removed by unauthorized persons. the pane or panel can then be removed noiselessly. is is the object of the invention to obviate this drawback, and to provide a door, window or frame so constructed as to make it very difficult, if not impossible, to avoid damage in removing the fixation section with a view to taking the pane or panel out of its enclusere. according to the invention this is achieved in that the fixation section is connected to the main section on the side away from the pane or panel in that a bent edge of the fixation section is made to cooperate with a bent edge or groove of the main section by hooking-in the fixation section and turning it on an axis parallel to itself, the edges or grooves being so designed that the connection can be disconnected only by turning the fixation section back, and in that the connection on the side near the plane of the pane or panel is a snap interlock securing the fixation section in the position reached after turning. preferably, the snapping movement of this interlock is towards the plane of the pane or panel, because this ensures better compressions of the sealing means. in a preferred embodiment of the invention the main section has a bent edge and the fixation section has a cooperating bent edge and a straight edge, this bent edge and straight edge gripping around the bent edge of the main section. the fixation section may also be attached to a door or winnow frame to serve as stop for the door or window. the invention also relates to a door or window frame provided with a fixation section serving as stop for the door or window, with the frame being connected to the stop section on the side away from the plane of the door or window in that a bent edge of the stop section is made to cooperate with a bent edge or groove of the frame by hooking-in the stop section and turning it on an axis parallel to itself, the edges and sections being so designed that the connection can be disconnected only by
