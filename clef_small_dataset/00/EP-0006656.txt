<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the threading of minerals by a borehole, which consists of the direction substantially from the shoves (8, 9, 10) connected to a drill bit (8, 9, 10), which in the stretched state in the contained in the mineral rock Borehole can be brought in and out of means, with the help of which the shots are then brought into zig-zag position and reciprocated in the axial senses, wipes on the joint connections of the shots of the shots, which dissolve the mineral outside the borehole wall and remove with the help of thickness by the same perforated bore. The present invention is particularly characterized by the fact that the mutually articularly biased which shots are in the stretched state in a pouring in the borehole sleeve (5), which has one or more longitudinal slots (6, 7) through which the shots from the Sleeve can protrude out with the sleeve cooperating means which can exert an axial force on the outer shots. The axial movement of the Vorrich Tung can be caused by a hydraulic pressure cylinder (1, 48, 50) near the sleeve.
