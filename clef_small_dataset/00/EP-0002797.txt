<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing a semiconductor arrangement which contains in addition to active components resistor areas, the formation of the resistance areas by means of ion implantation after the occupancy of the semi-term layer with a diffusion source layer for first doping areas of the active, component, z.b.After the basic occupancy, but in front of the associated high temperature turprint.z.b.Basic driving step.The tempering of the ion implanted resistance areas takes place with utilization of the formation of further doping areas of the active components, for.b.Emitter regions, utilized high temperature treatment.
