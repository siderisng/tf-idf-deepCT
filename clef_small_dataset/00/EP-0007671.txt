<ABSTRACT>
a colour television display device comprising a deflection  coil unit with a deflection coil for the vertical deflection which  coil is divided into two coil halves (l₁, l₂).  a balancing resistor  (r₁, r₃, r₂) by means of convergence can be corrected is in a  parallel branch.  a static convergence error introduced by this  resistor owing to the non-zero inductance (i₁, i₂) of the deflec­ tion coil is corrected by means (d₁, d₂, d₃, d₄; z₁, z₂) for  decreasing the voltage present across the balancing resistor  during the trace period (t) of the deflection current (id) by a  direct voltage in such a way that the voltage across the resis­ tor is more decreased after the centre instant (t₀) of the trace  period than before and that the correction current (i₀) at and  about said centre instant is substantially zero.
