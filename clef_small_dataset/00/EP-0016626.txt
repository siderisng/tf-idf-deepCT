<ABSTRACT>
where power take-off apparatus is driven by an internal  combustion engine (10), the rate of rotation of the power  take-off output shaft (17) is usually controlled by means of a  manual or foot control arrangement.  however, especially in  the case of the engine being of the fuel injection type, such  control may be coarse and, as a result, it may be difficult to  maintain the desired steady engine speed.  control apparatus  is now provided comprising a sensor (18) producing pulses  at a rate proportional to the rate of rotation of the power  take-off output shaft (17), a control unit (20) which receives  the pulses and distinguishes between rates above and below  at least one reference rate by responding to the time  between successive pulses, and an electromechanical  actuator arrangement (21) which acts on a fuel flow control  (22).  the control unit (20) provides an output signal which  determines whether or not the fuel flow control (22) operates  to reduce the flow rate of the fuel to the engine (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
vehicles equipped with power take-off apparatus this invention relates to vehicles equipped with power take-off apparatus. motor vehicles are known which have an internal combustion engine of the injection type which uses diesel oil or gasoline and consequently has a fuel pump for controlling the rate of flow of fuel to the engine, the vehicle being equipped with power take-off apparatus which can be driven by this engine. there is, however, a difficulty involved in the use of the power take-off apparatus of such a vehicle in that the control over the rate of flow of fuel given by the usual manual or foot control arrangement for the fuel pump is very coarse in the middle range of rates rotation of the engine output shaft. fig 1 of the accompanying drawings shows an example of engine speed in r.p.m. against fuel input for an injection engine. it will be seen that control is good at low and high r.p.m. but very difficulty in the range between 1,000 r.p.m. and 2,000 r.p.m. the present invention has arisen out of an attempt to overcome this difficulty in a way which does not involve the use of very complex and expensive fuel pumps which, while being satisfactory for power take-off requirements, are detrimental to the road performance of the vehicle where the engine is the engine which drives the powered road wheels of the vehicle. however, the invention is not limited to use in connection with vehicles employing injection engines for driving power take-off apparatus but applies whether the engine is either of the injection type or has other means controlling the flow of fuel to the engine, and applies whether or not the engine which is used to drive the power take-off apparatus is the sane engine which drives road wheels of the vehicle. the present invention applies to a vehicle having an internal combustion engine and means for controlling the rate of flow of fuel to the said engine in operation, the vehicle being equipped with power take-off apparatus including a rotary power take-off output shaft which can be driven by the said engine. in accordance with the invention, means are provided for sensing rotation of the said output shaft and producing in response thereto a repetitive signal in which the duration of the repeated element is inversely related to the rate of rotation of the said output shaft, and electrical control means are coupled to the sensing means to receive the repetitive signal and so are coupled to the means for controlling the rate of supply of fuel that in use whenever the rate of rotation of the said output shaft exceeds a predetermined value when increasing from zero, the electrical control means so operate that the means for controlling the rate of supply of fuel responds by reducing the rate of supply of fuel. the electrical control means may be such that the means for controlling the rate of supply of fuel does not allow the rate of supply
