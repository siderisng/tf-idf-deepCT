<ABSTRACT>
a unit set assembly of multiple plies includes superimposed  top (11), intermediate (12) and bottom (13) plies each  being devoid of any tear lines which may form a stub, and  each being coated on selected surfaces thereof with chemicals  which are capable of reacting with one another to produce  a coloured mark.  the top (11) and bottom (13) plies are  interconnected by means of a removable glue flap (14), and  portions of the glue extend through holes (17) lying along a  margin of the bottom ply (13) so as to thereby interconnect the  intermediate (12) and bottom (13) plies together.  the top ply is  coated front and back and the intermediate ply is coated on its  back surface with a micro-encapsulated colour precursor,  while the bottom ply is coated front and back and the top  surface of the intermediate ply is coated with a record  developing material.  upon application of pressure to the set,  coloured marks are formed on the intermediate and bottom  ply top surface as the reactive components of the coatings on  mating surfaces react.  the plies are capable of re-arrangement  such that by removal of the intermediate ply and  by placing the backs of the top and bottom plies in mating  engagement coloured marks are produced on the backs of the  plies as the reactive components of the coating of these  mating surfaces are forced into reactive contact upon the  application of pressure to the back of the set.  the unit set may also include at least two of such intermediate  plies, similarly coated as the intermediate ply of the  three-ply set so that, upon application of pressure to the set,  coloured marks are formed on both intermediate and bottom  ply top surfaces as the reactive components of the coatings on  mating surfaces react.  portions of the glue extend through  aligned holes lying along the margins of the lower intermediate  and bottom plies, the latter being smaller than the former  so as to mask portion of the glue extending therethrough.  the  plies are capable of re-arrangement as in the three-ply set  upon removal of both intermediate plies.
