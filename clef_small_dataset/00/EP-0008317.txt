<ABSTRACT>
a connection fitting (10; 10 ') for connecting preferably right-angled plates-shaped furniture parts (12; 14) consists of two each one of the furniture parts associated fused parts (20, 24; 20', 24 '; 80), which in the appropriate one Recesses (18; 22) of the furniture parts Fastenable plastic plug-in pots are formed. The first fitting part (20; 20 '; 80) is fastened in a recess (18) broken to the end edge of the associated furniture part (12) and so abge on the side associated with this breakthrough so that this flattening (28) flush flush to the end edge ( 16) runs. In the interior of the first fitting part (20; 20 '), a rotary wedge (46; 46') is mounted with a screw-shaped locking wedge (54) which is made from a retracted in the fitting part (20; 20 '; 80) into one from the Flattening (28) Preting locking position is rotatable. the second, in the intended connection position on the flattening (28) of the first fitting part (20; 20 '; 80) applied second fitting part (24; 24') has a tanned recess (66) into which the locking wedge (54) engages in the locking position, wherein by the screw shaped design with increasing rotation of the rotation of the rotary wedge (46; 46 ') a suit is achieved, which braces the fused parts (20, 24; 20', 24 '; 80) with each other.
