<ABSTRACT>
1.  an internal combustion engine nameable combi-­ stroke engine in which the crank-shafts have such a posi­ tion with regard to each other that the smallest volume of  the combustion chamber is attained when the pistons con­ nected to one crank-shaft have passed the highest dead  point in order to get a higher output or power.  2.  an internal combustion engine nameable combi-­ shaft engine.  in such an engine the linear motion of a pi­ ston is transformed in rotation by means of a crank-shaft  combination.  in this combination one or more crank-shafts  can be considered as crank or cranks for a secondary  crank-shaft in order to get a higher output and torque.  3.  an internal combustion engine can be composed  by using the abstract 1 and abstract 2 in one engine.  4.  transformation of rectilinear motion into rotation  by means of combi-shaft can also be used in other con­ struction than internal combustion engines.
