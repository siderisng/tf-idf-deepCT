<ABSTRACT>
1.  an automatic braking device for a system provided with at least one rotary member carried by an equally rotary carrier which is itself fitted to a stationary element and connected to a driving motor, for example for a wheelchair for a physically handicapped person, comprising two wheels rotatably fitted to a shaft coupled to an electric motor and itself rotatably fitted on the framework of said wheelchair, characterized in that it comprises two coupling or similar members (10, 15) in unit, respectively, with the aforesaid carrier (3) and the rotary member (7), a blade spring (13) of arcuate shape housed in a circular recess (2a) of the stationary element (1) and capable of being deformed resiliently under the action of a tangential force by reduction or increase of its radius in the direction of the said force, the said coupling members (10, 15) and the said blade (13) being arranged to come into mutual engagement so that the members (10, 15) become locked together in rotation and that the blade (13) is exposed to a tangential force which moves it away from or on the contrary applies it against, the inner surface of the said recess (2a) in dependance upon whether the motive action is attributable to the carrier (3) or to the aforesaid rotary member (7), respectively.
