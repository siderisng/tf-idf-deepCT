<ABSTRACT>
rigid thermoplastic sheet materials of which the polymeric  constituent is predominantly vinyl chloride polymer,  which contain glass fibres lying in, or substantially in, the  plane of the sheet the amount of glass fibre being in the  range 5 to 30 per cent by weight of the material.  a particulate filler is also present in the sheet in an  amount in the range 20 to 50 per cent by weight, the  amount of the polymeric constituent of the sheet being 30  to 75 per cent by weight.  a sheet is made by building up successive very thin  layers on a calender roll to ensure that the fibres are lying  in the plane of the sheet.  several such sheets are then  laminated together under heat and pressure.  an extra reinforcing layer of a material such as a  cloth, mat or scrim can be incorporated.  the resultant rigid sheets are suitable for moulding.   if desired decorative surface layers can be laminated onto  the sheets and the sheets are then suitable for use, for instance,  as wall panelling.
