<ABSTRACT>
separate stripping (14) and rectifying (16) sections are  arranged in tandem, each section being segregated into a  plurality of vapor liquid contact stages (24-32, 34-42).  the  rectifying section (16) is operated at a higher temperature  than the stripping section (14) by compressing (66) vapor  from the stripping section (14) prior to introducing the vapor  into the rectifying section (16).  thermal energy is conserved  during the distillation process by transferring thermal energy  from the rectifying section (16) to the stripping section (14)  with a plurality of heat pipes (84-87).
