<ABSTRACT>
compositions comprising (i) thermoplastic polyester of  aliphatic diol, and dicarboxylic acid, at least 95% mole of said  acid being terephthalic acid and (ii) inert particulate nucleat­ ing agent further contain, as a crystallization promoter, (iii)  oligomeric polyester of organic dicarboxylic acid having 2 to 8  carbon atoms and organic polyol and having a flory interac­ tion patameter with said polyester below or equal to 0. 2.  the  compositions are useful moulding compounds, the crystalli­ zation promoter enabling crystalline moulded products to be  obtained at low mould temperatures.  moulding processes of  the invention are carried out at less than 100°c mould temp­ eratures.

<DESCRIPTION>
polyester compositions and processes for moulding them this invention is concerned with polyester compositions and processes for moulding them. the field of this invention is the improvement of the crystallization rate and moulding behaviour of polyesters, in particular poly(alkylene terephthalate). the use of inert particulate nucleating agents to promote crystallization of poly(alkylene terephthalate) is very well known. mold temperatures of at least 120c and optimumly 1400c in the case of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (pet) have generally been necessary for injection molded engineering applications. in the case of pet, because of its low rate of crystallization at desirable molding temperatures of less than 1000c, it has not attained widespread use as an engineering plastic. when pet is molded with conventional nucleating agents at temperatures below 100 c, it generally has poor physical properties, surface appearance and dimensional stability due to insufficient crystallization. various attempts have been made to improve the crystallization rate of pet. for example, the use of poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(propylene oxide) having hydroxyl functionality has been suggested in combination with nucleating agents; however, this method is undesirable because the pet reacts with the hydroxyl functionality to give a resin with lower molecular weight and poorer physical properties. the use of low molecular weight inert organic solvents such as benzophenone and phthalate plasticizers such as dioctyl phthalate have been suggested, but the use of such plasticizers alone is not desirable because they cause processing difficulties due to their high volatility under drying or processing conditions for pet, and tend to migrate to the surface of a molded specimen. solvents such as dibutyl tin dilaurate have been suggested, but these are toxic materials and would be undesirable. u.s. patent 3,516,957 teaches poly(alkylene terephthalates) with "a small percentage of an ester of an organic acid having from 10 to 27 carbon atoms and an alcohol having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, e.g., methyl stearate or pentaerythritol tetrastearate, with the "cojoint presence of a synergistic agent such as an alkali metal salt or alkaline earth metal salt of an organic acid having 10 to 25 carbon atoms, e.g., sodium stearate; talc, and asbestos". the flory interaction parameter for pentaerithritol tetrastearate is 0.42, and for methyl stearate is 0.48. we have now found a process and composition which can be used to enable polyesters such as pet to be molded at mold temperatures below 100 c to obtain highly crystalline parts even in thin sections the crystallization rate of the polyester being enhanced in the composition to enable this. the composition aspect of the invention can further provide polyester molding compositions which do not need to contain highly volatile solvents which tend to migrate to the surface of moldings. the compositions of the invention comprise (i) thermoplastic polyester of aliphatic diol and dicarboxylic acid, at least 95 mole % of said acid being terephthalic acid, (ii) inert particulate nucleating agent, and (iii) oligomeric polyester as crystallization promoter, said oligomeric polyester being of organic dicarboxylic acid having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and organic
