<ABSTRACT>
a portable manually operated tool for applying multi-contact  connectors to flexible flat cable includes a pair of  pivoted jaws which include respective connector body and  cover holding members.  the jaws are opened and closed  by manually actuated handles including a locking toggle  mechanism.  the connector holding members include co-operating  alignment guides and position stops.  one of the  connector holding members is mounted for limited movement  on one of the jaws to provide for engagement of the  alignment guides and to provide even distribution of the  clamping force on the connector.  the tool also includes a  retractable cable cutter and positioning stop as well as a  cable alignment and support tray.
