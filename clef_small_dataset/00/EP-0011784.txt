<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to finely divided, sedimentation-stable dispersions of solid aromatic isocyanatosulfonic acid in organic polyisocyanates, in which, based on the total number of equivalents of isocyanate groups, a total of 5-60 equivalent% of free and dimerized isocyanate groups of aromatic polyisocyanatosulfone acids are present, as well as a process for producing of these dispersions by a) sulfonation of aromatic polyisocyanates with sulfur trioxide in the presence of hydrophobic, in isocyanate at least at elevated temperature-soluble, polar groups having organic substances, b) sulfonation of aromatic polyisocyanates in the presence of the auxiliaries mentioned under a), as well as in the presence of an inert low Silescent organic solution with TELS subsequent distillative removal of this solvent, or by c) cuzine heating to a maximum of 150 Â° C or milling unstable coarse suspensions of aromatic IS Ocyanatosulfonic acid uretdions in polyisocyanates or inert solvents in the presence of auxiliaries mentioned under A), where appropriate, where appropriate, co-applied organic solvent is removed by distillation and wherein in the case of the use of coarseu spenses, which contain no non-sulfonated polyisocy, the continuous phase forming Organic polyisocyanate is added before the distillative removal of the solvent.
