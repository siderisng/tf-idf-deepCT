<ABSTRACT>
In methods for obtaining chlorine oxygen acids or their salts by electrolysis of seawater or unruly metal ion-containing salt solutions, difficulties occur due to magnifying deposits. For the purpose of avoiding the approach formation, in a derar method, the electrolytic cell is operated as long with uninniguous seawater or uncleaned salt solution, up to the electrodes a layer of compounds of the vernunizing metal ions, in particular calcium carbonate and / or magnesium hydroxide, in a sufficient and a current efficiency of is deposited more than 90%, and then the calcium and / or magnesium ions contained in the uninucleated salt water or in the uncleaned saline solution are by the addition of sodium hydroxide and / or calcium hydroxide and sodium carbonate at a pH of over 9 completely or Partly precipitated, the precipitation products optionally separated and the purified solution of the electrolysis cell fed.
