<ABSTRACT>
Peristaltic pump for pumping a dialysate solution through a dialysate solution circuit in a hemodialysis system. The pump comprises four rollers attached to a rotatable base, wherein a relatively long portion of the circuit tube is guided under voltage thus around the pump head that it is enclosed and compressed by at least two of the rollers. The fastening of the rollers allows longitudinal movement of the pressure points of the hose during the revolution of the pump head, whereby the dialysis solution is guided in the circulation. The proposed pump enables a substantially uniform flow rate when the negative pressure changes in the dialysis solution. It can be used in a one-piece, portable hemodialyser with proportionation device for unique flow or with batchwise supply of the dialysis solution. In the proposed proportioning device, soluble gases are removed in a circulating vent system from the water used for the dialysis solution. The peristaltic pump for the dialysate solution is thus attached to the portable hemodialysis device such that rapid switching of unique flow on batchwise supply of the solution and vice versa is easily possible.
