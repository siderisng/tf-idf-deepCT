<ABSTRACT>
the process comprises contacting a hydrocarbon feeds­ tock containing a substantial amount of organic nitrogen-­ containing compounds in a first reaction zone (18) under hyd­ rocracking conditions and in the presence of hydrogen with a  first catalyst comprising nickel and molybdenum or nickel and  tungsten, their oxides, and/or their sulfides on a co-catalytic  acidic cracking support comprising ultrastable, large-pore  crystalline aluminosilicate material and a silica-alumina mat­ rix to produce a first hydrocracked effluent and contacting  said first hydrocracked effluent in a second reaction zone (19)  under hydrocracking conditions acid in the presence of hyd­ rogen with a second catalyst comprising cobalt and molyb­ denum, their oxides, and/or their sulfides on a co-catalytic  acidic cracking support comprising ultrastable, large-pore  crystalline aluminosilicate material and a silica-alumina mat­ rix to produce a second hydrocracked effluent (23).  preferably,  the first catalyst comprises nickel and tungsten deposed on  the co-catalytic acidic cracking support.  in one embodiment of the process, the second catalyst is  a catalyst that has been deactivated and then regenerated  prior to its use in the process.
