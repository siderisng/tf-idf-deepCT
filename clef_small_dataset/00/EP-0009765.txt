<ABSTRACT>
a process is provided in which partially oriented synthe­ tic yarn such as partially oriented polyester yarn is fed con­ tinuously first to and through a bath 7 of a liquid conditioning  agent such as a dye, then to a first heated roll 9 and then to a  second heated draw roll 10 to draw the partially oriented  yarn, then to a texturizer 12 and then to a takeup roll 14, all in  one continuous operation, to produce a conditioned and tex­ turized yarn product possessing about 12% to about 30%  latent shrinkage.  also provided is a novel process for dyeing  undrawn, partially drawn or fully drawn synthetic yarn.

<DESCRIPTION>
process of dyeing of synthetic polymeric thermoplastic yarns and product produced by the process the invention concerns the continuous conditioning and textur zing of synthetic yarns to produce a product possessing substantial latent shrinkage. by "conditioning" the yarn, as used herein, means applying various liquid conditioners to the yarn such as dyes, fire retardants, optical brighteners, soil release agents, bonding agt, lubricants, antioxidants, delusterants, and antistatic agents. u.s. patent 3,434,189 (buck et al.) discloses a method of conti nuously.dyeing and stretching undrawn yarn. the patent discs the well known process of making synthetic yarn from thermoplas i; polymers by first extruding continuous filaments, drawing the extruded filaments to orient the molecules in the filament and to improve the tensile strength, and then dyeing and texturizir. the yarn, the latter step accomplished, for example1 by stuffc box or false twist crimping. the patent discloses and claims a process for continuously applying dye to "undrawn yarn" followed by drawing and texturizing the dyed yarn. as used in u.s. patent 3,434,189,the term 11undrawn yarn" refers to yarn produced by conventional thermoplastic filament extruders. the specification states that, in some instances, the "undrawn yarn" may in fact be slightly drawn after extrusion and before being applied to the drawing and texturizing apparatus. however, even though "slightly" drawn to provide a small degree of orientation of yarn filament molecules, this slightly drawn yarn is generally referred to in the art as "undrawn yarn. the patent states that before such yarns can be supplied to texturizing apparatus and later made up into finished garments, it is necessary to draw the yarn and extend its length by at least two times. thus, the meaning of the term "undrawn yarn",by implication, includes yarn with a small degree of orientation of its molecules which yarn has been drawn to a degree considerably less than two times. the specification and all claims of u.s. patent 3,434,189 are limited by express language to "undrawn yarn". nowhere in the reference is a product disclosed having substantial latent shrinkage. u.s. patent 3,751,778 (grosjean et al.) discloses a process for the simultaneous texturizing and dyeing or finishing of synthetic thermoplastic yarns. the process comprises packing and compressing the yarns into a confined space through introduction of a flow of a compressed fluid heated to a temperature sufficient to set the yarns, allowing a portion of the compressed fluid to provide movement of the yarns axially in the confined space with the remainder of the fluid escaping laterally from the confined space into a further annular space under a pressure lower than the pressure of the first confined space but higher than atmospheric pressure, and simultaneously intro- ducing a dyeing solution or finishing agent into the confined space and over the compressed yarns. this process is characterized in that the compressed yarn is continuously passed through at least one expansion zone and then through at least one expansion zone and then through at least one zone in which an additional fluid is introduced under pressure.

<CLAIMS>
 claims 1. the process of dyeing of synthetic polymeric thermopla  stic yarns c h   a r    a c t e r i z e d in that the  dye used in said process is a sublimatable ink.   2. the process of claim 1 for producing, in a continuous  operation, conditioned and textured synthetic polymeric  yarn, comprising:  a) continuously feeding at least one end of synthetic  thermoplastic feed yarn to and through a bath of a li  quid conditioning agent,  b) wiping excess conditioning agent from said yarn,  c) drawing said yarn,  d) feeding said conditioned and drawn yarn to a textu  rizer, and  e) accumulating said conditioned and texturized yarn on  a take-up device, characterized in that said synthetic  thermoplastic feed yarn is partially oriented yarn,  said liquid conditioning agent is a sublimatable ink,  and, after the wiping step, said yarn is directed to and  around a first rotating, heated predraw roller (9) and  thence to and around a second rotating,  heated draw  roller (10) rotating at a faster peripheral speed than  said first roller to impart draw to said yarn, the pro  duct obtained thereby possessing latent shrinkage in the  range of about 12% to about   30%    3. the process of claim 2 in which a multiplicity of feed  yarn ends (3, 4) are processed.      a.    the process of claim 2- in which the said partially  oriented synthetic thermoplastic feed yarn is selected  from the class consisting of polyesters, polyamides,    cellulose acetates, polyvinyl chlorides and polypro  pylenes.   5. the process of claim 4 in which said partially oriented  synthetic thermoplastic feed yarn is a polyester yarn  and said conditioning agent is a sublimatable dye.    6. the process of claim 2 wherein at least one feed yarn  end (3a) is white and is not dyed during passage through  said process and wherein at least one other yarn end  (4a) is dyed to a desired color, to produce a product  yarn bundle having a white/color heather effect.   7. the process of claim 2 wherein at least one feed yarn  end (3b) is dyed one color during passage through said  process and at least one other yarn end (4b) is dyed  another color during passage through said process to  produce a product yarn bundle having a color/color hea  ther effect.    8. the process of claim 2 in which said conditioning agent  is a dye and is applied intermittently along the length  of said yarn to produce a space dyed effect.    9. the product produced by the process of claim 1.   10. the product produced by the process of claim 2.
