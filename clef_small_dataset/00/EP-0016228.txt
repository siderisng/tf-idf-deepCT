<ABSTRACT>
to improve the thermal resistance, thermal shock resis­ tance and vibration-proof property, a controlling unit of a  charging generator controller is, in the form of a package,  separated from the generator and the output unit of the charg­ ing generator controller, which output unit is hermetically  sealed in a metal case.  in addition, the control unit is arranged  so as not to be affected by heat generated from an engine,  charging generator and the controller itself whereby tempera­ ture correction may be made with accuracy.  this is thus  adapted for the controllers in case of charging an automotive  battery for a vehicle or the like by a charging generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
charging generator control device field of the art this invention relates to a charging generator control device for charging a battery with the output voltage from a charging generator. background of the invention in general, in a charging generator or "alternator", an ac generator unit, a full-wave rectifier and three-phase auxiliary diode are provided along with a charging generator control device adapted to maintain the output voltage of the ac generator unit at a predetermined value. the control device may be mounted either inside or outside of the charging generator unit with the control and output sections of the control device being integral with one another. furthermore, in the charging generator control device, the resistors, semiconductive devices, and capacitors used therein are in general sealed individually or are constructed in the form of an integrated circuit encased in metal or resin and surrounded by a flexible resin material such as silicone, epoxy or urethane resin. a charging generator control device using a resin case can be manufactured at relatively low cost. however, its heat resistance and thermal-shock resistance characteristics are inferior to those of a charging generator control device whose components are sealed such as by welding or brazing in a metal case. furthermore, it may be desired to mount a charging generator control device whose control section and output section form a single unit separate from a charging generator installed on the engine, specifically to mount the control dev-ice on a part of the vehicle body which is substantially equal in temperature to the battery so that the charging characteristics are torrected in accordancewith' 'the temperature of the battery by providing a negative temperature gradient for the control value. in such a case, the field current varies with the load of the charging generator thereby changing the temperature of the charging generator control device making it difficult to perform accurate temperature correction in accordance with the temperature of the battery. disclosure of the invention in accordance with this invention, the output section and the control section in the charging generator control device are provided as two separate package units with only the control section sealed in a molded or metal case which is positioned remote from the charging generator. a surge absorbing diode, power transistors or the like employed in the output section are sealed in a metal case so that the heat resistance and thermal-shock resistance characteristics thereof are improved so as to be substantially equivalent to those of a full-wave rectifier enclosed in a metal case which has been found to operate satisfactorily. furthermore, as only the control section is mounted on a part of the vehicle body which is substantially equal in temperature to the battery, no heat is generated therein. thus, the charging generator control device according to the invention is advantageous in that it can be manufactured at relatively low cost and can perform temperature correction of the charging characteristics accurately in response to the ambient temperature. brief description of the drawings fig. 1
