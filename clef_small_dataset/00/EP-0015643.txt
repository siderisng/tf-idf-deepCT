<ABSTRACT>
a fluid coupling device is disclosed of the type includ­ ing an output coupling assembly (13) which defines a  fluid operating chamber (37) and a fluid reservoir cham­ ber (41).  rotatably disposed within the operating chamber  is an input coupling member (11), including a disc-like  portion (31), which defines rearward lands (61) and for­ ward lands (65).  the lands defined by the input coupling  member cooperate with the lands (63 and 67) defined by  the output coupling assembly to define rearward and for­ ward shear spaces, operable to transmit torque from the  input member to the output assembly.  the disc-like portion  defines a plurality of fluid passages (71) which communi­ cate between the inner and outer radial peripheries of the  disc-like portion, and also communicate with both the for­ ward and rearward shear spaces.  during filling, fluid flows  radially outward through the fluid passages, and directly  into the shear spaces, to substantially reduce the response  time of the coupling device.
