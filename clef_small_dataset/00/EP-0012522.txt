<ABSTRACT>
a pair of switches 10a and 10b are disposed adjacent  one another in a housing 11 which contains the highly in足 sulating gas sulphur hexafluoride.  in a closed position of  each switch, a pivotable contact arm 15 engages fixed con足 tact fingers 21 to permit the flow of load current there足 through.  on opening of each switch, the contact arm 15  pivots away from the fingers 21 so that an arc is drawn  therebetween, the arc subsequently being transferred from  the fingers 21 to a tubular electrode 26.  the arc current  then flows through a field coil 22 connected in series with  the electrode 26, such that a magnetic field is generated  which causes the arc to rotate and become extinguished.   the electrode 26 and field coil 22 are common to both  switches 10a and 10b, the contact arms 15 of the latter  being disposed respectively at opposite ends of the coil 22  and being isolated from each other by a transverse insula足 ting member 29 disposed centrally in the electrode 26.  the  coil 22 is spirally wound so as to be symmetrical about a  transverse plane through its centre, and therefore provides  the same operating characteristics for each of the two  switches 10a and 10b.
