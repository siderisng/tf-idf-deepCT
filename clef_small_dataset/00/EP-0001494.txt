<ABSTRACT>
the dielectric of a high-voltage cable is of lapped  tapes that comprise alkene polymer film (13) preferably  laminated between two paper layers (14).  the dielectric is  impregnated with an insulating liquid that is a aryl alkane  having two or more separate benzene rings and 1-6 aliphatic  non-cyclic carbon atoms per benzene ring.  the  benzene rings (or two of them if there are more than two  in the molecule) are separated by no more than two aliphatic  carbon atoms.  some of the aliphatic carbon atoms  may be in hydrocarbon substituents in the benzene rings.
