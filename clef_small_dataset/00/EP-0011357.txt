<ABSTRACT>
u-shaped metal channel members (8,9) are used to  attach cladding boards (4,5,6) to flanged structural steelwork  (3), the flanges (13,14) of the latter being received in the  channels and retained there by the boards, which are fasÂ­ tened to the channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
storing heat at a steady temperature (claims in different categories) this invention relates to a way of storing heat at a steady (including a nearly steady) temperature. water is a popular medium for storing heat (for example for central heating systems) but, while it remains a liquid, its temperature varies according to the heat energy stored in it. this is inconvenient for those systems which rely on a steadytemperature reservoir to or from which heat is transferred. british patent no. 1396293 suggests that the steadytemperature reservoir may be a freezable fluid such as water. heat can be stored in/withdrawn from-this reservoir as latent heat of fusion/freezing, without affecting the temperature of the reservoir. however, the water/ice transformation occurs at too low a temperature for many purposes, and british patent no. 1396292 suggests the use of crystallisable hydrates (such as trisodium orthophosphate dodecahydrate). because this hydrate at its 'melting' temperature does not all dissolve in its own water of crystallisation, water must in practice be added to obtain a clear solution. as a result of the added water, the hydrate crystallises over a temperature range, which is undesirable, 0 and moreover melts at about 75 c, too high for many purposes. experiments with salts showing a sharp crystallisation temperature have shown that supercooling is often a problem, and that to prevent this by adding seed particles of a foreign substance is often effective for only a limited number of melting/ freezing cycles. this invention is the use of a collocation of calcium chloride hexahydrate and up to 20 per cent strontium chloride hexahydrate to store heat at a steady temperature (about 290c). this invention also consists in a heat storage device containing, as the heat storage medium, a collocation of calcium chloride hexahydrate and up to 20 per cent strontium chloride hexahydrate, or a precursor or precursors of this medium, the device having means to seal the medium from water vapour; the device may further have means for putting the medium into thermal communication selectively with a heat source and a heat sink. the amount of water present in the medium (or precursorts)) may deviate by up to 20% either way of the exact amount necessary for the hexahydrates. calcium chloride hexahydrate 'melts' at about 0 29 c and the whole of the calcium chloride dissolves in the water of crystallisation released, leaving a clear solution (congruent melting). this avoids a disadvantageous layering effect and the need for thickening of the solution. the melted solution is preferably saturated in strontium chloride, especially at immediately above the said steady temperature, with some strontium chloride hexahydrate left over as solid. the proportion of strontium chloride hexahydrate by weight thus is preferably at least 0.1%, more preferably at least 0.4, usefully at least 0.9in, and may be up to iso%, preferably up to 5, more preferably up to 2%, most preferably up to 12%. the best proportion may be dependent on the shape of the container for the heat storage medium, and on whether

 claims   1. the use of a collocation of calcium chloride hexahydrate and up to 20 percent strontium chloride hexahydrate to store heat at a steady temperature.   2. the use of claim 1, wherein the collocation contains more than sufficient strontium chloride hexahydrate to saturate the (liquified) calcium chloride hexahydrate immediately above the said steady temperature.   3. the use of claim 2, wherein the collocation contains at least 0.1% strontium chloride hexahydrate.   4. the use of claim 3, wherein the collocation contains at least   0.4%    strontium chloride hexahydrate.    5. the use of claim 4, wherein the collocation contains at least 0.9% strontium chloride hexahydrate.   6. the use of any preceding claim, wherein the collocation contains up to 10% strontium chloride hexahydrate.   7. the use of claim 6, wherein the collocation contains up to 2% strontium chloride hexahydrate.   8. a heat storage device containing, as the heat storage medium, the collocation defined in any one of claims 1 to 7, the device further comprising the means to seal the medium from water vapour.   9. the heat storage device of claim 8, further comprising means for putting the medium into thermal communication selectively with a heat source and a heat sink.     10. the heat storage device of claim 8 or 9, wherein the strontium chloride hexahydrate is present in finely divided form.
