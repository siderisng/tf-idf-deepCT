<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus (10) is disclosed having a generally  u-shaped horizontal top rail (12) delineating the front (14)  and two sides (16, 18) of the apparatus (10), the rear (20)  of the apparatus (10) being open.  four legs (22, 24, 26,  28) depend from the top rail (12) in the general form of  a cubic trapezoid delineating the four upright edges of  the apparatus (10).  a seat (30) is pivotally mounted to a  first (22) of the four legs and is lockingly engageable with  the second (24) of the four legs thereby closing the rear  (20) of the apparatus (10).  a knee pad (32) is located bet­ ween the third (26) and fourth (28) legs and situated with  respect to the seat (30) so as to permit the user of the  apparatus (10) to assume a standing or a semi-sitting po­ sition.  the apparatus (10) may comprise wheels and bra­ ke means engageable with said wheels.
