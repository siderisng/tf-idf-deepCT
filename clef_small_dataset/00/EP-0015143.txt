<ABSTRACT>
pieces of fabric 30 are treated with ozone-steam mixtures  by conveying them by means of a conveyor 19 through an  open-ended chamber 10 having a horizontal middle section  10a substantially elevated with respect to the open chamber  ends 10b and to which ozone and steam are centrally intro­ duced through inlets 11, 12.  the elevation of the middle sec­ tion 10a is found to confine the ozone and steam to this  section with little loss at the ends.  the apparatus includes  circulating fans 13, tubes 15 for withdrawal of gaseous mix­ ture for analysis and also an outlet tube 23 for condensed  water.
