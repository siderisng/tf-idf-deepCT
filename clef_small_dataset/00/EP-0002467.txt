<ABSTRACT>
an interexchange signalling system is described, basically  operating the exchange of information making use of the  language characteristics of logic units.  it comprises: a plurality  of line units (ul1, ul2 . . .  uln), mainly consisting of  sensors and actuators; an input-output unit (iu), able to scan  the line units and to meter criteria durations; a processing  unit (el), able to control and recognize signalling criteria; a  transmission interface (it), able to effectuate series-to-parallel  and parallel-to-series conversions, to effectuate level  transitions as well as filtering operations and to memorize  arriving and outgoing messages till the time slot allotted to  their processing and sending to the remote station, is  present.  speech and data bidirectional connections are  foreseen between said units, as well as quick connections for  the direct transit of the signals from line units to the  interconnection line.
