bicyclic s-lactam antibacterial agents, their use in pharmaceutical compositions, processes for their preparation and intermediates for use in such processes r. b. woodward (acta pharm. suecica 1977, 14 suppl., p 23 - 25) disclosed that the compounds of the formula (i): emi1.1 where r was an unspecified group possessed antibacterial activity. no aid in determining the nature of the group r was given by professor woodward nor did he describe the preparation of any compounds of the formula (i). however, at the symposium on current topics in drug research (uppsala, sweden october 1977) professor woodward described the compound of the formula (i) wherein r is a hydrogen atom. we have prepared this compound and found it to possess a somewhat disappointing degree of antibacterial activity. clearly it would be desirable to find a class of compounds that possess a better degree of activity especially against gram positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus pyogenes. such a class of compounds has now been found. accordingly the present invention provides the compounds of the formula (ii): emi2.1 and salts and cleavable esters thereof wherein r1 is a oh, or2, ocor3, o.co.or4, o.s02r5, n3 or nh2 group wherein r2 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group or an aralkyl group; r3 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, an aryl group or an aralkyl group; r4 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, an aryl group or an aralkyl group; and r5 is a lower alkyl group, or a tolyl group. when used herein the term "lower alkyl" means an alkyl group of 1 - 4 carbon atoms such as the methyl and ethyl groups, when used herein the term "aryl" means a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by a halogen atom or an alkoxyl group of 1 or 2 carbon atoms. when used herein the term "lower aralkyl" means a lower alkyl group substituted by an aryl group. when used herein the term "substituted lower alkyl" means a lower alkyl group substituted by a methoxyl, ethoxyl, acetoxyl, amino, acetamido, benzyloxycarbonylamino, benzyloxycarbonyloxy or hydroxyl group of which the amino and hydroxyl groups must not be attached to the carbon atom. very favourably r1 is a hydroxyl group as @@@ resulting compound of the formula (111): emi3.1 and its salts and cleavable esters serve as intermediates as well as biologically active substances. preferably r1 is amino as the resulting compounds have particularly good antibacterial properities, for example against pseudomonas. suitable values for r2 include the methyl, ethyl, benzyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-aminoethyl, 2-acetor=methyl 2-methoxyethyl, acetoxymethyl, methoxymethyl, -and meth@ne sulchonyl croups. suitable values for r3 and r4 include those listed as suitable for r2 and the phenyl group. suitable values for r include the methyl 5 and p-tolyl groups. such compounds are intended primarily as intermediates, for example in the preparation of the compounds in which r1 is n3. the azide is also envisaged primarily as an intermediate in the preparation of the

what we claim is:   1. a compound of the formula   (ii):    emi60.1        or a salt or cleavable ester thereof wherein r1 is a  oh, or2, ocor3,   o.co.or4,    o.s02r5, n3 or nh2 group  wherein r2 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted  lower alkyl group'or an aralkyl group; r3 is a  lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl  group, an aryl group or an aralkyl group;   r4    is a  lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group,  an aryl group or an aralkyl group; and r5 is a  lower alkyl group, or a tolyl group.   2. a compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein   r     is oh.   3. a compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein r1 is  or2 where r2 is a methyl, ethyl, benzyl, 2  hydroxyethyl, 2-aminoethyl, 2-acetoxyethyl,  2-methoxyethyl, acetoxymethyl, methoxymethyl or  methane sulphonyl group.   4. a compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein r1 is a  n3 group.   5. a compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein r1 is a  nh2 group.     6. a compound of the formula (ii) as claimed in any  of claims 1 to 5 in the form of a pharmaceutically  acceptable salt.   7. a compound of the formula (ii) as claimed in any  of claims 1 to 5 in the form of a cleavable ester  wherein the ester moiety is of the part formulae  (a) or (b):  - co-o-cha1-o-co-a2 (a) emi61.1        where a1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group,  a2 is an alkyl or alkoxyl group of 1 - 4 carbon  atoms or a phenyl group, a3 is a hydrogen atom or  a methyl or methoxyl group and a4 is a hydrogen atom  or a methyl or methoxyl group.   8. a compound of the formula (ii) as claimed in any  of claims 1 to 5 in the form of a benzyl or p  nitrobenzyl ester.   9. a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound  as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7 and a pharma  ceutically acceptable carrier therefor.      10. a process for the preparation of a compound of the  formula (ii) or a salt or cleavable ester thereof  as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9 which comprises  the ring closure with elimination of the elements  of triphenylphosphineoxide from a cleavable ester  of the compound of the formula (iv): emi62.1       in which the hydroxyl group is optionally protected and thereafter removing the optional protecting group and (a) cleaving the ester to yield a compound of the formula   (iii)    or a salt thereof or (b) converting-the hydroxyl group into a   or2,    ocor3, ocoor4. os02r5, n3 or nh2 group and if desired cleaving the ester of the resulting compound of the formula (ii) to yield the compound of the formula (11) or a salt thereof.
