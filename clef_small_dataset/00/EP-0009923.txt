<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a device for the removal of foul  air from toilet bowls or the like.  the device (10) comprises a  conduit (12) having an inlet opening (14) and at least one  outlet opening (16) spaced from the inlet opening.  the conÂ­ duit (12) has a hook shape (12. 1) and is capable of hooking  over the rim (18) of the toilet bowl (20) and under the seat (22)  so that the inlet opening (14) is within the bowl (20) and the  outlet opening (16) is outside the bowl (20).  the device (10)  also includes an air treatment means (26) within the conduit  (12), capable of improving the quality of foul air passing  through it.  the device (10) also includes a battery-operable  fan (28) capable of drawing foul air out of the bowl (20) via the  inlet opening (14), along the conduit (12), through the air  treatment means (26) and out of the outlet opening (16).  the  air treatment means (26), optionally together with the battery  (30), may be provided as a replaceable pack.  a securing  means, e. g.  in the form of a strap, may pass through the  device and be of a length to fit around the bowl.  a lock can be  provided on the strap.  a resilient seal (42) may be supplied for  attachment to the underside of the seat (22).
