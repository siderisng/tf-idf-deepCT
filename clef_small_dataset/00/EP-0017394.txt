<ABSTRACT>
a container for containment of bituminous products  formed by inner (10) and outer (11) flexible casings in  intimate contact.  the inner casing (10) is of a material which  has a softening temperature which is above that of the  bituminous product (b) when loaded into the container but  below that of the bituminous product (b) when it is applied in  use, usually by spraying.  this inner casing (10) is of a  material which has a viscosity at the application temperature  which enables the material when melted with the bituminous  product to be applied therewith.  the outer casing (11) is made from a material which has  strength characteristics which enable it to contain the inner  casing (10) and bituminous product (b) during the filling of  the container as well as during transportation and storage  thereof.  the outer casing (11) is impervious to movement  therethrough of the contained bituminous product, compoÂ­ nents or additives thereof and preferably has a softening  temperature such that melting does not occur at the  application temperature.
