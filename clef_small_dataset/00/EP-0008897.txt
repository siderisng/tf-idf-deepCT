<ABSTRACT>
a constant-voltage power source device for a highly  accurate electric circuit, connected to an a. c.  power source,  capable of minimizing size of the current loop, making the  ground line current constant even when the load current var­ ies, and having a high noise elimination ratio as well as a low  output impedance.  the device comprises a constant-current circuit (28)  connected in series with the load (26), and in parallel there­ with a constant-voltage circuit (30) including a control amp­ lifier (44) which controls the current (ic - io) flowing there­ through so that sum of this current and the output current (io)  of the dovice supplied to the load (26) equals to the output  current (ic) of the constant-current circuit (28).  the device is particularly suitable for an audio/video  recording/reproducing apparatus or a measuring instru­ ment, and can be used instead of a battery power source  which, until now, has been considered to be ideal for such  purposes.
