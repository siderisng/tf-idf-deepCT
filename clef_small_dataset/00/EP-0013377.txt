In order to keep the spring travel of a screwed on the ring (22) of the plunger (20) screwing pressure spring (24) and the pressure required to open the valve, the hub (26) has a zen trelle recess (34) of circular cross-section which conically extends towards the valve disk (14), and the valve plate (14) consisting of an unelastic material carries a rod (36) extending from him into the outlets (34), within the hub (26 ) Lying portion (44) from the lowest diameter of the recess (34) at most equal diameter on and carries the head (38) which engages behind the hub (26) on its front side (42) facing away from the valve disk (14).
