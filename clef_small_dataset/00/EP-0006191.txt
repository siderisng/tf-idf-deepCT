<ABSTRACT>
For a hand welder for thermoplastic and lacing bands with a clamping device for holding the beginning of the band (2), a clamping roller (7) liftable from a fixed tension bed (6) and a rotatable and clamping bed (6) lifting roller (7), a plate-shaped between the overlapping Tape ends temporarily retractable heating element (8), a press punch (9) for pressing the heated tape ends and with a cutting device (11, 12) for cutting out a coating tape (1) from a storage roller are for actuating the clamping device, the clamping device, the cutting device, of the press punch and the heating element hand lever provided. For operation simplification of the manual welding device for opening the clamping device (3, 4) and for opening the clamping device (6, 7) a vibrating lever (15) pivotable against the action of at least one spring (5, 18), and a via a freewhole coupling ( 47) With the clamped roller (7) coupled actuating lever (14) is via a towing coupling (44, 45, 46) with the heating element (8), the cutting device (11, 12) and the press punch (9) dome bar, wherein the Cutting off and combining the overlapping ends by moving the operating lever (14) in freewheeling.
