<ABSTRACT>
a push-in pressure releasing resealable closure for an  aperture in a sheet metal container member is disclosed,  wherein the closure is integral through a connection of metal  to the remainder of the container member.  the closure is  designed so that it is depressible into the container by flexing  about the connection when push-in force is applied to the  closure, without exceeding the elastic limit of the connection,  so that the closure is returned at least substantially to its  original position to seal the can contents, upon removal of  the push-in force from the closure.  the closure is particularly suitable for use in containers  for carbonated beverages, such as carbonated soft drinks  and beer, so that the gas pressure within the container may  be released without danger of substantial gushing or spurting,  to permit a larger pouring opening in the container  member to be opened.  the specification discloses several embodiments of the  pressure releasing closure including one in which the closure  is formed partly within a pouring closure and partly outside  said pouring closure whereby the pressure releasing closure  is permanently opened by the opening of said pouring closure  to create an air vent or liquid draining opening outside  the pouring closure.  the specification also discloses methods of forming  closures in which the number of forming stages is reduced.   in one method, the closure piercing operating is performed  at the same time as the edge of the tab is downwardly  reformed.  in another method, the sheet metal around the  opening is also reformed in the same operation.
