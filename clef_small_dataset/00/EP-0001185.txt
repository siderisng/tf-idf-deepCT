<ABSTRACT>
a wholly aromatic polyester is provided which unlike the  aromatic polyesters normally encountered in the prior art is  not intractable or difficulty tractable and readily undergoes  melt processing with ease.  the aromatic polyester of the  present invention consists essentially of the recurring units (a)  p-oxybenzoyl moiety, (b)m-oxybenzoyl moiety, (c) 2,6-dicarboxynaphthalene moiety, and (d) symmetrical dioxy aryl  moiety (as defined), and is free of units which possess ring  substitution.  the resulting polyester exhibits a melting point  below approximately 310°c, and preferably below 300°c.  the  ability of the wholly aromatic polyester readily to undergo  melt processing can be attributed to its atypical inherent  propensity to form a thermotropic melt phase at relatively low  temperatures.  the wholly aromatic polyester may be formed  by a variety of procedures including a slurry polymerization  technique (as defined) or a melt polymerization technique.   the presence of the meta-oxybenzoyl moiety in the wholly  aromatic polyester (as described) has been found to render  the polymer melt processable at even lower temperatures  than if this component were omitted.
