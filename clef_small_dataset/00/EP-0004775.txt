<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a microprocessor designed specifically for use in a homogeneous computing system.  the microprocessor has a memory (20), a main processing unit (30) for performing arithmetic and logic operations, and a plurality of communication processors (p0 to p11) controlling the communication between the different microprocessors in a system.  the communication processors (p0 to p11) are controlled by programmes so that a set of communication processors (p4 to p11) can selectively be controlled to provide either a plurality of serial inputs/outputs or the communication processors (p4 to p11) of the set collectively to provide a parallel interface.
