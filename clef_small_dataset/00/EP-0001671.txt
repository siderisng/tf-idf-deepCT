<ABSTRACT>
a passive dosing dispenser for issuing, for example a  predetermined volume of a toilet tank additive solution into a  toilet tank as the water is draining therefrom while the toilet is  flushing.  a preferred dispenser comprises a reservoir for containing  a quantity of a toilet tank additive type product and in  which reservoir a solid type product can be dissolved to form  a product solution.  in operation, while the water in the toilet  tank is receding from about the dispenser, a predetermined  dose-volume of toilet tank water is vacuum-transferred into  the reservoir through an inlet conduit, and a substantially  equal dose-volume of the product solution is dispensed  through a discharge standpipe.  the dispenser may further  comprise an internal baffle to precipitate mixing and agitation  inside the dispenser which promote dissolution.  the dispenser  also provides an air-lock when immersed in a full toilet  tank which air-lock isolates the product and product solution  from toilet tank water which surrounds the dispenser during  quiescent periods.  in a particularly preferred embodiment, a  dispenser which further isolates the solid type product from  the product solution during quiescent periods is provided.   plural product co-dispensers which embody the present  invention are also disclosed.
