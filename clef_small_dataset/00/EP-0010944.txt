<ABSTRACT>
a load carrying platform (10) having a pair of end  walls (13) movable between an upright and a collapsed  condition.  each end wall (13) includes a pair of corner  posts which are individually pivoted to pivots provided  between rigid plates mounted at the corners of the platÂ­ form.  the base of the corner post (15) is l-shaped, the  pivot being received in an arm of the l-shape and being  spaced from the end of the platform (10) so that rotation  of the corner post (15) displaces it from its position  between the plates.  a cam locking bar is inserted through  generally aligned openings in the post (15) and plates.  the  end walls (13) are resiliently biased upright by means  which may comprise a torsion bar or a rotatable bar  biased against rotation by spring means.
