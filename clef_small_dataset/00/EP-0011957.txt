<ABSTRACT>
a bearing tube construction in which the tube (10) has a  series of inwardly depressed lugs (17) spaced apart peripherÂ­ ally around the tube to define a series of shoulders (16) at the  inner end of the housing to limit inward movement of the  outer race of the bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
"bearing tubes" this invention relates to certain improvements in bearing tube construction such as axle tubes or wheel bearings. in the axles of automotive wsh,cles the rear axle usually has a differential housing at the centre from which project outwardly a pair of axle tubes which at their outer ends support the rear wheel bearings. the bearings carry both the ioad and thrust and the ends of the axle tubes therefore are specially constructed to take these bearings both in load and thrust, and further the axle tubes have on them a flange which is adapted to engage a bearing retainer when the bearing is in position. the usual practice at the present time is to weld to the end of the axle housing a member which is machined out neatly to take the bearing and has on it a peripheral flange to which a retainer for the bearing is bolted, the member which is welded to the end of the axle tubes being of substantial constructtion and usually being a forging which because of its method of construction has a substantial radius when the blankh:is forged and therefore requires considerable machining to provide the seating recess for the bearing. the reason this construction is used is to ensure that the bearing can take the necessary inward thrust on its outer race, the outward thrust being taken by the bearing retaining member. it is also known to thicken and shape the end of the axle tubes by heating and working the axle tubes to produce the required thickness which will then allow a sufficient bearing recess to be machined to support the bearing against inward thrust while still providing the strength necessary to carry the required load. however, this method requires considerable work and, because it is necessary to heat the axle tubes, scale formation occurs with the subsequent necessity of removal of such scale. because it is the practice to use standard axle tubes and standard differential fittings, the end of the tube sometimes requires reducing in diameter, and it is known to have the bearing supporting forging fitted over a reduced end of the axle tube and then welded rigidly to the axle tube so that when the bearing recess is machined the end of the axle tube forms the inner thrust member for the outer race of the bearing, and in same cases the outer end portion of the axle tube is thickened inwards only to provide the necessary flange when the bearing socket is machined to take the inward thrust of the bearing, but whatever method has been used heretofore it is generally necessary either to use a separate forged member welded to the end of the axle tube or to thicken the end of the axle tube by heat treatment and compression to have sufficient material to achieve the necessary thrust member at the inner end of the bearing recess. it is known to form axle tubes in two press-metal halves and to weld these

 claims   1. a bearing tube construction comprising a tube, a bearing housing at least one end portion of said tube, characterised by a series of inwardly depressed lugs spaced apart peripherally around the said tube to define a series of shoulders at the inner end of the said bearing housing to limit inward movement of a bearing.   2. a bearing tube construction according to claim 1 characterised in that the portions of the said tube between the said lugs generally maintain the normal tubular form, and a flange is secured to or integral with said tube to project outwardly therefrom.   3. a bearing tube construction comprising a tube characterised in that there is a bearing housing at each end portion of said tube, and a series of inwardly displaced depressed lugs spaced apart peripherally around the said tube to define a series of shoulders at the inner end of each said bearing housing to limit inward axial movement of the bearings in said housings, the portions of the said tube between said lugs generally maintaining the normal tubular form, and a flange secured to the said tube to project outwardly therefrom.   4. a bearing tube according to claims 1, 2 or 3 characterised in that the said depressed lugs increase in depth outwardly toward the said bearing housing or housings to form the said shoulders in the said tube.        5      !    a bearing tube according to claims   x,    2 or    3    characterised in that the inside surface of the tube where it forms the bearing housing or housings    -arz    the outwardly facing shoulders of the depressions are machined to engage respectively the outer periphery and the inner face, of an outer race of the   barring    in the latter case, to limit inward axial movement of the said bearing.   6. a bearing tube construction comprising a tube, a bearing housing formed at at least one end portion of said tube, characterised by a series of inwardly displaced depressed lugs spaced apart peripherally around the said tube to form a series of inwardly located shoulders in the said tube positioned at the inner end of the said housing to limit inward axial movement of a bearing in the said housing but generallymaintaining the normal tubular form between the said depressions, the said depressions increasing in depth outwardly toward the said bearing housing, the inner surface of the said tube where it forms said housing and the outwardly facing shoulders of the said depressions being machined, thereby to engage respectively the outer periphery and the inner face of the outer race of a bearing when inserted in said bearing housing,   and a keeper secured to said tube to urge the outer race of the said bearing against the said shoulders.     7#. a bearing tube according to claim 6 characterised in that a flange is formed at that end portion of the tube which forms the said housing, and said keeper is secured to the said flange.   8. a bearing tube according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in that said tube is formed by two flanged sections joined together to define two axially aligned but spaced apart bearing housings each having between the bearing housing and the flange the said peripherally spaced depressed lugs.
