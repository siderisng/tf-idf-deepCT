<ABSTRACT>
a programmable medical device, e. g.  a cardiac  pacemaker, utilizes digital circuitry 40 for controlling circuitry  42 for providing clocks, an output circuit and heart activity  sensing.  digital circuit 40 includes a memory in which may be  programmed on a permanent or temporary basis from an  external programmer control information relating to rate,  pulse width, pulse amplitude, refractory period, sense amp­ lifier sensitivity and the mode of operation desired.  in addition  the output can be inhibited or a threshold margin test can be  performed in which a reduced energy output pulse is pro­ vided to check if heart capture is lost.  the pacemaker can  operate in a hysteresis mode and provides a high rate limit  which can however be exceeded by programming.  the  pacemaker further includes means for signalling the accep­ tance of a programming signal and means to reset the prog­ ram acceptance circuit if extraneous signals are detected as  programming signals.  the acceptance circuit checks for the  receipt of the proper number of signals within a given time, for  an access code and correct parity.  timing is by means of a  crystal oscillator and a voltage controlled oscillator controls  pulse width to obtain energy compensation with varying bat­ tery voltage.
