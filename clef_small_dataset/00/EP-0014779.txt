<ABSTRACT>
Smoke detector with a pulmically operated radiation source (4) and a scattered radiation receiver (6) connected in a coincidence circuit (K).This circuit includes a counting device (B) which counts both the radiation pulses and the incoming stray pulses.With undisturbed operation, this counter (B) shows a straight counter reading after each radiation pulse.The appearance of an odd number of meter reading indicates the occurrence of interference pulses and leads to zero to the reset of the payer, so that the reaching of a measurement reading sufficient for signaling is prevented.For predefined straight-to-high meter reading, however, the signaling takes place.Such a smoke detector is almost unbeatable by disturbance pulses and does not tend to erroneous signaling.His operational safety is significantly improved.It is particularly suitable for use as fire alarms.
