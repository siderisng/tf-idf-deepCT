<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel N-oxalyl derivatives of N-phenyl-amino acid (n) (esters), multiple methods for their preparation and their use as fungicides. The compounds of the general formula in which R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ have the meaning given in the description are obtained by obtaining N-phenyl-amino acid (N) (esters) with chlor glyoxylsäu Reestern, in the presence of a solvent and rather converted into the presence of an acid binder and / or in the presence of a catalyst; In addition, there are other synthetic routes. The active substances according to the invention have a strong microbicide effect and could be practically used to combat unwanted microorganisms. The active ingredients are suitable for use as pesticides. As such, the active compounds according to the invention can be used with particularly good success to combat the pathogen of the cabbage and brown rotation of the tomato and carato. Particularly noteworthy is that the inventive substances do not only develop a protective effect, but they are also systematically effective.
