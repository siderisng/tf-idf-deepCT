<ABSTRACT>
gelation of aqueous solutions and especially aqueous  alcoholic solutions of the more active antiperspirant ac­ tive compounds described in german patent application  2 700 711 and comprising a basic aluminium chloride,  bromide, iodide or nitrate having an aluminium to chloride,  bromide, iodide or nitrate molar ratio of from 6. 5 to 1. 3:1  and which compound forms in water a solution contain­ ing polymeric species of a size greater than 100 angstroms  within which species there is contained from 2 to 80% by  weight of the total aluminium, is inhibited by including  urea in the solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
antiperspirants this invention relates to antiperspirant compositions. for inhibiting perspiration, the application to the skin of many different antiperspirant active compounds has been described in the literature. however, those compounds most widely used in commercial products at the present time are basic aluminium halides, especially aluminium chlorhydrate, which has an al/cl molar ratio of about 2. these active compounds are applied to the skin from a variety of applicator types including aerosol sprays, pump sprays, squeeze packs, roll-ons and stick applicators. thus aluminium chlorhydrate, for examples is employed as the active ingredient of various liquid, cream, stick or dry powder antiperspirant compositions. however, in spite of the popularity of aluminium chlorhydrate the presently available products are capable of producing only limited reduction in perspiration. in our german patent application p 27 00 711.0, incorporated herein by reference, and referred to hereinafter as the first application, there is described an improved antiperspirant active compound which comprises a basic aluminium chloride, bromide, iodide and nitrate having an aluminium to chloride, bromide, iodide or nitrate molar ratio of from 6.5 to 1.3:1, and which compound forms in water a solution containing polymeric species of a size greater than 100 angstroms within which species there is contained at least 2% by weight of the total aluminium. since in aqueous solutions of the basic aluminium compounds the halide or nitrate is in ionic form the polymeric species present are hydroxyaluminium species. the antiperspirant active compound may be employed in the form of an aqueous solution or the solution may be spray dried to give a hydrated compound of the empirical formula: al2 (oh)axaflho where x is cl, br, i or n03, a is from about 0.3 to 1.5 and n is from about 0.3 to 8. as described in said first application, these special forms of basic aluminium compounds which in aqueous solution contain polymeric species having a size greater than 100 angstroms within which at least 2% by weight of the total aluminium is contained, may be prepared by heating aqueous solutions of basic aluminium compounds at elevated temperature. the production of the desired species depends on the appropriate choice of the reaction conditions which are interrelated. it is preferred to use temperatures of from 800c to 1400c, the period of heating may be shorter as higher temperatures are used, ranging for example from 0.5 hour to 30 days. of importance is the concentration of the basic aluminium compound starting material. the rate of production of the higher polymeric species of the basic aluminium compound decreases as the concentration of the solution is increased and at the above temperatures the concentration should be no more than about 35% by weight. in our german patent application p 28 18 321.3 and referred to herein as the second application, we have described an improvement in aqueous solutions of the antiperspirant agents bf the first application. this improvement consisted in the inclusion in the solution of a neutral amino acid, by which was meant an amino acid
