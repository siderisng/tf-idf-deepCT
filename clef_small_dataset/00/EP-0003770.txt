<ABSTRACT>
device for steering and guiding objects, such as the lamellae of a blind, along a rail (2), the objects being movable between a position in which they are arranged pulled together at one region of the rail (2), and a position in which they are preferably uniformly distributed along the rail (2), and are connected together via means (7) which permit a spacing alteration between two adjacent objects.  by exerting a tensile force on the object which is arranged farthest to the outside, for example on the lower strip of a blind, the objects can be moved.  mounted on the object lying farthest to the outside is a transport slide (1) movable along the rail, the dimensioning of which slide in the longitudinal direction of the rail (2) being chosen so that the objects rest on the slide (1) in their pulled-together state, the height of which slide being calculated so that the objects resting thereon are raised with respect to the rail (2).  <image>
