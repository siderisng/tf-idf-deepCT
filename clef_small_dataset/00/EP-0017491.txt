<ABSTRACT>
a method is described for preparing a solid fuel, in either  powder or briquette form, for use in small furnaces.  the fuel has a relatively uniform heating value of  12,000-14,000 btu per pound and is prepared by crushing  and grinding coal to less than 200 mesh and drying and  oxidizing the coal with a hot gas containing a trace of oxygen  to a dried moisture content of 1-15%.  selected quantities of  additives having approximately the same fineness are  combined with the coals to minimize the effects of sulfur, to  improve combustion and ash properties, to maintain fluidity  of the solid fuel in powder form, to inhibit moisture pick-up,  and to prevent auto-ignition and spontaneous combustion  during storage of the solid fuel.
