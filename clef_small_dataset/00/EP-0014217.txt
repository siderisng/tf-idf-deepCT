<ABSTRACT>
in order to permit a corrugated hose to maintain its length  constant in any one of its expanded and collapsed states a  synthetic resin wall (1) has modulus of flexural rigidity in the  range of from 2,500 kg/cm² to 14,000 kg/cm².  further, a circumferential  bent portion across a crest (3) is arranged such  that one circumferential end of the bent portion is located at  the side of a valley (4) and another circumferential end is  located at the side of the crest (3).  upon expanding or collapsing  the hose, the oblique wall portion merging with the higher  end of the bent portion is inverted to allow the hose to maintain  its length in its state.
