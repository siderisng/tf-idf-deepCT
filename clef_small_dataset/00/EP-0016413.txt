<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for determining the identity of a transmission (UE) in telecommunications, in particular remote intercoms, which is fixedly assigned to a specific area of ​​a specified by an incoming connection line individually and thus depends in the construction of a telephone connection, in particular an international telephone connection. can be proved by the area of ​​origin of the calling participant. For the tariff determination of landscreams must be in the foreign route tax office u. a. these origin areas will be known. For this purpose, the individual NEN, a particular degree of origin identifying incoming remote selection transmissions will be queried for this purpose. As an indication switching of the individual test circles, one optocoupler serves each. (OK) To eliminate stupid pulses, the evaluation is contacted (V). The self-fed test pulse (UP) is deregazed independently of a registration already made by one of the optocouplers at least for a period exceeding the maximum recovery time period. This can be detected, for example, misalignments resulting due to cable management.
