<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for refining pulp stock in which  the pulp material is ground in a grinding space (34, 42)  defined between a pair of rotatable grinding discs (18, 20)  having ridges and grooves providing opposing grinding  surfaces (26, 28, 30, 32), which discs (18, 20) rotate relative to  one another in an environment of a fluid medium under  superatmospheric pressure and correspondingly elevated  temperature in a housing (10).  the grinding space includes a  first grinding zone (34) extending from a central portion of  the discs and a second grinding zone (42) extending  angularly from the first grinding zone (34).  the first grinding  zone (34) is defined between the relatively rotatable discs  (18, 20), while the second grinding zone (42) is defined  between one of the rotatable discs (18) and a stationary  grinding surface (44) on at least a portion of the surface of a  stationary element (46) mounted within said housing (10)  and spaced apart from the other (20) of said rotatable discs to  provide a gap for preventing contact between the periphery  of said disc (20) and said stationary element (46).
