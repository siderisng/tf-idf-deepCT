<ABSTRACT>
derivatives of substituted n-alkyl imidazoles of the  formula    wherein r¹ is phenethyl and r² is phenyl, each of said  phenethyl or phenyl independently being unsubstituted or  substituted in the phenyl ring by from 1 to 3 substituents  selected from the group consisting of halo, lower alkyl or  lower alkoxy with the proviso that at least one of r¹ and r² be  substituted by lower alkoxy; x is oxygen or sulfur; and the  antimicrobial acid addition salts thereof are useful as  antifungal, antibacterial and antiprotozoal agents.  they can  be prepared by etherification or thioetherification of the  corresponding compounds having -oh in place of -xr²; or  by reaction of r¹ch(y)ch₂sr² and or r¹ch(sr²)ch₂y with  imidazole, wherein y is a leaving group.
