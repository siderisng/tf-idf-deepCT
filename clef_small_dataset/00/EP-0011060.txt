<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for manufacturing elements, in particular building elements such as moulded blocks, from a plastic, gradually hardening mass, preferably concrete, furnished with a number of movable conveying devices between a starting station serving for moulding these elements and an end station serving for the discharge of the finished elements which are suitable for the reception of usually several elements at a time and equipped with loading compartments for this purpose which are at times air-conditioned during the course of the conveyance of the elements to the end station, characterized by the fact that solid walls of these individual conveying devices form loading compartments closed on five sides, whose open side within the conveying distance is temporarily coverable and lockable for air-conditioning the loading compartments either by means of a solid wall of a neighbouring, similar conveying device or by a separate, self-moving covering forming a unit with the conveying device or stationary walls.
