<ABSTRACT>
a process and apparatus are described for stripping  uranium values from a uranium-loaded organic extractant  phase containing, usually, a tertiary amine capable of forming  organic-soluble uranium complexes.  the sulphate-containing  aqueous strip liquor is fed in co-current with  the extractant phase to be stripped through a number of  mixing stages in series connected one to another without  intermediate settling stages and finally to a final settling  stage.  a "primary" dispersion is maintained in each  mixing stage and controlled stepwise ph adjustment of  the mixing stages is effected by metered addition of a base,  such as ammonia.
