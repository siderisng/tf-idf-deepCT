<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for the manufacture of explo足 sive fusecord the method comprising continuously advancing  and convoluting a carrier tape into hollow tubular form, feed足 ing a stream of explosive material into the tubular carrier tape  to form an explosive core encased by the carrier tube and  subsequently applying reinforcing materials around said car足 rier tube, said carrier tape being convoluted by passing  through shaping guide means, the passage of the carrier tape  through the guide means being assisted by pulling an auxili足 ary transport belt through the guide means, said transport  belt being in frictional contact with said carrier tape.  the method facilitates higher fusecord production  speeds by preventing stretching or rupture of the carrier  tape.
