<ABSTRACT>
an electrolytic cell comprises an electrolysing chamber  (42) having a pair of terminal electrodes (62,66) located  therein and adapted to be connected to the poles of a d. c.   source.  a plurality of bipolar electrodes in the form of  parallel flat annular discs (33) are located in the chamber  between the terminal electrodes and are rotatable about a  common central axis through their centres.  an electrolyte  inlet is located radially outwardly of the bipolar electrodes.  in  order to provide vigorous scouring of the bipolar electrodes  with relative low fluid flows to the cell, the electrolyte inlet  comprises one or more elongate slots (54) formed in the  cylindrical wall of the chamber and extending in a direction  generally perpendicular to the planes containing the bipolar  disc electrodes.
