<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing a plurality of electrically conductive strips arranged in a plurality of electrically conductive strips arranged parallel to each other with a grid size of about 1/10 of the light wavelength. The method is characterized in that a first method step is provided, in which a wavy, dune-like layer of conductive material is applied with a pierode of approximately surface ripple with a pierode of approx. 50 nm with a pierode of about 50 nm with a pierode of approximately 50 nm with a pierode of approx. 50 nm with a pierode of approx. 50 nm with a pierode of approx. 50 nm with a pierode of approx. 50 nm with a pierode of approx. and that a second method step is provided in which a predetermined strength of the dune-like layer is removed by particle bombard under a predetermined shot angle, so that an arrangement of a plurality of parallel to one another, separate and thus electrically isolated from each other microstrip on the glass carrier plate is formed.
