<ABSTRACT>
water-dispersible, uniformly hydrophilic polyolefin fib­ ers are prepared by treatment of an aqueous suspension of  spurted polyolefin fibers with an aqueous solution of a  water-soluble ionized reagent capable of being converted into  hydrated solid particles submicron in size to form a dispersion  of said fibers and then adding to the dispersion an ionic  precipitant for the ionized reagent.  representative of the ion­ ized reagent and the ionic precipitant are the sodium salt of  hydrogenated rosin and papermakers' alum, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of hydrophilic polyolefin fibers for use in papermakinc. this invention relates to a process for the preparation of hydrophilic polyolefin fibers which are readily dispersible in water and which can be blended with wood pulp fibers to provide a pulp which can be made into high quality paper using conventional papermaking techniques. more particularly, this invention relates to formation of polyolefinbased fibers and treatment of these fibers by precipitating on the surfaces thereof a hydrated material of submicron dimensions. the presence of the hydrated material on the fiber surface renders the fiber uniformly hydrophilic and ionic. in recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been expended in the development of water-dispersible, fibrous polyolefin pulps having hydrophilic properties. one procedure developed for the purpose of attaining such properties is that described in u.s. 3,743,570 to yang et al, assigned to crown zellerbach corporation. according to this patent, polyolefin fibers having a high surface area are treated with a hydrophilic colloidal polymeric additive composed of a cationic polymer such as melamine-formaldehyde and an anionic polymer such as carboxymethyl cellulose. another procedure developed for the preparation of water-dispersible, hydrophilic polyolefin pulps has been one involving the spurting of a mixture of the polyolefin and an additive such as a hydrophilic clay or a hydrophilic polymer, for example, polyvinyl alcohol. the spurting process used in these preparations is one in which the polyolefin and the hydrophilic additive are dispersed in a liquid which is not a solvent for either component at its normal boiling point, heating the resulting dispersion at superatmospheric pressure to dissolve the polymer and any solvent-soluble additive, and then discharging the resulting composition into a zone of reduced temperature and pressure, usually atmospheric, to form the fibrous product. a deficiency of these polyolefin pulps has been that, when they have been blended with wood pulp, the resulting paper products have exhibited considerably less strength than that of a paper prepar-ed from wood pulp alone. however, some improvement in the strength of paper made from blends of polyolefin pulps and wood pu#lp has been realized by imparting an anionic character to the polyolefin pulp. for example, in their german application no 413,922, filed march 22, 1974 and published october 17, 1974 as no. 2,413,922, toray industries, inc. have disclosed the preparation of anionic p#ulps by spurting mixtures of polyolefins and copolymers of olefinic compounds with-maleic anhydride or acrylic or methacrylic acids. blends of these pulps with wood pulp have provided paper with better tensile strength than #paper made without the copolymer component. moreover, in belgian patent no. 850,721 to hercules incorporated, it is disclosed that paper having further improved strength properties can be prepared by forming a spurted fibrous anionic polyolefin composition containing carboxylic functionality, for example#, a spurted fibrous composition comprising a mixture of a polyolefin and a carboxyl-containing anionic polymer, and then modifying this fibrous product by intimately contacting the fibers in a dilute aqueous solution or dispersion of a blend of a certain type of cationic, water-soluble,
