<ABSTRACT>
pentachloropyridine and polychloro derivatives of  2-(trichloromethyl)pyridine are prepared by reacting 2,4-­ dichloro-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine in the liquid state with  chlorine at temperatures of at least 160°c in the presence of a  lewis acid type catalyst.  the products are useful as herbi­ cides, pesticides, or as chemical intermediates for the prep­ aration of other products useful, for example, as herbicides or  pesticides.

<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of polychlorinated pyridines from 2, 4-dichloro-6- (trichloromethyl )pyridine the present invention concerns the preparation of pentachloropyridine and polychloro pyridines such as 2,3,4-trichloro-, 2,4,5-trichloro- and 2,3,4,5 -tetrachloro-6- (trichioromethyl )pyridine. the chlorinated pyridine derivatives prepared by the process of the present invention are known compounds having been previously prepared by a number of processes. these compounds have uses such as herbicides, pesticides, etc., and are also employed as chemical intermediates in the preparation of other highly desired herbicide or pesticide products.. previous methods for preparing such compounds include those described in u.s. patent nos. 3,538,100 and 3,186,994. thus, according to the '100 patent, pentachloropyridine (hereinafter referred to for convenience as "penta") has been prepared by chlorination of liquid 2,6-dichloropyridine at temperatures of at least about 1800c and in the presence of a metallic halide catalyst. polychloropyridines, including penta, are also produced according to the '994 patent by chlorinating a polychloro(trichloromethyl)pyridine reactant in the liquid state at a temperature of at least 1600c, preferably under irradiation with ultraviolet light. according to the present invention, it has been found that chlorinated pyridine compounds selected from the group consisting of pentachloropyridine, 2,3,4-trichloro-, 2,4,5-trichloro- and 2,3,4,5-tetra chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine can be obtained in a process which comprises contacting liquid 2,4-dichloro-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine with chlorine at temperatures of from about 1600c in the presence of a lewis acid type catalyst. the reaction can be practiced to convert most or all of the 2,4-dichloro-6 - (trichloromethyl )pyridine to pentachloropyridine, e.g., convert the trichloromethyl radical to a chloro radical with accompanying replacement of hydrogen on the ring, or to obtain optimum amounts of the polychloro derivatives of (trichloromethyl)pyridine. the process can also be carried out to provide mixtures of said products which can be separated from each other. the process is preferably carried out under anhydrous conditions. use of the 2,4-dichloro- and 2,3,4-trichloro- and/or 2,4,5-trichloro-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine derivatives or mixtures thereof as starting materials also forms a part of the invention. the process of the present invention is carried out by preferably using 2,4-dichloro-6-(trichloro methyl )pyridine as the starting material, although mixtures of the same with the trichloro derivatives, or one of the trichloro derivatives alone can be used as a starting reactant to prepare 2,3,4,5-tetrachloro -6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine and/or pentachloropyridine. the invention, in its broadest aspect, thus comprises contacting a starting material of the formula: emi3.1 wherein r and r' are each independently chloro or h, with the proviso that at least one of r and r' is h, in the liquid phase with chlorine at a temperature of at least about 1600c and in the presence of a lewis acid type catalyst. preferably, a starting material wherein r and r' are both h is employed. in another embodiment, a starting material wherein r is chloro and r' is h is preferably employed. in still another embodiment, a starting material wherein r is h and r is chloro is preferred. in a further embodiment, the starting material preferably comprises a mixture of the compounds encompassed by the above formula. in carrying out the process of
