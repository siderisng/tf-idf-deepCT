<ABSTRACT>
radiowaves antenna basically consisting of a parabolic  reflector and a feed, able to radiate according to mode te₁₁,  or according to the combination of modes te₁₁ and tm₁₁,  characterized in that, in case of radiation according to mode  te₁₁, said reflector has a ratio (f d) between the focal  distance (f) and the maximum diameter (d) comprised  between 0,46 and 0,50 and said feed has a ratio (α) between  the aperture radius (a) and the central wavelength τ of the  utilized frequency band comprised between 0,52 and 0,60:  also characterized in that, in case of radiation according to  the combination of modes te₁₁ and tm₁₁, a direct and linear  proportionality is defined between said ratio (f/d) of the  reflector and said ratio (α) of the feed.
