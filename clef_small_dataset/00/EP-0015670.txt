<ABSTRACT>
a jet of liquid (3) is deposited from a reservoir outlet  (2) on to a moving surface (4) located below the outlet.   desposition is effected by discharging a jet of the liquid on  to the underside of a curved guide member (5) which is  disposed between the outlet and the moving surface and  which is oriented so as to cause the liquid to flow down  the member on its underside so that its direction of flow  approaches the direction of travel of the moving surface.  the invention is particularly advantageous in the proÂ­ duction of paper webs, especially multi-layer paper webs  on a fourdrinier paper-making machine.
