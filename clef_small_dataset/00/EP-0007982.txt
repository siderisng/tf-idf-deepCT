<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure relates to a self-sealing pneumatic tire  (10) with puncture sealing properties and a method of  manufacturing such a tire.  the puncture sealant properties  of the self-sealing tire are provided by a layer (15) com­ prised of a blend of a crosslinked polymeric material and  an irradiation degraded polymeric material.  the method of  this disclosure comprises providing a layer (15) of rubber  compound with a blend of polymeric materials, one of which  degrades upon exposure to irradiation and another which  crosslinks either on exposure to irradiation, by chemical  reaction at vulcanization temperature, or both, assembling  the layer into an unvulcanized tire in situ with the poly­ meric materials unaltered, vulcanizing the tire without alter­ ing the degradable polymeric material and irradiating the  tire whereby the degradable polymeric material is degraded  to a low viscosity to form a tacky material and the cross­ linkable polymeric material is crosslinked to form an elastic  matrix for the degraded polymeric material, whereby the  layer has puncture sealing properties.
