<ABSTRACT>
a multistage flash evaporator for evaporating a solvent  from a solution, in which a housing with side walls is divided  by divider walls into a plurality of stages maintained, during  operation of the evaporator, at successively decreasing pressures.   condenser structures consisting of chambers (34, 36)  extending between the side walls (18, 20) are arranged in the  upper portion of, and next to, two adjacent evaporation  stages (11, 13) and the chambers (34, 36) are divided by a  partition (32) into two sections (34 and 36), one in communication  with one and the other section being in communication  with the other of said two adjacent evaporation stages  (11, 13) the condenser tubes (30) extending between the side  walls (18, 20) of the housing and serially through the two sections  (34, 36), of the condenser chambers in a direction general  parallel to said divider walls (12, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
multi-stage flash evaporator design this invention relates to a multi-stage flash evaporator as used in the desalting of seawater. within the field of seawater desalting, there are two basic design configurations which have been successfully and widely applied to the design of multi-stage flash evaporators since the advent of the msf evaporator system in the 1950's. these design configurations are commonly referred to within the field as "cross-tube" ("cross-flow") and "long-tube" ("long-flow") design. this designation is derived from the orientation of the condenser tubing in relation to the direction of flow of the flashing brine stream as it progresses from evaporator stage to evaporator stage beneath the condenser tubing. one of the primary advantages of the "cross tube" configuration lies in its ability to operate with relatively low thermal losses at extremely low mass flow rates of the brine flowing from stage to stage. these low mass flow rates yield lower brine levels and permit the use of flash devices and flash enhancers which can significantly increase the brine/vapor interface areas resulting in more efficient flashing and reduced non-equilibrium losses. this in turn reduces the required heat transfer surface area for each stage of the condenser. in addition, the "cross-tube" configuration permits the passage of brine from stage to stage under very low pressure differential between stages without incurring high or unstable brine levels within the upstream stage, and thus permits the use of a greater number of stages within a fixed temperature differential. vapor flashed within the "cross-tube" stage can flow in a uniform manner through the mesh entrainment separator to the full length of the condenser tubes within the tube bundle. the primary disadvantage of the "cross-tube" multi-stage flash evaporator design configuration resides in its initial cost in that each stage of the unit comprises essentially an individual condenser with an inlet and an outlet tube sheet, attendant tube joints, and inlet and outlet water boxes which must be interconnected to each adjacent stage of the unit. with respect to the "long-tube" design configuration, field experience in recent years has shown that the high mass flow rates which are common to this configuration often results in abnormally high brine levels and high thermal losses, particularly within the high temperature stages, and excessive erosion/corrosion by the flashing brine stream. each stage of the "long-tube" configuration contains highly irregular or non-uniform vapor flow patterns as the flash vapor at the entrance flows toward the cooler end of the condenser. another major disadvantage of the "long-tube" design configuration which is now beginning to be more prevalent among those evaporators installed in the 1960's is that when there is a condenser tube failure the distillate (product water) from a series of stages is contaminated. frequently the evaporator is forced off-the-line for location and plugging of the failed tube. however, in a tube failure within a "crosstube" design, the distillate in each stage can be readily sampled and tested to rapidly determine the source of the leak and once the source is located
