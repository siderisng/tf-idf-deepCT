<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a unit consisting of a one-piece, container-like, hollow cylindrical support shell (17) made of moldable film with integral end walls (2) and central opening (4) in this, with hollow rod (8) made of longitudinally gathered hose in the support shell cavity, wherein surrounding the support sleeve with the release of its cavity mouth openings, in which the support shell end walls (2) are pyramid-stumpy such that they each have at least two, with respect to the end wall centers radially extending form-permanent end wall edges (5); The invention further relates to a method for producing designated unit, in which one is arranged around a hollow rod a cylindrical shell of moldable film, which is in their length such that shell supernatants each protrude beyond the hollow monochromas, in this, then in each case Partial constriction of their inner diameters at least two formed by manent mold-proof film folds with outwardly facing folding edge and transferred them into permanent form-resistant state. The invention further relates to the use of the radio tional unit in the sausage production.
