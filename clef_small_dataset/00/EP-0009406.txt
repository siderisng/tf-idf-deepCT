<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a method of producing metal  electrodes by treating a metal electrode substrate so as  to coat the substrate surface with a homogeneous solution  of the compounds of (i) at least one metal selected from  a first group of iron, cobalt, nickel and manganese (ii) at  least one other metal selected from a second group of  molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium, each of which com­ pound is capable of thermal decomposition to the corre­ sponding metal oxide.  the coated substrate is then ther­ mally decomposed and the oxide-coated substrate is cured  in a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperature.  sub­ strates coated with ni-mo oxides are preferred.  the elec­ trodes thus produced exhibit very low overvoltage, are of  high stability with respect to their activity and can be used  as cathodes for the electrolysis of water or brine.
