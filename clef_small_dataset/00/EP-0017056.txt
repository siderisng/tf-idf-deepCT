<ABSTRACT>
slide fastener tape (10) including a tape body (11)  comprising interlaced warp ends (13) and weft picks (14) and  a beaded edge (12) having a core member (15) disposed  parallel to the tape body at one side thereof and a plurality of  appendant warp ends (16) which form a circular weave with  the weft picks (14) of the tape body (11) enclosing the core  member (15).  according to this invention, the appendant  warp ends (16) are placed only on the upper and lower sides  of the core member (15) so as to make the cross section of  the finished beaded edge (12) generally rectangular with a  height greater than the width.

<DESCRIPTION>
slide fastener tape this invention relates to a woven tape used for slide fasteners. particularly, the invention relates to a woven tape having an improved beaded edge to which fastener elements may be firmly and reliably fixed. heretofore, a fastener tape has been well known in which a core member is disposed in parallel to one side edge of the tape and warp ends are provided around the outer periphery of the core member, a circular weave being made between the warp ends and the weft picks of the tape body to form a beaded edge comprising the core member and the encircling warp ends. fastener elements made of metal or injection molded plastics are fixed to the tape by clamping the beaded edge by their upper and lower legs. -since a cord is used as a core member, the cross section of the core member is generally circular. furthermore, the warp ends are evenly disposed around the core member. therefore, the resulting beaded edge also has a circular cross section. the tape is first formed in a long continuous woven web and the fastener elements are fixed to the tape by clamping the beaded edge of the tape by their legs. before the fastener elements are fixed to the tape, the tape is subjected to various processes such as a dyeing process. during these processes, the tape is taken up on a drum or roller and by this taking up operation, the beaded edge -cpnstructed as above is pressed into a flat shape. since the beadèd-edge has originally a circular cross section, the flattened beadedqge presents generally elliptical configuration. the elliptical¯shape is disadvan tageous because a sharp edge or distinct step is not formed between the beaded portion and the body of the tape. furthermore, in case of a flat beaded edge it is very likely that the laterally expanded inner side portion of the beaded edge is not received in the space defined by the two legs of an element and the inwardly bent end portions of the legs. if this occurs, securement of the element becomes unreliable and the inwardly bent end portions of the legs damage the weft picks of the beaded edge. fastener tapes having the beaded edges of the abovementioned kind are disclosed in u.s. patent nos. 1,949,889 and 2,061,073 issued on march 6, 1934 and november 17, 1936, respectively and u.r. patent no. 758,533 published on october 3, 1956. however, none of them teaches an approach for eliminating the above described shortcomings. the object of this invention is to eliminate the abovementioned disadvantage of the previous beaded edges of fastener tapes by providing a woven tape in which a beaded edge is hard to be flattened and retains a generally rectangular cross section during processes from a weaving step to a fastener element fixing step. according to this invention, a fastener tape has a beaded edge which comprises a core member disposed along one of the longitudinal edges of a tape body, a

<CLAIMS>
we claim:   1. a slide fastener tape including a tape body comprising interlaced warp ends and weft picks and a beaded edge having a core member disposed parallel to the tape body at one longitudinal edge thereof and a plurality of appendant warp ends which form circular weave with the weft picks of the tape body enclosing the core member, characterized in that said plurality of appendant warp ends are placed only on the upper and lower sides of the core member to form upper and lower warp groups each consisting of a plurality of appendant warp ends so as to make the cross section of the finished beaded edge generally rectangular with a height greater than the width.    2. a slide fastener tape according to claim 1 further characterized in that said core member is made of a knitted core.   3. a slide fastener tape according to claim 1 or 2 further characterized in that the appendant warp end closer to the tape body in each of said upper and lower warp groups is thicker than the other appendant warp ends.   4. a slide fastener tape according to claim 1 or 2 further characterized   in that    sub-core members of narrower cross section than the core member are disposed at the inner side of the core member adjacent the tape body and vertically spaced so that they are placed on the opposite sides of the plane of the tape body.
