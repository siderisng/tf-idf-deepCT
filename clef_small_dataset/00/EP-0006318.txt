<ABSTRACT>
shaped reinforced articles formed from a water-­ hardenable mass having dispersed at least through a por­ tion of the mass cut, longitudinally oriented fibrous rein­ forcing elements formed from synthetic plastics material  each of which has a microscopic and/or macroscopic key­ ing action with the hardened water hardenable mass.  the  elements are preferably formed from novel films, fibres or  filaments the surface of each of which is provided with  voids and/or indentations and/or protuberances and/or  striations most of which have a width or diameter of 150  microns or less.  the reinforced articles are produced by  dispersing the fibrous reinforcing elements in an aqueous  slurry of the water-hardenable mass and the mass then  hardened.

<DESCRIPTION>
d:e:scripidion "reinforced shaped apmiicis3, tie production thereof and novel fibrr3 and fila.fthtts for use therein". the present invention relates to reinforced, shaped articles made from a water-hardenable mass, method of forming such articles and novel fibres and filaments for use therein. it has been known for many years to provide waterhardenable masses with fibrous contents composed of inorganic fibres such as asbestos, the fibres being mixed with an aqueous slurry of the water-hardenable mass. it has also been proposed to use glass fibre as a reinforcing material in water-hardenable masses. in an attempt to substitute synthetic r-lastics materials for inorganic materials it has been proposed to use sheets of synthetic plastics film which have been preformed into a network of interconnected fibres as reinforcing elements in water-hardenable masses. such use, however, requires a new type of technology in which it is not possible to use existing plant and machinery hitherto used for the production of asbestos or glass fibre containing water-hardenable masses. it has now been surprisingly found that cut, longitudinally oriented fibrous reinforcement elements formed from synthetic plastics material and which have a microscopic and/or macroscopic keying action with the hardened water-hardenable mass can be utilized to give an increased flexural strength to the water-hardenable mass and, furthermore can be utilized with existing machinery. in one embodiment the invention provides a shaped article formed from a water-hardenable mass (as hereinafter defined) and having dispersed at least through a portion thereof, cut longitudinal orientated fibrous reinforcsng elements finned from s-jiitbetic plastics material, each of said fibrous reinforcing elements having a microscopic and/or macroscopic keying action (as hereinafter defined) with the hardened water-hardenable mass. the concentration of fibrous reinforcing elements in that portion of the hardened water-hardenable mass may be from 0.5 to loss weight part of the hardened mass. in another embodiment the invention provides a method of producing shaped articles from a waterhardenable mass (as hereinafter defined) which comprises casting or moulding an article from a mixture of a water-hardenable mass and water at least a portion of said mixture of water-hardenable mass and water having dispersed therethrough cut, longitudinally orientated fibrous reinforcing elements formed from synthetic plastics material and having a microscopic or macroscopic keying action with the hardened water-hardenable mass, and hardening said mass. the synthetic plastics material may be any such material which is capable of being formed into filaments or fibres which are longitudinally orientated and have the strength characteristics required for the article to be made. preferably the synthetic plastics material is a polypropylene or a copolymer of propylene with another olefin such as ethylene or mixtures of such polymers and/or copolymers or a mixture of polypropylene with another poly olefin such as polyethylene. ty the expression water-hardenable mass is to be understood a mass which comprises any dry or substantially dry inorganic material or mixture of materials which when mixed with water sets to a solid, rigid mass. portland cement and gypsum are examples of such materials. the portland cement may of course
