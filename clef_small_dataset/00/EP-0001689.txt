<ABSTRACT>
the invention provide compounds having the formula:    in which r₁ is iso-propyl or sec-butyl; r₂ is methoxy, hydroxy  or loweralkanoyloxy; and r₃ is hydrogen; lower alkanoyl;  α-l-oleandrosyl; 4′-(lower alkanoyl)-α-l- oleandrosyl;  4′-(α-l- oleandrosyl)-α-l-oleandrosyl or 4℞-(lower alkanoyl)-4′-(α-l- oleandrosyl)-α-l- oleandrosyl.   these compounds are  derivatives of c-076 and are produced by catalytic reduction  of the 22,23-position of the c-076 molecule.  further reaction  of the reduced c-076 compounds is also possible.  the compounds  thus produced are used for their profound anthelmintic,  insecticidal, ectoparasiticidal and acaracidal activity.   compositions containing the described c-076 derivatives as  active ingredient are also disclosed.
