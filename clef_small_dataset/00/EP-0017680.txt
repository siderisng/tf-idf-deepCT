<DESCRIPTION>
pyrimidone derivatives, process for preparing them and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. this invention relates to pharmacologically active pyrimidone derivatives, a process for preparing them, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. according to the present invention there- is provided a pyrimidone of structure (1) emi1.1 in which het is a 2- or 4- imidazolyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl (preferably methyl), halogen (preferably chlorine or bromine), trifluoromethyl or hydroxymethyl, a 2-pyridyl group optionally substituted by one or more(which can be the same or different) lower alkyl (preferably methyl), lower alkoxy (preferably methoxy), halogen (preferably chlorine or bromine), amino or hydroxy groups, a 2-thiazolyl group, a 3-isothiazolyl group optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, a 3-(1,2,5)- thiadiazolyl group optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, or a 2-(5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazolyl) group: y is sulphur or methylene; z is hydrogen or lower alkyl (preferably methyl); a is c1-c5 alkylene; and hetl is a pyridyl group substituted by hydroxy or n-oxd and optionally substituted by lower alkyl, or lower alkoxy. throughout this specification by the terms 'lower alkyl' and 'lower alkoxy' is meant alkyl and alkoxy groups containing 1 to4 carbon atoms which can be straight or branched. particular lower alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, l-propyl and 2-propyl. particular lower alkoxy groups are methoxy, ethoxy, l-propoxy and 2-propoxy. preferably het is a 5-methyl-4-imidazolyl, 5-bromo4-imidazolyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-methyl-2-pyridyl, 3-methoxy2-pyridyl, 3-ethoxy-2-pyridyl, 3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridyl, 3-fluoro-2-pyridyl, 3-chloro-2-pyridyl, 3-bromo-2pyridyl, 3-iodo-2-pyridyl, 3-bromo-4-methyl-2-pyridyl or 2-thiazolyl group. preferably z is hydrogen. preferably a is straight b(,w-alkylene, particularly methylene. particular meanings of hetl are 4-hydroxy-2-pyridyl, 6-hydroxy-3-pyridyl, 2-hydroxy-4-pyridyl, 4-hydroxy-5methyl-2-pyridyl, 6-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-pyridyl, 2hydroxy-6-methyl-4-pyridyl, 6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3pyridyl, n-oxo-3-pyridyl ,n-oxo-6-methyl-3-pyridyl, and n-oxo-4-pyridyl. preferably het is a pyridyl group substituted by hydroxy and optionally substituted by lower alkyl, and particularly 4-hydroxy-2-pyridyl, 6-hydroxy-3-pyridyl or 2-hydroxy-4-pyridyl. the compounds of the invention are shown and described as 4-pyrimidones and these exist in equilibrium with the corresponding 6-pyrimidones, and to a lesser extent in the following tautomeric forms: emi2.1 the 2-,4- and 6-hydroxypyridyl groups can exist as lh-pyrimidone tautomers, and certain of the het groups can exist in several tautomeric forms. all these tautomeric forms of the compounds of structure 1 are within the scope of the present invention. rn a process of the invention a compound of structure (1) is prepared by reacting a compound of structure (3); emi3.1 in which q is nitroamino (no2nh-), lower alkylthio, benzylthio, chlorine, bromine or other group which can be displaced with a primary amine, z and a are as defined for structure(lx and het2 is a pyridyl group substituted by hydroxy, a protected hydroxy group or n-oxo and optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, with an amine of structure (2 in which het and y are as defined for .s.tructure (1) and removal of any hydroxy protecting groups. this reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature in the absence of a solvent, for example at 800 to 170 , preferably 120 to 140 , or in a solvent at an elevated temperature, for example at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. the choice of solvent is affected
