<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for modifying a surface and a device for carrying out the same.The modification of the surface is carried out by means of plas mators or depositing a material in selected areas on the same.Before or during the generation of the gas plasma, the reactive gas is exposed to vacuum ultraviolet radiation whose energy is chosen so that it corresponds to the dissociation energy at least one of the reactive constituents of the gas.In one embodiment, a silicon haline ter covered with a silicon dioxide layer is treated with a gas plasma of CF₄ and O₂ which was exposed to a vacuum ultraviolet radiation with a 'wavelength kon Tinuum of 60 to 100 nm.
