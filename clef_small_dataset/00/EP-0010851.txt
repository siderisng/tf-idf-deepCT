<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a process for the preparation of  tetramisole which comprises the steps of:   (a) reacting an arylvinyl oxide having the formula:    with an alkoxyethylamine having the formula:  r₁-o-(ch₂)₂-nh₂ to obtain a novel n-(arylhydroxyalkyl)-­ alkoxyethylamine having the formula:   ar-ch(oh)-ch₂-nh-ch₂-ch₂-or₁,   wherein ar is phenyl and r₁ is a lower alkyl group;   (b) reacting the latter n-substituted alkoxyethylamine  with a nitrile having the formula r₂c≡n, where r₂ is hy­ drogen, alkyl, or aryl to obtain a novel amidoamine having  the formula: r₂-co-nh-ch(ar)-ch₂-nh-ch₂ch₂-or₁,   (c) hydrolyzing the latter amidoamine to obtain a novel  diamine having the formula   nh₂-ch(ar)-ch₂-nh-ch₂-ch₂-or₁,   (d) reacting the resultant diamine with carbon disulfide  to obtain a dithiocarbamate,   (a) heating the latter dithiocarbamate to produce a  thione having the formula;    (f) further reacting the thione with an acid having the  formula ha to provide an imidazothiazole having the for­ mula:    where a is an anion of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid,  and   (g) thereafter, neutralizing said tetramisole salt to  obtain tetramisole per se.  the invention also provides a process for resolving the  novel diamines obtained in step (c).
