<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a method of making a layered  electrical device having interconnections (34), which may be  microscopic in size, through an insulating layer (12a, 12b)  between two conducting layers (10, 11).  the insulating layer  is double, comprising a first layer (12a) resistant to a first  etching process but etchable by a second process, and a  second layer (12b) etchable by the first process but resistant  to the second.  a mask (30) is provided to define the position  of the required interconnection, and the second layer (12b) is  etched by the first process.  the first layer (12a) is then etched  by the second process, the second layer (12b) acting as a  hole-defining mask (32) during this step.  conducting material  is then deposited on the insulating layers to form the  second conducting layer (11) and the connection (34)  through the hole.
