<ABSTRACT>
a computer controlled asymmetric texture-sensitive  parafocussing x-ray powder diffractometer employs an  incremental rotating specimen holder for azimuthal rotation  through an angle ⊘.  the specimen holder is rotatable through  an angle α from a symmetric position in which the specimen  surface normal makes an angle (90-ϑ)° with both the source-­ to-specimen and detector-to-specimen directions.  in order to  maintain the brentano focussing condition, the detector is  supported on a slide which can be moved towards and away  from the specimen by a stepper-motor drive.  a ratio k of the  detector-to-specimen distance r on the one hand and the  x-ray source-to-specimen distance p on the other hand is  constrained to a range c < k < f.  the desired focussing  condition is realized by computer control which maintains k  = sin (ϑ + α)/sin(ϑ-α) and modifies the measured value of  the intensity by multiplying it by 0. 5 (k + 1) k0. 75exp [µr(k -  1)], where µ is the linear absorption coefficient for air.
