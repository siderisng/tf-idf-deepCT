<ABSTRACT>
rubber-tyred plastics wheels usually have a wheel disc body (2) which is divided in the middle and whose two wheel discs consist of injection moulded plastic and have been provided with moulded-on and mutually complementary hub (5) and rim parts (7) so that, after the rubber ring (1) has been laid into the rim bed, they are held together axially compressed and in the manner of a snap lock.  to be able to manufacture such plastics wheels even more simply and without assembly difficulties, as a unified whole as it were, first the elastomeric tyre is placed into an injection mould corresponding to the finished profile of the wheel and then the wheel disc body plastics composition is injected with sufficient pressure that the rubber tyre is widened to a greater extent at its inner circumference than corresponds to the subsequent shrinkage of the injection moulded plastic.  with wheels which are to be subjected to higher stresses it is possible, before the plastics composition (10) which forms the wheel disc body (2) is injected, also to place appropriately shaped filling bodies (11) or cores in the mould in order thereby to reduce the wall thickness and solidification time of the injection moulding.  this gives a stable, blister-free plastics wheel in a time- and labour-saving manner.  <image>
