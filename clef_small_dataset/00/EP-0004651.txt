<ABSTRACT>
an article molded from ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers,  which articles have superior stress crack resistance and  low temperature toughness.  this application is a continuation-in-part of copending  application serial no.  892,323 filed march 31, 1978.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to the use of ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers for preparing articles by injection molding and roto molding. there is currently a need for molded plastic articles such as, for example, lids, closures, food and garbage containers, bottles, dishpans and toys which provide stress crack resistance when in contact with detergents, vegetable oils and fats, and/or which have superior impact strength at low temperatures (i.e. ≦ 0°c). attempts have been made to mold these articles from high pressure ethylene homopolymers, or from blends of high density polyethylene and copolymers of ethylene and polar comonomers such as vinyl acetate or ethyl acrylate. however, the articles molded from high pressure polyethylenes have insufficient stress crack resistance and low temperature impact strength. the polar copolymer blends with high density polyethylene, though better than the high pressure polyethylenes in these properties, are very expensive to produce, are less translucent, have more odor, poorer electrical properties, a high hexane extractable level and are more prone to exhibit color segregation when compounded with pigments. gb-a-1 258 984 deals with a suspension polymerization for the production of homo- and copolymers of olefins in which the precursor from the magnesium compound and the titanium compound were either activated completely outside of the reaction medium or activated completely in the reaction medium. the obtained polymers shall have a narrow molecular weight distribution (mw/mn between 2 and 4), the most important property of the polymers is their excellent color and corrosion values. nothing is contained in this reference which shows that by different catalysts, a different activation of the catalyst and in a gas phase fluid bed process polymers may be obtained which have especially valuable properties, as it is shown below in the various tables. it has now been unexpectedly found that articles molded from ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers obtainable as herein described have superior stress crack resistance and low temperature properties. additionally, articles injection molded from such ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers have high surface gloss and are free from dull swirls. further, articles molded from said copolymers have excellent flex life, particularly when flexed across the direction of orientation. an object of the present invention is to provide molded articles of ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers having superior stress crack resistance and low temperature properties. a further object of the present invention is to provide articles injection molded from ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers of high gloss and essentially free from dull swirls. another object of the present invention is to provide articles molded from ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer which have low warpage. another object of the present invention is to provide articles molded from ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer of superior flex life. it has now been found that articles molded from ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers obtainable as herein described have superior stress crack resistance, low temperature properties and flex life, have high gloss, low warpage and are essentially free from dull swirls. the present invention relates to the use of low density ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer containing ≧ 90 mol percent of ethylene and ≦ 10
