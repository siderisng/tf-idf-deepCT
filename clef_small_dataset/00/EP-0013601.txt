<ABSTRACT>
a flow control valve comprises a closure member (2)  having a fluid passage there-through and a flow control  device (6) disposed in the passage of the closure member  which protrudes therefrom and which provides a variable  degree of restriction dependent upon the degree to which the  valve is opened.  the closure member in combination with the  flow control device provides an optimal restriction in the full  range of valve settings with decreasing restriction as the valve  is opened so that at the fully open position the flow control  device does not significantly restrict the flow of fluid.
