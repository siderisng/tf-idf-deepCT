<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula (i):    wherein:   r₁ is hydrogen or fluorine;   r₂ is hydrogen or hydroxy;   r₃ is hydrogen, hydroxy, fluorine, aminocarbonyl,  methylaminocarbonyl, methoxycarbonyl or acetoxy;   c and c both are asymmetric carbon atoms having  * and **   the r absolute stereochemical configuration;   with the limitation that at least one of r₁ and r₂ is  hydrogen;   or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are  extremely potent inotropic agents.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
optically active phenethanolamines, their formulations, use and preparation this invention relates to certain extraordinarily potent inotropic agents, to pharmaceutical formulations containing those compounds, to the use of the compounds in conditioning cardiovascular systems and to their preparation. some of the most extensive efforts in basic research have been in the area of d-phenylethylamine aerivatives, many of which are catecholamines. such compounds are known to have a variety of pharmacological activities. for example, the naturally occurring catecholamine epinephrine is a potent sympathomimetic drug and a powerful cardiac stimulant. however, epinephrine has found only limited utility in restoring cardiac function in cases of cardiac arrest, oven though it is one of the most potent vasopressor arugs known, and greatly increases systolic blood pressure. like most drugs of its class, the use of epinephrine is limited due to its undesirable side effects, which include fear, anxiety, tremor, tenseless, throbbing headache, increased blood pressure, dizziness, respiratory difficulty an palpitaticn as well as its short duration of action. other drugs similar to epinephrine both in structure and physiological properties include two other natural catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine, as well as isoproterenol, a synthetic drug. such sympatròrnirnetic agentsc2rrently are used to restore contractility in cardiogenic shock. however, like other drugs of this class, these agents have side effects which are life threatening, thus greatly inhibiting their clinical usefulness. certain catecholamines have been found to exert a positive inotropic effect on heart muscle without the detrimental side effect of significant increase in heart rate or distortion of cardiac rhythm or blood pressure. u.s. patent no. 3,987,200 discloses a method of increasing cardiac contractility utilizing compounds such as dl-3,4-dihydroxy-n [3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methyl-n-propyl]-ss-phenethyl- amine hydrochloride, now generically referred to as dobutamine. dobutamine is well suited for treating myocardial infarction with failure, congestive heart failure, cardiac by-pass surgery and traumatic surgery. however, like most other catechol derivatives, it is rapidly inactivated in a biological system by the actions of catechol-o-methyl transferase. dobutamine and its related drugs thus are restricted to intravenous infusion in hospitalized patients. even though numerous compounds which have inotropic properties are known, the use of such compounds is severely limited due to their accompanying undesirable side-effects and rapid metabolic inactivation. in many cases the treatment of congestive heart failure can only be effectively accomplished with the use of digitalis and allied cardiac glycosides. the main pharmacodynamic activity of digitalis is its ability to increase the force of myccardal contrac- tion. digitalis is thus widely used in the treatment of cardiac failure. whilst digitalis and its related glycosides are widely used, they remain some of the most dangerous drugs employed. all digitalis-type preparations are toxic at high dose levels. digitalis toxicity in the heart can be lethal, most of digitalis poisoning being due to the cumulative effect of maintenance doses taken over a relatively long period of time, or from the use of a large dose in the treatment of severe atrial arrhythmias. the applicants have now discovered that; surprisingly, the positive inotropic activity of a specific class of phenethanolamines
