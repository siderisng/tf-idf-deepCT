<ABSTRACT>
a spray nozzle for a dual-purpose shower system for  conditioning felt or wire fabric in a paper making process  has two operative conditions depending on the selected  function of the shower system.  in one condition the nozzle  provides a high pressure spray and in the other condition  it provides a low pressure purging flow, the condition  being determined by the relative location of an internal  plunger (28) with respect to a surrounding tubular body  (10) having a valve member (26) at one end thereof.  the  plunger (28) is slidable in the body (10) and has a through  passage (40) for the flow of liquid through the nozzle, and  the clearance between the plunger (28) and the valve  member (26) determines whether or not a spray or a purgÂ­ ing flow is discharged from the nozzle.  the supply of liquid  into the nozzle is controlled by co-operating openings (60,  20) and ports (62, 64) in the tubular body (10) and the  plunger (28) respectively.  these are arranged so that when  the plunger (28) is in the spray position a greater area is  open for the intake of liquid than when the plunger (28) is  in the purging position.  a spring (54) moves the plunger  (28) into the purge position and liquid pressure acting on  the plunger (2) moves it to the spray position.
