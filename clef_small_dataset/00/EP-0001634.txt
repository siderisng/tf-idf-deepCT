<ABSTRACT>
1.  a chain pulley or roller for round-link chain having sections (20) as chain support, having the following features : - the sections (20) are securely mounted in pairs on either side of a rim of a roller body (10) by means of axially parallel bolts or pins (14) - a metal section part is supported against a cylindrical surface of the rim characterised by the subsequently mentioned further features : - the sections (20) comprise a metal core (21) and a jacket of vulcanite-like plastics material, which jacket encloses the metal core (21) on all sides and forms an abutment portion (25) on the chain side.  - the metal core (21) and plastics material jacket are connected in form-locking manner by means of recesses (21a) formed in the metal cores (21) and filled with the plastics material - the metal cores (21) has bores (22) formed therein for receiving the pins (14) which bores are continued inwardly by ring discs (23) moulded or welded thereon - the plastics material jacket in the region of the bores (22) on the outside has recesses (28) formed therein.
