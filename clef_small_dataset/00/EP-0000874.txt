<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a machine tool with a common  drive for the worktable and pallet shuttle.  in accordance  with the invention, the worktable and pallet shuttle are  driven by a common motor (188) which is mounted on the  worktable base (10), thereby simplifying the machine tool  and reducing its cost.  the motor (188) is coupled to the  worktable (18) by gears (202, 116) which engage when  the worktable (18) is raised to be indexed and disengage  when the worktable (18) is lowered.  the motor (188) is  coupled to the pallet shuttle (54) by gears (202, 210, 212,  80) which engage when the worktable base (10) is moved  into the shuttle position and disengage when the worktable  base is moved out of the shuttle position.
