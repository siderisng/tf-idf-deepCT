<ABSTRACT>
a rolling machine for reducing the cross-sectional  dimensions of an elongate workpiece, such as a steel billet,  has pairs of alternately co-operating planetary rolls (14), each  of which is journalled in an roll carrier (12).  each carrier is  rotated about a carrier axis (13) which is inclined at an angle  of about 45Â° to the axis of rotation (15) of the roll journalled  in the carrier.  the carrier axes (13) of a universal planetary  mill form the sides of a square around the pass-line (28)  which is normal to the plane in which the carrier axes (13) are  located.  as the carriers (12) rotate the pairs of co-operating  planetary rolls (14) alternately sweep over the workpiece and  intermittently contact and reduce the workpiece in directions  which are mutually at right angles.  to avoid the formation of  sharp edges to the rolled workpiece, either each roll (14) is  collared to enclose a workpiece edge, or each carrier (12)  additionally carries an edger roll which rounds that edge.
