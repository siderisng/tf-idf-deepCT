<ABSTRACT>
Method for selectively producing contacts on semiconductor zones. A group of contact bores is protected by a barrier layer (24) during the metallization of another group of exposed contact bores, thereby improving the clean state and reliability of the contacts. The barrier layer is then removed and in both groups of contact bores a second metallization layer is crushed. In the preferred embodiment, a conventional diffusion mask is used for determining all the condation areas, and for shielding, an oxide layer (24) is grown thermally in each of the contact bores. A blocking photoresist mask is then applied and provided with a pattern that releases the oxide in those contact bores in which the first group of contacts is to be formed. The shielding oxide layer is then removed and a first metallization layer, which is preferably made of platinum silicide, is then formed. The shielding oxide layer (24) is then removed from the protected contact areas, and a second metallization layer, which may, for example, of chromium, aluminum or other metals or their alloys, is then deposited in all contact bores, so that in the second group of contact holes in the second group of contact holes A metallization layer and in the first group of contact bores two metallization layers are formed on top of each other.
