<ABSTRACT>
an example of a thermionic cathode comprises a  porous body (12) of tungsten impregnated with barium calcium  aluminate.  the body has a coating of osmium in isolated  squares (142) such that no portion of the surface of the coating  is more than 30 micron from an exposed surface of the body.   materials other than tungsten, barium calcium aluminate, and  osmium may be used.  the coating may be in a predetermined  pattern other than squares.  by providing a large amount of  interface between the coating and the exposed surface of the  body, electron emission is enhanced.
