<ABSTRACT>
a stable, uniform coke-oil dispersion is prepared by  grinding 15 to 55% by weight of coke particles in the absence  of free oxygen in a medium consisting essentially of gas oil  and/or a heavier petroleum fraction.  grinding is continued  until the size of the majority of the particles is reduced to a  value in the range 1 to 10 micron.  preferably the coke is uni­ formly dispersed in the gas oil and/or heavier petroleum frac­ tion prior to grinding.

<DESCRIPTION>
fuel composition and method for its preparation this invention relates to the production of dispersions of coke and oil. coal oil slurries have previously been disclosed, see for example, british patent specification 975687. whilst these behave as near newtonian non-settling fluids in pipelines, they separate on standing. thus such slurries are suitable for use immediately after preparation or pipelining but are not suitable for transportation by tanker nor for storage. british patent specification 396432 discloses the preparation of coal oil mixtures in which coal is preground before being contacted with oil. the coal is not ground in the presence of the oil. after mixing, the blend of coal and oil is passed through a homogeniser which disperses the coal particles uniformly in the oil but does not reduce their size. our british patent specification 1523193 discloses a method for the preparation of a uniform coal oil dispersion which method comprises grinding coal in a medium consisting essentially of gas oil and/or a heavier petroleum fraction until the particle size is reduced to a value below 10 micron and the dispersion contains 15 to 55% by weight coal, expressed as a percentage by weight of the total dispersion and until a stable dispersion results on ceasing grinding. by "stable dispersion" is meant a dispersion which does not separate into layers of its constituent compounds on standing at ambient temperature for at least six months. coal, however, is a complex organic mineral of high molecular weight. coke, although one form is derived from coal, has different properties in many respects, e.g. molecular weight, hydrogen content and the nature of its surface. we have now discovered stable coke oil dispersions which are suitable for pumping and storage and a method for their preparation. thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a uniformly dispersed, stable fuel dispersion containing 15 to 55% by weight, preferably 30 to 40% by weight, of coke particles, the size of the majority of the particles being in the range 1 to 10 micron, in a medium consisting essentially of a gas oil and/or a heavier petroleum fraction, the percentage being expressed as a percentage by weight of the total weight of the dispersion. according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the preparation of a stable, uniform coksoil dispersion which method comprises grinding 15 to 55%, preferably 30 to 40%, by weight of coke particles in the absence of free oxygen in a medium consisting essentially of gas oil and/or a heavier petroleum fraction until the size of the majority of the particles is reduced to a value in the range 1 to 10 micron, the percentage being expressed as a percentage by weight of the total weight of the dispersion. an important feature of the invention is the stability of the coke oildispersions produced. the stability is a function of three variables: the method of grinding in the presence of the oil, the final particle size and
