<ABSTRACT>
A two- or multi-layer dewatering screen, in which the layers are verbun through a binding chain, is therefore endless that at least two layers or two groups of layers are separated separately. The seams of the individual layers or groups of layers may be offset against each other in a sieve longitudinal direction. Preferably, at least one seam is a woven seam. The ends of a layer or some. Layers can also stump together and not be connected. The endless of the screen is carried out in such a way that a layer is detected in a manner known per se and the further layers through a woven seam will be endless. In the design of the woven seam, the warp threads are exposed to a certain length by making the firing threads on both weave (1, 2), the fabric ends (1, 2) are strained exactly parallel at a certain distance and become the exposed warp threads with weft threads ( 5) intertwined by using a weaving dish from the weft threads (5) a weaving compartment. The weft threads (5) are led out in the case of the already formed part of the woven seam at such an angle from the Siebevene, that the low-lying weft threads (5) in the sieving level or about lie. The thus endless dehydration sieve is characterized by its freedom of flavor.
