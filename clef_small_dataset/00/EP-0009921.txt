<ABSTRACT>
wheel means for mounting beneath a container to allow  the container to be moved is disclosed.  presently, there is no  device known to me which will allow a container to be conve­ niently moved once deposited in a warehouse or the like.  the wheel means (10) comprises a ground engaging means  (22, 100) preferably in the form of a wheel (22) or roller assem­ by (100) swivellably connected to a locking and locating  device (36, 26, 112, 131).  the locking and locating device may  be a rod and lug (36, 26) or two plates (112, 131) which engage  in the bottom of the container to lock the wheel means (10)  beneath the container.  the container may be moved by rolling  the container on the wheel means.  a loading and unloading device is also disclosed compris­ ing a ramp (46, 48, 50) which allows the container to be rolled  onto and off a truck or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
wheel means for container handling the present invention relates to handling of containers. containers are increasingly coming into use for the transport of materials. at the present time there is no practical system available for readily moving containers once they are unloaded from a transporter such as a truck or a railway flat car. this can cause problems in warehouses where it is desired to move a container from one location to another. the present invention provides wheel means for attachment to the underside of a container to enable the container to be moved. the present invention also provides a system for unloading containers from transporters in such a way that the unloaded containers can be moved. containers conventionally comprise a plurality of apertures adjacent each corner. typically, the containers have a corner block at each corner, each corner block comprising an under aperture, an end aperture and a side aperture. the apertures in the corner blocks are normally used for such purposes as attachment to the transporter during transportation and for attachment of crane hooks when the containers are being lifted. the present invention provides a wheel means arranged to be mounted with a corner aperture of a container, comprising a base plate having ground engaging means coupled to the underside thereof and a locating and locking device attached to the upper side thereof, said locating and locking device being arranged to engage with the corner aperture of the container. in use, a wheel means of the present invention is attached to each corner of the container and the container can be moved around at will such as by means of a forklift truck. the ground engaging means may be a plurality of rollers. the rollers may have a caterpillarlike track or belt thereabout or may engage the ground themselves. alternatively, the ground engaging means may be wheels preferably, the ground engaging means is swivellable relative to the locking and locating device. i have found that when the ground engaging means is in the form of the plurality of rollers, the weight of the containers when supported by the wheel means, is better distributed and causes less fatigue in the wheel means. hence, this embodiment is more suitable for moving heavy containers. preferably, the locking and locating device is a lug, the wheel means having means for securing the lug in the underside aperture of a container, which securing means is arranged to be inserted in a side or end corner of a container to engage with the lug. alternatively, the locating and locking device may comprise a locating and locking plate which are rotatable relative to one another for engagement within the underside aperture of the container. in accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for unloading containers from transporters so that the unloaded containers can be moved, which comprises releasably mounting wheels in side apertures adjacent each corner of the container on a transporter, backing the container and transporter towards
