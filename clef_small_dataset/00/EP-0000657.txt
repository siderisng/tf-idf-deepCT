<ABSTRACT>
a labelling machine has a push button switch (20), actuation  of which causes a label to be printed by a thermographic  printing head (6) with selected data which has been  stored in a microprocessor by operation of a keyboard (19).   the printed label is fed by an electrically powered drive  mechanism (9, 10) controlled by the microprocessor to a dispensing  position from which the label can be applied to an  article and a further label is advanced from a supply to the  printing head (6).  the label supply is a continuous strip (5) of  separated labels with self-adhesive covered by a backing  strip (14) which is peeled away as the printed label reaches  the dispensing position.  spaced optically or magnetically  detectable markings on the label strip are detected in the  machine to provide signals to the microprocessor for obtaining  registration of each label with the printing head (6).
