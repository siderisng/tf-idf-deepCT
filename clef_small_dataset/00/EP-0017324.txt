<ABSTRACT>
a surge voltage arrester utilizes for surge protection a  varistor (16) of the zinc oxide type between a line terminal  (4,40) and a ground terminal (6,60).  the varistor is of a type  that has a resistance which decreases as increasing voltage  is applied thereacross.  with increasing temperature the  leakage current through the varistor increases at a given  voltage.  at a critical temperature and voltage condition, the  varistor is subject to a thermal runaway condition which  would cause the varistor to fail expelling hot particles.  to  avoid this failure condition, a fail-safe mechanism (34,26,30)  is provided which connects the line terminal to the ground  terminal by-passing the varistor when there is an over-Â­ current condition on the line that results in heating of the  varistor.
