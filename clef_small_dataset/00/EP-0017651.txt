<ABSTRACT>
a method of producing amines, the method compris­ ing contacting at reactive conditions at least one alcohol,  aldehyde or ketone, or a mixture thereof, with an aminating  agent in the presence of a catalyst, is improved by employ­ ing as the catalyst a compositon comprising cobalt, or  nickel, copper and a third component selected from the  group consisting of iron, zinc, zirconium and mixtures  thereof.  for example, polypropylene glycol is quantitatively  aminated by contacting it with ammonia at about 175° c and  in the presence of a catalyst comprising (metal basis) 30  mole percent cobalt, 63 mole percent copper and about 7  mole percent iron.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved method of producing amines from alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and mixtures thereof all) caftltst us this invention relates to an improved method of producing amines from alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and mixtures thereof. in one aspect, the invention relates to an ammonolytic method while in another aspect it relates to a catalyst useful therein. the prior art describes numerous catalysts useful for the ammonolysis of an alcohol, and particularly primary and secondary alcohols, to the corresponding amine. shirley and speranza, u.s. patent 3,128,311, teach a catalyst comprising about 50 to 90 weight percent nickel, about 10 to 50 weight percent copper and about 0.5 to 5 weight percent of an oxide selected from the class consisting of chromium oxide, titanium oxide, thorium oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide and manganese oxide. moss, u.s. patent 3,152,998, teaches a catalyst characterized by having the composition calculated in mole percent on an oxide-free basis of 60 to 85 percent nickel, 14 to 37 percent copper and 1 to 5 percent chromium. while these and other catalysts have demonstrated ammonolytic utility, catalysts demonstrating superior ammonolytic activity are desirable for reasons of economy, efficiency and convenience. the present invention is a method for preparing amines by contacting an alcohol, aldehyde or ketone with an aminating agent in the presence of a catalyst, where the catalyst is composed of nickel or cobalt, copper and iron, zinc or zirconium, characterized in that the catalyst comprises, calculated in mole percent and on an oxide-free basis: (a) 20 to 90 percent cobalt and 8 to 72 percent copper, or 20 to 49 percent nickel and 36 to 79 percent copper, and (buzz 1 to 16 percent iron, zinc or zirconium. the present invention also includes a catalyst for preparing amines from at least one alcohol, aldehyde or ketone, or a mixture thereof, the catalyst consisting of, calculated in mole percent and on an oxide-free basis: (a) 20 to 90 percent cobalt; (b) 8 to 72 percent copper; and (c) 1 to 16 percent of iron, zinc or zirconium. the present invention also includes a catalyst for preparing amines from at least one alcohol, aldehyde or ketone, or a mixture thereof, the catalyst consisting of, calculated in mole percent and on an oxide-free basis: (a) 20 to 49 percent nickel; (b) 36 to 79 percent copper; and (c) 1 to 16 percent of iron, zinc or zirconium. these compositions demonstrate superior annonolytic activity thus allowing quantitative conversion of the alcohol to the corresponding amine at less rigorous method conditions. moreover, these compositions demonstrate excellent selectivity and life. the ammonolytic mechanism of this invention is believed to comprise: (a) dehydrogenating the alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone; (b) adding the aminating agent to the aldehyde or ketone to form an imine; and (c) hydrogenating the imine to the corresponding amine. consequently, the catalytic compositions of this invention are also useful for the ammonolysis of aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding amines. the preferred compositions of the present invention are those comprising, in
