<DESCRIPTION>
rotary compressor this invention relates particularly to a rotary compressor capable of compressing air and a variety of gases, mixtures, vapors and refrigerants. the rotary compressor of this invention has a stationary housing and piston and cylinder-piston elements rotatable in relation to the housing and journaled on eccentric portions of two oppositely rotatable shafts. the piston and cylinder-piston elements form moveable walls and axially spaced stationary walls of the housing form stationary walls of at least one compression chamber. fluid can be drawn into the compression chamber through intake ports or intake valves, and is discharged through discharge valves. reciprocating piston compressors are well known in the art. they possess, however, inherent disadvantages of having reciprocating motion of a piston causing high stresses in certain components, vibration, noise, and limiting their speeds. due to speed limitations, the reciprocating compressors are relatively bulky and heavy machines. further, they must be equipped with suction valves complicating their design, lowering efficiency and causing other numerous disadvantages. various types of rotary compressors have been proposed to replace the reciprocating piston compressor in order to overcome some of its disadvantages, and to realize new advantages. however, such efforts have not been fully successful and the reciprocating piston compressor continues to be in widespread use today. summary of the invention the rotary compressor of this invention comprises generally an outer housing within which one or more rotatable piston and cylinder-piston elements are re received the housing comprises at least two axially spaced walls, and the piston and cylinder-piston are operatively positioned between and adjacent to them. the piston and cylinder-piston are journaled on eccentric portions of two shafts. the shafts can be journaled in axially spaced walls of the housing and are interconnected by gearing means to transmit power from a drive shaft to a driven shaft and to coordinate their movements in such a way so the shafts rotate in coordinated rotations in opposite directions and with equal rotational speeds. the piston and cylinder-piston follow coordinated planetary movements in opposite directions with and about the eccentric portions of their shafts and form moveable walls of at least one compression chamber, whereas the stationary walls of the compression chamber are formed by the axially spaced walls of the housing. - intake charge of fluid compressed by one version of the compressor of this invention can be drawn into the compression chamber or chambers through suitable intake port or ports sequentially opened and closed by the cylinder-piston and piston elements. in another version, the intake charge can be drawn into compression chamber or chambers through suitable intake valve or valves. the compressed fluid is discharged from the compression chamber through suitable discharge valve or valves. internal leakage between the piston and cylinderpiston, and between the piston and cylinder-piston and adjacent space walls of the housing can be controlled through use of a sealing system comprising sealing elements received within grooves of the piston and cylinder-piston and sealingly engaged with co-working surfaces of the cylinder-piston and axially spaced
