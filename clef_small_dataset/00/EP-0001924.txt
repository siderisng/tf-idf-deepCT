<ABSTRACT>
a pharmaceutical composition comprises choline, or a  natural or synthetic compound that dissociates to form  choline, and a drug and is administered to a patient in order  to potentiate the effect of the drug by increasing acetylcholine  levels in the brain or other tissues, and/or to suppress, or  block the development of, unwanted side-effects of the drug,  by increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain or other  tissues.  suitable choline precursors are lecithin and choline  chloride.  the composition is effective in suppresing tardive  dyskinesia when used to administer anti-psychotic drugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
pharmaceutical composition for administering cholinethis invention relates to the use of lecithin or lecithin analogs for the manufacture of medicaments. these compositions are provided for the administration of a drug with lecithin or lecithin analogs which dissociate to form choline in order to increase acethylcholine levels in brain and other tissues and alleviate human disorders arising as side-effects of the antipsychotic drug as it is specified below in move detail. there are a number of diseases which affect acetylcholine-containing neurons in the brain or other tissues, and which are treated by drugs that cause undesired side effects by diminishing acetylcholine release; there also exist diseases now treated by other drugs in which the potency and/or efficiency of the drugs could be improved by combining them with choline or natural or synthetic compounds that dissociate to form choline in order thereby to enhance the release of acetylcholine. such diseases include both those primarily involving the brain (e.g. diseases of higher cortical functions; psychiatric illnesses; movement disorders) and those involving the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuromuscular disorders). tardive dyskinesia is a particularly common movement disorder associated with inadequate release of brain acetylcholine as a result of drug administration for the initial brain disease (e.g. psychosis). tardive dyskinesia is a choreic movement disorder characterized by involuntary twitches in the tongue, lips, jaw and extremities. it typically occurs in susceptible persons after chronic injestion of neuroleptic drugs and may involve an imbalance in the postulated reciprocal relation between dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the basal ganglions. thus, drugs that either block catecholamine synthesis (e.g. alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine), deplete the brain of monoamines (e.g. reserpine, tetrabenazine) or antagonize dopamine's actions on synaptic receptors (e.g. pherothiazines, haloperidol) often suppress tardive dyskinesia, whereas drugs that indirectly stimulate dopamine receptors (e.g. amphetamine, levodopa) often exacerbate the abnormal movements. drugs assumed to increase the amount of acetylcholine within brain synapses (e.g. physostigmine, deanol), also tend to suppress the chorea of tardive dyskinesia, whereas anticholinergics (e.g. scopolamine), make it worse. it has been shown that choline administered by injection or by dietary supplementation increases blood choline levels in the rat; (cohen et al life sci., vol. 16, 1095-1102, 1975 and science vol. 191, 561-562, 1976), this, in turn, increases choline levels in cholinergic neurons within the brain and elsewhere in the body, thereby accelerating the synthesis of acetylcholine, increasing tissue acetylcholine levels, and increasing the amounts of acetylcholine released into brain synapses. in human beings, oral doses of choline were found to cause dose-related increases in blood choline levels of sufficient magnitude (based on the studies on rats) to enhance brain acetylcholine synthesis and release; choline levels in the cerebrospinal fluid also rose in parallel (growdon et al., j. neurochem vol. 28, 229-231, 1977). it has also been reported (davis et al. life sciences, vol. 19, 1507-1516, 1976) in four human patients that the administration of choline decreased the choreiform movements of tardive dyskinesia; no data were provided as to whether or not the drug given concurrently for psychosis (haloperidol, 3 mg
