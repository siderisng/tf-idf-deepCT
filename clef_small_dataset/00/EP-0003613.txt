<ABSTRACT>
a valve has annular metal seats (26, 28) mounted  in seat pockets (18, 20) around the inlet and outlet passage-ways  (12, 14) at the valve chamber (16).  each of the seat  members has a front face which includes an outer seal  surface (36, 36a) around the outer perimeter of the seat  and a flexible annular metal lip (38, 38a) around the inner  perimeter of the seat.  the lip has an inner seal surface  (40, 40a) on its free end in spaced concentric relation to the  outer seal surface (36, 36a) and maintains a fluid-tight  seal with the closing member or gate (22, 24) while deflecting  to compensate for deformations of the valve body  (10) that would otherwise affect the seal.  the inner  peripheral surface of the seat has an annular groove (44)  which defines the back surface (48) of the lip (38, 38a)  which tapers from the base to the free extending end  thereof.  each of the seat members (26, 28) has a back face  which rests in contact with the outer peripheral portion  of the bottom (32) of the associated seat pocket (18, 20).   the seat member (26, 28) preferably has an annular  flexible member (62) extending from its back face which  may be welded to the valve body (10).  the flexible lip  (38, 38a) and flexible member (62) deform to compensate  for deformations of the valve body (10) so the seat can  maintain sealing contact with the gate (22, 24) when the  valve is in the opened and the closed positions.
