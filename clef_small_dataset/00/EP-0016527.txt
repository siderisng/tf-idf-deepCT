<ABSTRACT>
an impact press (20) includes drive means for reciprocat­ ing a sleeve (50) at one end of which a ram (55) is slidably and  rotatably carried, the same being normally held in a retracted  position by retaining means (59).  the drive means that recip­ rocates the sleeve (50) toward and away from impact tooling  (22) also regulates in synchronization therewith a releasing  means (66-76) by which the retaining means (59) lets go of the  ram (55) to permit it to fly under the influence of a bias until it  impacts the tooling (22).  reaction from the tooling (22) after  the punching has been completed provides a force for receiv­ ing the ram (55) in the sleeve (50).  if desired, the driving means  can also be used to regulate the operation of a workpiece  feeder (24), a workpiece brake (25), and any regulator (94) that  the impact tooling (22) may have all in synchronization with  the movements of the sleeve (50).  if a conventional air feeder  (24) is used, owing to limitations of the feeder (24), the device  can be operated at 180 strokes per minute.  without such  feeder (24) smaller workpieces can be made or modified at the  rate of 500 strokes per minute.
