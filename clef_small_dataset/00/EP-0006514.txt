<ABSTRACT>
a stator assembly in which a stack (52, 54) of stator  laminations form a stator core.  the laminations are shaped  to form a plurality of poles (14) projecting radially inwardly  with arcuate undercut slots (18) between the poles (14).   the laminations are held together by a plurality of molded  tubular insulator members (26, 28), each comprising male  (26) and female (28) sections inserted from opposite direc­ tions into the slots (18) and joining together telescopically  within the slots (18).  each end of the tubular member sec­ tions (26, 28) have integral flanges (42) which engage the  ends of the poles (14) between the slots (18).  the tubular  members are split lengthwise and compressed to insert  them in the slots (18).  once inserted, the tubular members  expand within the slots (18) to grip the edges of the lamina­ tions and hold the stack (52, 54) together and in alignment.   the stator coils extend through the tubular members (26,  28) within the slots (18), the member (26, 28) providing  insulation between the coils and the core.
