<ABSTRACT>
A device for dry development of lighting pump material by gas or vaporous developing media consists of a developing chamber (5) with a transport device (6) arranged therein (6) for the light-up material (4). In this case, the developing chamber (5) each is a shield chamber (8 or 10) forward and downstream. So that no development medium can escape into the ambient air and cause odor nuisances, special precautions have been made. Both shielding chambers (8 and 10) are limited in their developing chamber (5) passed through line for the light-pump material (4) by a plurality of in the distance between the spaced, stationary adjusted screen surfaces (11 and 12). Their spaces (8 ', 8 "or 10', 10") are associated with suction chambers (13 and 14). In addition, a degassing chamber (16) is followed against the developing chamber (5) downstream shield chamber (10), in which another transport device (17) for the light-pump material (4) is arranged. Since no moving parts come into contact with the ambient air, no development medium can be transported to the outside.
