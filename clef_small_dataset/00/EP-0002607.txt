<ABSTRACT>
a device is disclosed for implanting a pacemaker  electrode within a patient with a minimal amount of incision.   the device comprises an introducer sleeve 56 which is  severed or is severable along the length thereof.  the sleeve  is insertable into the subclavian vein through a prior incision  made by needle.  the introducer sleeve may be introduced  through the needle or on the outer surface of a needle, or  through the use of a guide wire passed through the internal  portion of the needle after the needle is removed.  the  electrode tip 42 is inserted through the introducer sleeve to  enter the vein 16 of the patient.  the introducer sleeve is  withdrawn from the patient while the electrode lead 20 is  moved through a cut or line of weakness 64 in the sleeve wall  along the entire length thereof to remove the sleeve over the  connector plug 30 of the electrode.
