<ABSTRACT>
a semiconductor integrated circuit includes an upward  mode (13, 19a, 17c) and a downward mode (34, 25, 17d, 14)  vertical transistor, both of the same polarity (npn).  the impu­ rity concentrations in the base zones of both transistors are  graded, decreasing towards the collector.  a laterial transistor  (21, 17b, 22) can be merged with the upward mode transistor  to provide an i²l element and local oxide regions (36-40) can  be provided for isolation by low temperature, high pressure  oxidation so as to cause substantially no movement or segre­ gation of impurities.

<DESCRIPTION>
"semiconductor integrated circuit and fabrication methods this invention relates to semiconductor inte#ated circuits including a plurality of bipolar transistors. tranristorss in integrated circuits conventionally are fabricated for optimum operation in the downward mode because the diffusion of impurities is downward fros the top surface so that impurity concentration gradients thus produced enhance the performance of transistors operated in the downward lode. these transistors are referred to as downward transistors0 conventionally the base zone is fomed by impurity introduction followed by a similar process for forming the emitter zone. generally this enables sone control over the width of the base zone, an important factor in transistor switching speed. moreover, the emitter zone is usually the smallest zone of the transistor and thus usually has the least parasitic capacitance'. in circuit canfigurations in yhich the collector is connected to a fixed voltage node, the smaller emitter advantageously is connected to a varying node so as to reduce the power required to switch the transistor. however, there are integrated circuit configurations in which the emitter is connected to a fixed voltage node and it would be desirable to have a small collector region to connect to the varying node. in integrated injection logic, also termed merged transistor logic, the switching transistor is operated in the upward node. circuits have been proposed providing other fores of logic on the same chip with injection logic. these considerations suggest the desirability of providing within one semiconductor integrated circuit chip, transistor configurations suitable for operating in both the downward and upward node and ihich also mag include lateral transistors suitable for merged transistor logic structures. upward mode transistors having up-ditfused base zones are knawn, as disclosed, for example, in u.8. patent 4,101,349. the upward node transistor tt this disclosure primarily is of the junction isolated type which is generally accompanied by high parasitic effects, particularly capacitances. moreover, for transistors with suitable analog capability, a higher degree of isolation, such as is provided by local oxide regions, is desirable. although briefly suggested in the above-noted reference, the form of oxide isolation thus disclosed involves certain disadvantages. in particular, isolation regions of silicon oxide are formed by thermal oxidation of silicon semiconductor material. insofar as applicants are aware, the practice heretofore has been to perform such oxidation at relatively high temperatures. this appears to have several disadvantages. if done subsequent to impurity implantation and diffusion, the thermal oxidation tenperature tends to move the precisely placed pe junctions and to change impurity concentration gradients. the growth of silicon oxide at high tenperature also causes an impurity segregation in semiconductor material adjoining the oxide rendering the adjoining zones susceptible to conductivity type inversion. conduction channels sting from such inversion are countered by channel stops requiring additional fabrication steps. u.s. patent 4,087,900 to a #. iannoulos discloses an injection logic configuration in a semiconductor chip which also includes downward node transistors. however, the upward mode transistor is the injector rather than the switching transistor and is of the opposite conductivity type and
