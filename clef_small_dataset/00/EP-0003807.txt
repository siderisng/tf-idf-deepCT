<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for producing a curved sail. In the usual production of sailing, a variety of sources of error when indicating, cutting, assembling and known in gluing or welding is known, especially if the sails arched in their final state, so be provided with a stomach. Such sails are hitherto been assembled on a flat bottom surface, for example on a zipper or a cutting table. In view of these conditions, the inventor has set the goal of creating a method and apparatus of the type mentioned, with which the prior art defects are avoided, and which allow it to produce complicated sailing blanks not only in a simple manner, but also one Cost-effective adjustment of the sails to offer the very different wishes of the customers. In order to solve this object, a working surface reproducing the end shape of the sailing is set, on these sailing webs are placed, then tailored and connected to each other in the preselected sail form, then the size of the sailing is indicated and tailored by means of adjustable lines. For this purpose, one of the final shape of the sail adaptably formed formed formed working surface is provided, which is advantageously formed by a molded sheet; This is bendable from an approximately planes normal position to form a convex and / or concave work surface.
