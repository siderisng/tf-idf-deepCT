<ABSTRACT>
n-substituted benzothiazolines have been found to be  effective herbicides and plant growth regulants.  said benzothiazolines  are substituted with thiol esters and are compounds  characterized in that they have the formula    wherein r is selected from alkyl having from one to five  carbon atoms; alkenyl having from one to five carbon atoms;  hydroxyalkyl having from one to five carbon atoms; haloalkyl  having from one to five carbon atoms; haloalkenyl having  from one to five carbon atoms; benzyl, quinolyl, and    wherein r₁ and r₂ are independently selected from hydrogen  and halo; r₃ is selected from hydrogen, halo, amino, nitro,  trifuloromethyl, alkyl having from one to five carbon atoms,  alkoxy having from one to five carbon atoms, phthalimido and  coor₄; wherein r₄ is hydrogen or alkyl having from one to  five carbon atoms; x is halo, and n is zero or one.
