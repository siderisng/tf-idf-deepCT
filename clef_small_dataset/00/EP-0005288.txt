<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to new derivatives of 1-amino-fluoren-9-one  and their use as herbicides.  the new compounds may be represented by the formula:    in which r₁ and r₂, which may be identical or different,  represent a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkane-carbonyl,  alkenyl or alkynyl radical, which may be substituted  by a halogen atom and may also form with the attached  nitrogen atom a heterocyclic ring, whereas one or two  of the symbols r₁ and r₂ represent hydrogen, x and x′, which  may be identical or different, represent hydrogen, a halogen  atom, a trihalogenomethyl radical or a trifluoromethylsulfonyl  (cf₃so₂) radical, with the proviso that x and x′ do not  each represent hydrogen, and y and y′, which may be  identical or different, represent hydrogen or a nitro radical.

<DESCRIPTION>
derivatives of 1-amino-fluoren-9-one and their use as herbicides this invention relates to new derivatives of 1-nmino- fluoren-9-one and to the preparation thereof. it also relates to new preemergence herbicidal compositions containing at least one new derivative of 1-aminofluoren-9-one. the new derivatives of 1-amino-fluoren-9-one of the present invention may be represented by the following formula emi1.1 in which r1 and r2 which may be identical or different, represent a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical which may be substituted by a halogen atom and may also form with the attached nitrogen atom a heterocyclic ring, whereas one or two of the symbols r1 and r2 may also represent hydrogen, x and x' which may be identical or different represent hydrogen, a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or fluorine, a trihalogenomethyl radical, such as trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl or tribromomethyl radical, or a trifluoromethylsulfonyl (cf2s02) radical, with the proviso that x and x' do not each represent hydrogen and y and y' which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a nitro radical. this invention relates particularly to new derivatives of 1-amino-fluoren-9-one in which r1 and r2, which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl radical and x and x' which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a halogen atom, with the proviso that x and x do not each represent hydrogen and y as well as y' represent hydrogen. among the new derivatives of 1-amino-fluoren-9-one of formula i, the following may be cited by way of examples, other compounds according to this invention being described in examples 5 to 37 - i -dimethylamino-2-fluoro-fluoren-9-one - 1-amino-2-fluoro-fluoren-9-one - i -dimethylamino-4-fluoro-fluoren-9-one - 1 methylamino-4-fluoro-fluoren-9-one - 1 -amino-4-fluoro-fluoren-9-one - 1 -dimethylamino-7-fluoro-fluoren-9-one. the compounds according to this invention may be prepared as follows. when, in the formula i, r1 and r2 represent an alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical,the compounds of formula i may be prepared by reacting a 1-amino-fluoren-9-one of the following formula emi2.1 in which x, x', y and y' have the above meanings, with an alkylating, alkanoylating, carbalcoxylating, cycloalkanecarbonylating, alkenylating or alkynylating reagent. for example, when it is desired to obtain a compound of formula i, in which r1 and r2 represent the same alkyl radical,whereas x, x', y and y' have the above meanings, the compound of formula ii may be reacted with an alkyl p-toluene sulfonate or a dialkyl sulfate. when, in the compounds of formula i, r1 represents hydrogen and r2 represents a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical, the compounds of formula i may also be prepared by reacting a compound of the following formula emi3.1 in which r2 represents a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical, x, x', y and y' have one of the above meanings and a represents an alkanoyl group such as an acetyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl or carbalcoxy or cycloalkanecarbonyl group or a toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) group, with sulfuric acid. it has been found that the compounds of
