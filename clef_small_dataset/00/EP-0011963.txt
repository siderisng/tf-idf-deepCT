<ABSTRACT>
a compound, with hypolgycaemic activity, having for­ mula (ii) or a pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary  ammonium or acid addition salt thereof:    wherein x represents oxygen or sulphur;   n represents zero or 1;   r⁷ represents hydrogen or c₁₋₆-alkyl;   r¹ and r² are the same or different and represent hydrogen,   c₁₋₆ alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, or c₃₋₆ cycloalkyl;   r³ represents hydrogen, c₁₋₆ alkyl, phenyl or benzyl;   r⁴ represents hydrogen or c₁₋₆ alkyl;   r⁵ represents c₁₋₆ alkyl, phenyl optionally substituted with up  to 3 groups selected from halogen, c₁₋₆ alkyl, and c₁₋₆ alkoxy;   or benzyl optionally substituted with up to 3 groups selected  from halogen, c₁₋₆ and c₁₋₆alkoxy; or r⁴ and r⁵ together  represent the remaining members of a 5-or 6-membered ring  optionally containing an oxygen, sulphur or additional nit­ rogen atom and being optionally substituted with c₁₋₆ alkyl,  carboxy or c₁₋₆ alkoxycarbonyl; and   r⁶ represents phenyl, optionally substituted with up to 3  groups selected from halogen, c₁₋₆ alkyl, c₁₋₆ alkoxy, c₁₋₆  alkanoyl, c₁₋₆ alkanoyloxy, nitro, hydroxy, amino, substituted  amino, carboxy, and c₁₋₆ alkoxycarbonyl.
