<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a photo wall with a tripod (1), relative to which the housing (6) receiving a two-sided coated optical wall (6) receiving housing (5) is rotatable from a vertical rest position into a horizontal use position, wherein two different uses are provided, in one of which an outlet slot (7) In the housing (5) on the upper side and one of the two projection surfaces from the tripod (1) away from the housing (5) can be pulled out. In order to easily spend the housing (5) in such a photo wall, and to avoid damage to the cloth (6), it is proposed that the holder (4) of two by means of a pivoting movement parallel to the housing (5) existing joint bonded parts (12, 13), the first part (12) is firmly connected to the housing and whose second part (13) is rotatably mounted by a horizontal axis (9) on the tripod (1), and that the two parts (12, 13) The holder (4) via a transmission (19, 20) are coupled motionally coupled together, the first part (12) in a position when rotating the housing (5) from the vertical rest position in one of the two horizontal use positions in a position pivots, in which the outlet slot (7) of the housing (5) faces upwards.
