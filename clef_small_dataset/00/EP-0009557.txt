<ABSTRACT>
Process for simultaneously coding two bit sequences in a single pulse sequence.Several binary signals are multiplexed in time using the RG1 and SER registers to generate a first bit sequence L applied to an encoder 10 which also receives a second bit sequence D and clock information CP.Each pair of bits L and D is coded as follows.When bit l is at a first binary level, the pair is coded in bipolar signal;In the other case, the pair is coded into a biphase signal.Application to interface circuits for data transmission.
