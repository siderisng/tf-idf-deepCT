<ABSTRACT>
ethylene copolymers having a density of about 0. 91 to  0. 94 and a melt flow ratio of about >26 to <40 are readily  produced in a low pressure gas phase process at a productiv­ ity of ≧500,000 pounds of polymer per pound of ti with a  catalyst formed from selected organo aluminium compounds  and a composition prepared by copulverizing magnesium  dihalide with a complex obtained by contacting a titanium  compound of the structure ti(or)axb with an ether, ester,  ketone or amine,   wherein r is a c₁ to c₁₄ aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon  radical, or cor′ where r′ is a c₁ to c₁₄ aliphatic or aromatic  hydrocarbon radical,   x is cl, br, i or mixtures thereof, a is 0 or 1, b is 2 to 4  inclusive and a + b = 3 or 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to the catalytic copolymerization of ethylene with high activity mg and ti containing complex catalysts in a low pressure gas phase. process to produce polymers having a density of about 0.91 to 0.94 and a melt flow ratio of about > 26 to #40. to be commercially useful in a gas phase process, such as the fluid bed processes of u.s. patents '3,709,853; 4,003,712 and 4,011,382; canadian patent 991,798 and belgian patent 839,380, the catalyst employed must be a high activity catalyst, that is, it must have a level of productivity of 50,000 and preferably, > 100,000 pounds of polymer per pound of primary metal in the catalyst. this is so because such gas phase processes usually do not employ any catalyst residue removing procedures. thus, the catalyst residue in the polymer must be so small that it can be left in the polymer without causing any undue problems to either the resin manufacturer, or to a party fabricating articles from the resin, or to an ultimate user of such fabricated articles. where a high activity catalyst is successfully used in such fluid bed processes, the heavy metal content of the resin is of the order of (20 parts per million (ppm) of primary metal at a productivity level of > 50,000. low catalyst residue contents are also important where the catalyst is made with chlorine containing materials such as the titanium, magnesium and/or aluminum chlorides used in some so-called ziegler or ziegler-natta type catalysts. high residual chlorine values in a molding resin will cause pitting and corrosion on the metal surfaces of the molding devices. molding resins having cl residues of the order of > 200 ppm are not commercially useful. british patent 1,310,547, published in march 1973, describes the preparation of high density ( > 0.96 g/cc) ethylene homopolymers or copolymers with a supported catalyst. this catalyst is a reaction product of a product prepared by grinding together (preferably in a ball mill) either (i) a magnesium halide and a titanium addition compound, or (ii) a polyvalent titanium compound, an electron donor compound and an organometallic compound or hydride of a group i to iii metal, such as aluminum. the examples of this patent describe the preparation of the homopolymers and copolymers in a slurry process. u.s. patent 3,888,835, which issued in june 1975, describes the homopolymerization or copolymerization of ethylene in a slurry process at high temperatures in the presence of a catalyst consisting of (a) a co-comminuted (ball-milled) composition of a titanium halide, an aluminum halide-ether complex and a magnesium halide, and (b) an organoaluminum compound,. the polymerization activity of this catalyst is described as very high. another advantage described in this patent, of using such catalyst, is that the aluminum halide-ether complex used in the catalyst preparation is soluble in hydrocarbon solvents and is removed from the polymer product by filtration. u.s. patent 3,991,260, which issued in november 1976, describes the homopolymerization or copolymerization of ethylene in the presence of a catalyst
