<ABSTRACT>
tie means employable for purposes of accomplishing  the tying together of tubes of a superheater platen assembly.   the subject tie means is particularly suited for use in those  applications wherein a need exists to effect the tying  together of tubes, which bear a tangential relationship to  each other.  the subject tie means comprises a multiplicity of  cooperating tie members that are suitably affixed such as by  being welded thereto, to the pair of tubes that the tie means  is intended to tie together.  more specifically, the multiplicity  of tie members includes a pair of tie members (26,28 that is  affixed to a first one of the pair of tubes and a second pair of  tie members (30,32) that is affixed to the second one of the  pair of tubes.  each of the multiplicity of tie members is  essentially l-shaped in configuration with the first pair of tie  members (26,28) being oriented so as to each have a portion  (26a,28a) thereof, which projects inwardly, while a second  pair of tie members (30,32) is oriented so that each of the tie  members has a portion (30a,32a) thereof, which projects  outwardly, whereby the inwardly projecting portions  (26a,28a) of the first pair of tie members are supported in  sliding engagement with the outwardly projecting portions  (30a,32a) of the second pair of tie members thereby to effect  the tying together of the aforesaid pair of tubes through the  interengagement of the respective projecting portions of the  first and second pairs of tie members.
