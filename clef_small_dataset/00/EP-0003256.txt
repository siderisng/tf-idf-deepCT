<ABSTRACT>
a flexible tubular container having at least one end  gathered and bound by filamentary material (4) which is held  in position by adhesive material.  the container is advantageously made from a continuous  length of flexible tube by gathering and constricting  the tube (1) at spaced apart positions, winding filamentary  binding material along a portion of the constricted tube,  applying adhesive material to the binding material to fix the  binding material in position and cutting the bound portion of  the tube transversely (7) whereby a container sealed at each  end is defined and separated from the adjacent portions of  the flexible tube.  the preferred adhesive is cyanoacrylate  adhesive or hot-melt adhesive.
