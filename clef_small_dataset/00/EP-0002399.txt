<ABSTRACT>
1.  a disc brake for a vehicle, comprising at least one friction member (18, 20) of which the circumferential ends (42, 44) are slidably received and anchored by a torque absorbing member (10), operating means (28, 30) being associated with the latter to urge the friction member (18, 20) into braking contact with a corresponding side (22, 24) of a brake disc (12), at least a first one (42) of the circumferential ends (42, 44) of the friction member (18, 20) comprises at least one rounded surface (46) slidable on and capable of anchoring on a corresponding rounded surface (50) defined on the torque-absorbing member (10) one of the said rounded surfaces (50) being concave and the other rounded surface (46) bein convex, characterized in that the radius of curvature of convex surface (46) is smaller that the radius of curvature of the concave surface (50), said friction member being received with predetermined circumferential clearance (b) in the torque-absorbing member (10), so that the friction member (18, 20) can occupy a first and a second circumferential limit position corresponding to anchoring of the friction member (18, 20) on the torque-absorbing member (10) by way its first (42) or second (44) circumferential end respectively, depending on the direction of disc rotation, resilient means (54) being provided to urge the friction member (18, 20) away from the first circumferential limit position and into permanent contact with the rounded surface (50) defined on the torque-absorbing member (10).

1. a disc brake for a vehicle, comprising at least  one friction member (18) of which the circumferential  ends (42, 44) are slidably received and anchored by a  torque-absorbing member (10), operating means (28, 30) being  associated with the latter to urge the friction member  (18) into braking contact with a corresponding side  (22) of a disc brake (12), at least a first one (42) of  the circumferential ends (42, 44) of the friction member  (18) comprising at least one rounded surface (46)  slidable on and capable of anchoring on a corresponding  rounded surface (50) defined on the torque-absorbing member  (10), one of the said rounded surfaces (50) being concave  and the other rounded surface (46) being convex, the  radius of curvature of the convex surface (46) being  smaller than that of the concave surface (50), the said  friction member being received with predetermined circumferential  clearance (b) in the torque-absorbing member  (10), so that the friction member (18) can occupy a first  and a second circumferential limit position corresponding  to anchoring of the said friction member (18) on the  torque-absorbing member (10) by way of its first (42) or  second (44) circumferential end respectively, depending  on the direction of disc rotation, characterized in that  resilient means (54) creating a force defining a circumferential  and a radial component, perpendicular to the  latter, directed towards the axis of the disc (12), are  provided to urge at rest the said friction member (18) away from  the first circumferential limit position and into permanent  contact with the rounded surface (50) defined on  the torque-absorbing member (10), the said predetermined  clearance (b) being able to allow a sweeping of the rounded  surfaces in mutual contact. 2. a disc brake as claimed in claim 1, characterized  in that the second circumferential end (44) of the friction  member also cooperates by way of a rounded surface  (48) with a corresponding rounded surface (52) defined on  the torque-absorbing member (10), one of the said second  rounded surfaces (52) being concave and the other second     rounded surface (48) being convex and having a smaller  radius of curvature than the concave second surface (48). 3. a disc brake as claimed in either of the preceding  claims, characterized in that the concave surface  (50, 52) is formed on the torque-absorbing member (10) and  in that the convex surface (46, 48) is formed on the friction  member (18). 4. a disc brake as claimed in claims 3 and 2 combined,  in which the friction member (18) comprises a  backing plate (34) with which at least one pad of friction  material (38) is associated, the circumferential  ends (42, 44) of the friction member (18) being constituted  by extensions of the backing plate (34) which do  not bear friction material, characterized in that the  convex rounded surfaces (46, 48) are defined on the edges  of these extensions (42, 44). 5. a disc brake as claimed in claim 4, characterized  in that the resilient means (54) comprise at least one  hire spring associated with the extension (42) of the  friction member (18) corresponding to the first circumferential  end and capable of bearing on the concave surface  (50) so as to generate the said force defining the  circumferential component and the radial component, perpendicular  to the latter and directed towards the disc  (12) axis. 6. a disc brake as claimed in claim 5, characterized  in that the spring (54) comprises a first arm (56) which  bears on one side of the backing plate (38) and of which  the two ends are bent at right angles to engage the edges  of the said plate (38) at the base of the corresponding  extension (42), one of the said bent ends being extended  by a second arm (58) bearing on the other side of the  backing plate (38) and extending beyond a recess (60) in  the said extension (42), the free end of the second arm  (58) being bent substantially at right angles in the said  recess (60) to engage the front concave surface (50) defined  on the torque-absorbing member (10) and bent again  at right angles to bear on the first side of the backing     plate. 7. a disc brake as claimed in any one of the preceding  claims, characterized in that the said concave  (50, 52) and convex (46, 48) surfaces define two substantially  constant radii of curvature.
