<ABSTRACT>
a roller fitting which is adapted to be secured to a length  of scaffold tube and to suspend the scaffold tube from a girder.   the fitting comprises a main body (1), a clamp (4) pivotally  mounted on the main body (1), means (6,7) for releasably  holding the clamp (4) to the main body (1) and a roller (12)  rotatably mounted on part (11) of the main body (1) by means  of a bearing (13).  the clamp (4) and main body (1) are so  shaped that they can receive and hold between them a length  of scaffold tube (9) and the arrangement is such that, when the  fitting is located in position with the roller bearing on a flange  (17) of a girder, the said part (11) of the main body (1) on which  the roller (12) is mounted is located over the flange (17) of the  girder whereby, in the event of failure or breaking up of the  roller (12) or bearing (13), the said part (11) can engage the  flange (17) of the girder.
