<ABSTRACT>
1.  a film cassette comprising a frame having a bottom plate and an upper plate and located therebetween a pressure plate for resiliently bearing against said bottom plate when the cassette is in the closed position but raised therefrom when the cassette is in the open position, there being provided at one end of the frame a slot aperture for loading or unloading a film, said pressure plate having at least one lifting tab connected thereto along each side thereof, with two push rods being located one at each side of the frame for linear movement between a first position in which the cassette is closed and a second position in which the cassette is open, characterised in that there is assigned to each push rod (5) at least one round member (8) which can be moved thereby, said round member being located at a lifting tab (7) and resting in the first position of the push rod on one angle limb of a bellcrank member (9), said angle limb being positioned below at least one part of the lifting tab, such that the movement of the push rod from the first position into the second position causes the round member resting on the bellcrank member to move to the other angle limb thereof, whereby the angle limb initially parallel to the pressure plate is pivoted upwards, such that the lifting tab, and with it the pressure plate together with a light-shielding means (14) which prevents light from entering the cassette through the aperture (2) when the cassette is closed, is raised to open the cassette.
