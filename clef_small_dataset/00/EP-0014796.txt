<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to new rhodium compounds and a process ror producing the same. more particularly, it is concerned with new rhodium compounds having a structure iso electronic to erh(co)(pph3)3 and a process ror the selective production of the same. further, it relates to use of such products as catalysts in the oxo process. carzonyl tris (triphenylphosphine) rhodium hydride is knawn as a catalyst having activity in various chemical reactions xor organic syntheses, for example, in hydroformyla- tion. (japanese patent publication no. 10730/1970 equivalent to u.s. patent 3,527,809). see also u.s. patent 3,821,3l1 and canadian patent 992, 101. as rhodium compounds having a structure isoelectronic thereto are known carbonyl tris(triphenyl- phosphite) rhodium hydride hrh(co)(p(oph)3)3 (britisch patent no. 1338225), carnonyl tris (triphenylarsine) rhodium hydride hrh(co)(asph3)3 and carbonyl tris (triphenylarsite) rhodium hydride hrh(co) (as(oph)3)3 (british patent no. 1357735). as to producing these compounds, same processes are known. in the case of eth(co)(pph3)3, for example, there have been proposed (1) a process comprising reacting rhodium trichloride. t-;nydrate, excess triphenylphosphine, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde and sodium borohydride in boiling ethanol (journal of the chemical society (a), 1968, page 2660), (2) a process comprising reacting carbonyl bis (triphenylphosphite) rhodium# chloride, excess t-iphenyphosphine and sodium borohydride in boiling ethanol (ibid) and (3) a process comprising contacting carbonyl bis(triphenylphosphite) rhodium chloride and excess triphenylphosphine with synthesis gas (mixture of h2 and co) at a temnerature of at least 5oçc under a pressure of at least 10 atm. (jypanese patent publication no. 17572/1978). however, carbonyl tris(triphenylstibine) rhodium hydride hrh(co(sbph3)3 having a structure isoelctronic to the above described rhodium compounds has not beçn synthesized and isolated. moreover, as ns evident from the foregoing description, alt the rhodium compounds having the above described known structures contain respeotively a single kind of ligand and those containing different kinds of mixed ligands, for example, phosphines and arsines in the same mole- cule, are not known, although some monovalent rhodium compounds containing mixed ligands in the same molecule are known, for example, carbonyl triphenylphosphine triphenyl sine rhodium chloride rhcl(co)(pph3) (asph3) (journal of organometallic chemistry, vol. 43, no. 2, 197z, page 425), carbonyl triphenylphosphine triphenylstibine rhodium chloride rhcl(co)(pph3) (sbph3) (ibid), carbonyl triphenylarsine tri phenylstibine rhodium chloride rhcl(co)(asph3)(sbph3) (ibid) and carbonyl (diethylphenylphosphine) (tri-o-toluylstibine) rhodium chloride rhcl(co)(pphet2) (sb(o-ch2c6h4)3) (inorganic chemistry, vol. 15, no. 13, 1976, page 646,. see also j. chem. soc. d1970, (17), 1077-8 (england); inorg. nucl. chem. lett. 1971, 7(9)877-9 (england); j. chew. soc. dalton trans. 1972 (19) 2161-9 (england) and u.s. patent 3,459,780. as a method for synthesizing these compounds, it has been proposed to add to a binuclear rhodium compound (r+scl(co)l)2 wherein l is triphenylphosphine, triphenylsrsine or triphenylstibine in warn benzene an ether solution of 2 mols (equimolar amount) of l' being triphenylphosphine, triphenylsrsine or triphenylstibine but not the s me as l (journal of organometallic chemestry, vol. 43, no. 2, 1972, page 425). other references of lesser interest, noted because they concern rhodium-containing compounds, are u.s. patents 3,939,188 and 3,946,082, which relate to compounds containing reduced, zero valent rhodium and
