<ABSTRACT>
a method of constructing a chassis member comprises  the provision of a first metal plate or strip like member (11)  with a plurality of apertures (12) therethrough.  a plurality of  reinforcing members (13) are welded to one face of a second  metal plate or strip like member (10) in positions such that  when the first plate (11) is positioned above the second plate  (10) the reinforcing members (13) each overlap the edge of an  aperture in the first plate.  the first plate (11) is welded to the  reinforcing members (13) at the edge of the apertures (12).   the invention also includes a chassis beam of such construction.   although the invention is not restricted in application to a  particular field it is particularly suitable for trailer necks of  heavy goods trailers such as are connectible to tractor vehicles  by a so called fifth wheel coupling.
