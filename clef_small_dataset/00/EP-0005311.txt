<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for regulating the power supplied  to an electrical load with the degeneration of the  voltage from a power source such as a battery.  the regulating  circuit (11, 14, 15, 16) maintains a constant luminous  flux output from a lamp (17) over a substantial range of  voltages by switching the voltage to the lamp on and off  at a preselected and controlled duty cycle.  the principal  advantage of this regulation is that only the minimum  energy necessary to produce a required minimum luminous  flux is used from the power source (12) irrespective  of its voltage value within the operative range.  the power  pulses applied to the lamp are of a voltage that varies  directly as the voltage variations of the power source and  widths that vary as the inverse square of the voltage from  the power source for maintaining a constant rms voltage  on the lamp and thereby constant light output flux.  the  oscillating signal generator (11) for providing the power  pulses is defined for sensing the power source output  voltage variations and generates a fixed frequency signal  having amplitudes varying between values directly related  to the power source output voltages.
