<ABSTRACT>
a radial grinding tool, preferably portable and hand-held.   grinding dust generated by contact between the  grinding face (2) and the work is drawn axially into the  mouths (10a, 11a) of ring-shaped cavities (10, 11), one to  each axial side of the wheel (1).  the chambers interconnect  by passages (30, 34, 28), and are connected to the suction  source (35, 36, 37).  the outer walls (8, 9) of the cavities are of  plastics or other wear-away material and spin with the  wheel, so that they wear by contact with the work as the  wheel wears likewise.
