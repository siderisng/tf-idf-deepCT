<ABSTRACT>
a novel apparatus for vertically conveying bulk materials  is provided which includes a vertical belt conveyor comprised  of two endless conveyor belts (25,26) guided to travel  upwardly along a substantially vertical plane in a face-to-face  overlapping relation to each other and a highspeed bulk projector  (52) for packing bulk material into between the opposing  faces of the two conveyor belts, utilizing the momemtum of  the bulk material per se.  the two conveyor belts are guided at  the bottom so as to turn round in directions opposite to each  other in substantially symmatrical fashion and bulk material is  projected rapidly under the effect of contrifugal force to the  bottom belt junction where the two conveyor belts come to  join each other.  the conveying apparatus, with its highspeed  bulk projector combined with a rotary bucket wheel type bulk  feeder, forms a vertical bulk delivering apparatus which is  compact and highly versatile.  in combination with an appropriate  movable support frame, the delivering apparatus is  advantageously usable as a delivering unit of a vertical bulk  delivering system for a bulk storing yard or for unloading bulk  cargo which is operable in the yard or cargo hold to deliver the  bulk cargo vertically upward with particular efficiency.
