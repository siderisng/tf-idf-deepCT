<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the manufacture of coated galvanized sheet metal or firewood on one or two faces, as well as a product obtained by means of this process.According to this method, it is determined according to the conditions of the environment or other the distance, relative to the surface of the bath (2) at which the temperature of the zinc coating on the sheet or the strip (3) is inThe range in which zinc passes through a liquid transient state which is characterized by its friability, and at this point a mechanical action (7.7 ', 7 ") on at least one of the surfaces of the sheetor the strip to completely tear down the totality of the unulated zinc, by leaving only a thin layer of iron-zinc alloy having a thickness of between 1 and 2 μm representing a quantity of alloy between 7 and 15g / m².
