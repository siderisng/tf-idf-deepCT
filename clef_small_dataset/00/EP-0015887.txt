<ABSTRACT>
an improved method for laundering fabrics to re­ move oily soil is disclosed, wherein fabrics are contacted  with a washing liquor comprising an aqueous solution of  a nonionic surfactant system and other ingredients.  the  washing temperature and ingredients of the washing  liquor are selected so that washing occurs at a tempera­ ture which is substantially above the cloud point of the  washing liquor and below the phase coalescence tem­ perature of the washing liquor.  compositions useful in  the practice of this invention are also disclosed, com­ prising a nonionic surfactant to which is added one or  more strong electrolytes.  such compositions may be di­ luted with water to form a washing liquor which has  cloud point and phase coalescence temperatures which  are tailored for washing, within the scope of the present  method, at a temperature preferred in the art.  conven­ tional sequestering detergency builders and adjuvants  may be added to the compositions as desired to opti­ mize the cleaning result.  the compositions may be  formulated to provide a washing liquor ph of less than  about 11 without diminishing the cleaning performance  of the washing liquor.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved laundering iethod and cotipositions technical field the area of technology pertaining to this invention is that of laundering fabrics, particularly in the context of commercial or industrial laundries which handle very heavy soil loads. the field of compositions useful for laundering fabrics to remove- oily soil is also dealt with herein. background art the prior art teaches that laundering processes may be conducted at a washing temperature roughly equal to the cloud point temperature of the washing liquor, but does not appear to suggest that washing should be carried out substantially above the cloud point temperature, yet below the phase coalescence temperature. for example, u.s. patent no. 3,707,506, issued to lozo on december 26, 1972, suggests at col. 1, lines 44-54, that there is some error in the prior art belief that maximum efficiency in removing dirt with a nonionic washing liquor is obtained at temperatures below the detergent cloud point the lozo reference does not provide any positive teachings however, as to what washing temperature may be selected to improve washing results. an article by cook entitled "versatility of nonionic detergents" published by soap and chemical specialities, may 1975, pages 47-49, indicates that a nonionic detergent works best if its surface active agent is not completely dissolved, but rather is partially in a colloidal state which promotes micelle formation. u.s. patent no. 3,925,224, issued to winston on december 9 1975, similarly teaches that a cloudy solution of a surfactant is optimal for laundering fabrics. it is believed that the cook and winston references essentially describe washing at the cloud point temperature of the washing liquor rather than at a temperature substantially above the cloud point temperature. two references have been found which provide teachings contrary to the present development, indicating that it is undesirable to wash at or above the cloud point temperature. these references are u.s. patent no. 3,890,238, issued to boehmer on june 17, 1975; and colwell et al., "considerations in the use of nonionic surface active agents," american dye stuff reporter, vol. 39, sept. 4, -191, page 679. british patent specification no. 1,518,676, naming mould et al. as inventors and published july 19, 1978, teaches washing substantially above the phase coalescence temperature 'of the washing liquor, but not withinthe temperature range between the cloud point and phase coalescence temperatures. the prior art teaches that it is known to add a strong electrolyte to an aqueous solution' containing a nonionic surfactant in order to lower the cloud point of the solution. for example, see schick, nonionic surfactants, parcel dekker, inc. (ny, 1966), library of congress cat. card no. 66-22492, especially pages 572-573. numerous prior art references can be found which generally indicate-that a nonionic detergent may be combined with a builder, a strong electrolyte, or mixtures thereof to form washing compositions. however, no such disclosures are known which reveal compositions having the relatively narrow ranges of proportions of strong electrolytes and builders which are necessary to realize the present improvement at specific temperatures which are typical
