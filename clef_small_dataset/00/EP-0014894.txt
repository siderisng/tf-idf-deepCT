<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for monitoring for faults in translucent strip  material, such as photographic film, comprises a transport  device 16, 12, 13, 22 for continuously moving the film 11 in its  longitudinal direction and an optical scanning device 23  including a beam divider 21 which divides a single series of  scanned light beams 14 into first and second sets of scanned  light beams 14a 14b.  the first set of light beams 14a is used to  carry out transmission measurements on the film as it passes  in tensioned condition between two spaced apart rollers 12,  13 and the second set 14b is used to carry out measurements  in remission or reflection as the film passes around the sur­ face of a roller 16.  the roller 16 has an air permeable surface  and air is blown through this surface from the inside of the  roller to form an air cushion between the film and the roller.  faults are detected by the electronic processing circuitry  18 in response to variations in the transmission and remission  measurements carried out by the light detectors 15 and 17.

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to an apparatus for monitoring for faults in transparent strip-like material and has particular reference to the detection of faults in photographic film. a monitoring apparatus is already known for this purpose and generally comprises a transport device for continuously moving a film in its longitudinal direction, an optical scanning device which generates a scanning light bead for scanning the film line by line point by point transversely of its direction of movement and a photoelectric light detecting arrangement including at least one light conducting rod for receiving light from the scanning light-bead as modified by the film. in apparatus of this kind it is necessary to monitor the film for faults both in transmission and also in remission or reflection. this can for example be achieved by guiding the film over a glass roller or a section of a glass cylinder and by projecting a scanning light beam which moves periodically to and fro onto the film in this region. a first light receiver arranged behind the scanning region can receive the transmitted light and a second light receiver arranged in front of the film can receive the remitted or reflected light and can detect faults which influence or affect the tranmitl-:d rc mitted or reflected light. an arrangement of this kind is, however, disadvantageous beczwse faults, which are not truly present, can be simulated if the glass roller or the section of a glass cylinder are dirty, by the formation of air bubbles between the film and the glass surface and if scratches are present on the glass surface. the principal object underlying the present invention is thus to provide a monitoring apparatus for monitoring for faults in film material which enables measurements to be taken both in transmission and also in remission or reflection without the two measurements mutually and unfavourably influencing one another. a further object of the.present invention is to keep the trouble and expense required to generate the scanning light bead at a very low level. further objects and aims of the present invention will become clear from the subsequent description and include the provision of'a simple and compact apparatus. for accomplishing the above objects the invention envisages apparatus for monitoring for faults in translucent strip material such as photographic film, the apparatus comprising a transport device for continuously moving the strip material in its longitudinal direction, an optical scanning device for projecting a series of light beams at the strip for line by line point by point scanning thereof in a direction transverse to its direction of movement and photoelectric detector means with at least one light con ducting rod for receiving light from said light beams after impingement of the light from said light beams.on the film and characterized in that the strip is forwarded in tensioned condition between two spaced apart rollers, that a first set of the light beams impinge on the strip substantially at right angles thereto in the region between said two rollers, that a
