<ABSTRACT>
a wear-resistant, iron-molybdenum boride alloy is dis­ closed as is a method of making it.  the alloy has a micros­ tructure comprising a primary boride phase and a matrix  phase.  the primary boride phase comprises molybdenum  alloyed with iron and boron, and the matrix phase comprises  one of iron-boron in iron and iron-molybdenum in iron and  has a hardness less than that of the primary boride phase.   the subject alloy generally has an average hardness level  above 1550 kg/mm² knoop to 500 gram load finds particular  utility in a composite material on a ground-engaging tool  such as a cutting edge or ripper tooth, and can also be used  for wear-resistant coatings, machine tool inserts, bearings,  and the like.
