<ABSTRACT>
To transfer data to the processing unit of a data processing plant, an external register field (25, 43) is provided, which has, for example, 8 rows of 8 registers each. Each register can z. b. Save a parity bit and eight data bits. Access to the field takes place to a whole line. A parity checker (33) is provided, which checks the content of each register after the outleau on odd parity. Empty or defective registers save only 0 bits, so that an error is displayed by the parity checker and the system may be stopped, although the use of such empty registers is not intended for transmission of data to the processor. In a locking circuit arrangement (45) therefore for LEDs registers of the field a locking circuit is provided, which stores a 1-bit for empty registers. This locking circuits are addressed together with the register panel, such that a 1-bit in the parity center is forced each empty register when read out. The parity checker also sets odd parity for empty registers and no unwanted error signal is generated.
