<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for producing essentially uniform spherical beads of up to 5 mm diameter of a cross-linked, waterinsoluble hydrogel by suspension polymerisation of (a) 95-30% by weight, relative to the hydrogel, of at least one watersoluble, monoolefinic monomer, which can be replaced to the extent of up to 70% by weight, relative to the total amount of the monomer, by at least one water-insoluble monomeric compound, the hydrogel containing at most 60% by weight of the water-insoluble monomeric compound, and at least 5% by weight of the total monomer consisting of a hydroxyl-substituted, hydrophilic vinyl monomer, with (b) 5 to 70% by weight, relative to the hydrogel, of a terminal diolefinic, crosslinking compound having a molecular weight of 400-8000, in the presence of a polymerisation catalyst in a concentrated, aqueous inorganic salt solution, and of a dispersing agent, and also by treatment of the hydrogel with an acid, characterised in that there is used, as dispersing agent, 0. 01-5% by weight, based on the hydrogel, of at least one water-insoluble, gelatinous, water-binding, inorganic metal hydroxide or metal hydroxide salt in the absence of excess alkali or free hydroxyl ions.
