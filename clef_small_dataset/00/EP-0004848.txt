<ABSTRACT>
a method of recovering a high-grade lecithin and  solvents from an oil-bearing full miscella which also contains  lecithin and which results from an oilseed ternary solvent  extraction process.  the method may include a first step of  phase separation of the oil-bearing miscella containing  lecithin and the ternary solvents into a polar and non-polar  phase, and a second step of azeotropic distillation of the  non-polar phase to recover a portion of the solvents, and to  remove substantially all the water from the residual crude  oil, thereby keeping the lecithin in solution.  a commercial  grade lecithin having good water dispersibility may subsequently  be recovered from the residual crude oil, and a small  amount of highly water dispersible lecithin may be recovered  from the polar phase by atmospheric distillation.  in another embodiment, when the full miscella containing  crude oil ternary solvent and lecithin resulting from the  above ternary solvent extraction is initially subjected to  azeotropic distillation to recover solvent therefrom and  remove substantially all the water, a highly water dispersible  lecithin having a high choline chloride content is obtained.   premature degumming of this highly water dispersible  lecithin is avoided by maintaining the solvent ratios above  certain minimums.  the ternary solvents for the oilseed extraction include a  lipophilic hydrocarbon, such as hexane; a water miscible  lower alcohol, such as ethanol; and a minor amount of  water.  the recovery method is energy efficient, because the  boiling temperature of the ternary azeotrope is lower than  any other combination of the three solvents.
