<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gas density, high-frequency-transparent window assembly between a gear-side (3, 4) and an output side (3 ', 4') Koa XIall line, in particular for hiking field tubes.These fen sprouts should have a large passband width and be mechanically and thermally stable.The invention provides for a hollow cylinder (1) of dielectric material between the input side (3, 4) and outlet-side (3 ', 4') coaxial line, which is the inner conductor (3) of the input-side coaxial line (3, 4)surrounds and is connected to a front side on the outer conductor (4) of the input-side coaxial line (3, 4) and with its other end face with a flange (5), which between the inner lines (3, 3 ') of the input and output sideCoaxial line is ordered.An inventive window assembly is used in particular for direct radio hiking tubes.
