<ABSTRACT>
A decomposable wire coil, as used in wire-related use, is used primarily for receiving a wire winding transported without a supporting carrier to make the wire flawless for further processing with high working speeds. The wire coil has a releasable flange (40) and a nucleus connected to the core (3), wherein the core consists of a plurality of radially apart spreading segments (26) attacking on the inside of the wire wagon. In this case, a core axle pipe (23) should be mounted axially adjustably on the hub (7) of the nuclear flanges (3), which rests on the inside on the outer wall of a likewise adjustable on the hub (7) axially adjustable and rotatably mounted hollow shaft (22) and on outside Spreading joints (25.25 ') with the core segments (26) born in turn is connected. The hollow axis (22) is limited in its axial movement in the direction of the releasable flanges (40) by a stop (15) on the hub (7), at its free end, it has a thread (37) which with a counter thread (45 ) Menkeit on the releasable flange (40).
