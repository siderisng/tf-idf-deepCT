<ABSTRACT>
a band clamp device of the invention employs a u-­ shaped housing (16) for the drive worm screw (14) usually  formed by progressive stamping from sheet metal.  the se­ parate arms (32) of the u embrace the edges of the band  (10) and the respective separate arm ends (34, 36) extend  beneath the band.  the housing can have a single ear only  (38 or 40) on one of the said separate arm ends extending  through a slot in the band to connect the housing to the  band.  usually the housing will have a single ear (38 or 40)  at each end, and the single ear adjacent the screw head  ent (18) is provided on the said separate downside arm  end (38), which is the arm end that receives the maximum  force tending to spread the housing arms apart as the  band is tightened about an object.  it is found that such a  structure is able to resist the forces tending to spread the  housing arms and to separate the housing from the band,  and it permits a wider ear to be used, or alternatively a  narrower band for the same width ear.  for greater strength  the two immediately adjacent edges of the arm ends can  be joined together, e. g. , by a welding operation.
