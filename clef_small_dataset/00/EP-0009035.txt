<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a process for the preparation of cyc­ lopentene which comprises selectively hydrogenating cyc­ lopentadiene in a liquid phase by contacting cyclopentadiene  with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst  comprising (1) a soluble nickel compound, (2) an  organoaluminum compound or a lithium alkyl compound,  and (3) at least one cocataiyst compound selected from the  group consisting of h₂o; nh₃; roh where r is an alkyl or a  halogenated alkyl radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon  atoms;    where r₁, r₂ and r₃ may be hydrogen, or an alkyl radical  containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;    where r₁, r₂ and r₃ may be hydrogen or halogen, or an alkyl  radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; r₁o r₂ wherein  r₁ and r₂ may be the same or different alkyl radicals contain­ ing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and r₁r₂    wherein r₁ may be   alkyl or an aromatic radical containing from 1 to 8 carbon  atoms and r₂ may be hydrogen or an alkyl or aromatic hyd­ rocarbon radical containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms.
