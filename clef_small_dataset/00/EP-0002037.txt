<ABSTRACT>
a method for filling containers with 'sundae-style'  yogurt includes the steps of placing a transparent lid (20)  over the top of a container (16), and providing an opening  (18) in the bottom of the closed, empty container.  the container  is inverted to position the lid at the bottom of the  container, with the opening being foremost.  a fruit fraction  (28) is introduced through the opening to form a layer of  fruit preserves overlying the inside surface of the lid.  the  remainder of the container is filled with a bacteriologically  inoculated, gum stabilized liquid milk fraction (32) introduced  through the opening.  the opening is then sealed,  and the filled inverted container is incubated so that fermentation  of the liquid milk fraction produces yogurt (55).   the inverted container is refrigerated to solidify the stabilizers  in the yogurt.  the container is then positioned in the  normal upright position, providing a container of yogurt  with sufficient gel strength to support the more dense top  layer of fruit preserves.  in an alternative embodiment, a  container (60) in an upright position is partially filled with  an inoculated, gum stabilized liquid milk fraction (32) which  is then incubated and subsequently refrigerated in a sterile  environment to produce gum stabilized yogurt (72).  a layer  of fruit preserves (76) is then added to the top surface of  the yogurt which has sufficient gel strength to support the  fruit layer.  a lid (78) is then applied to the container,  providing 'sundae-style' yogurt having a fruit preserve topping  immediately inside the lid.  techniques are also disclosed  for inhibiting intermingling of fruit preserves with  the liquid milk or yogurt fraction by providing a water-insoluble,  semi-solid edible barrier (74) of hydrogenated  animal fat or hydrogenated vegetable oil at the interface  between the fruit preserves and the liquid milk or yogurt  fraction.
