<ABSTRACT>
this apparatus comprises a deformable throwing-back frame 1 between the sides of which is stretched an elastic rebound surface 10, a deformable and foldable support frame 12 and two uprights 14 articulated on the throwing-back frame and the support frame.  the support frame 12 comprises two first elements 23 mounted rotatably on the lower side 5 of the rebound frame 1 and two second elements 26 mounted rotatably on the side 13 of the support frame 12 opposite the rebound frame, each of the elements 26 being connected to its corresponding element 23 by means of an articulation device 28 comprising, on the one hand, an articulation with transverse axis making it possible to fold the support frame against the rebound frame and, on the other hand, an articulation with a longitudinal axis making it possible for each of the elements 26 to undergo rotational movements about its longitudinal axis.  <image>
