<ABSTRACT>
1.  an endlessly rotatable electrical line coupling having one or more contact poles which have in each case annular contact discs (34", 36") which are secured axially, are disposed in radial planes, may be rotated relative to one another and bear against one another, one contact disc (36") being split radially and bent helically in each case in order to produce the axial contact pressure and a connecting lug (38") projecting radially outwards from one of the contact discs and a connecting lug (40") projecting radially inwards from another of the contact discs being provided in each case, characterized in that each contact pole has two first contact discs (34") which are disposed parallel to one another at an axial distance and are electrically conductively connected to one another and between which the second contact disc (36") is inserted, and in that the contact poles are independent units which may be joined to one another insulated from one another axially on an insulating shaft receiving the inwardly projecting connecting lug (40") in a fixed manner.
