<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for the preparation of the soil, intended to be coupled to the three-point coupling (24, 26) of an agricultural tractor.It is composed of a frame on which eight oscillating arms (6) are mounted, the ends thereof bearing four bars (12, 13), also oscillating, provided with teeth (14) intended to enter the soil and to the ground.oscillating with said bars, each of these benchings being connected by a rod (15) to one of four eccentric (17-20) forming part of a shaft (21) my tee in two bearings (22) attached to theBuilt from the apparatus and rotatively driven by means of the tractor power shaft.The original layout of toothbars (12, 13) and eccentric (17-20) ensures the free masses of the masses and distributes the effort born for the entrainment of the tree on the 360 Â° ofa revolution.
