<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the power supply of incandescent lamps by the energy extracted by capacitive coupling of an isolated section of the custody wire of a transport line. The power supply comprises a power transformation device of the custody wire into an alternating current which feeds at least one of the incandescent lamps and a control circuit mounted in the transformation device so as to control the flow rate current through the lamps. The current regulation is done with the help of a switching circuit whose switching time is set using a control circuit. In addition, an integrating circuit governs the switching time of the switching circuit while a comparator circuit ensures the formation of a symmetrical waveform at the input of this switching circuit, the integrator and comparator circuits forming the circuit. control time control.
