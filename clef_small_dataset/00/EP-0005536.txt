<ABSTRACT>
a process is provided for preparing skinless hydrophilic  alcohol-insoluble polyamide membranes by preparing a  solution of an alcohol-insoluble polyamide resin in a  polyamide solvent, inducing nucleation of the solution by  controlled addition to the solution of a nonsolvent for the  polyamide resin, under controlled conditions of concentration,  temperature, addition rate, and degree of agitation to  obtain a visible precipitate of polyamide resin particles which  may or may not thereafter partially or completely redissolve,  thereby forming a casting solution; spreading the casting  solution on a substrate to form a thin film thereof on the  substrate; contacting and diluting the film of casting solution  with a mixture of solvent and nonsolvent liquids containing a  substantial proportion of the solvent liquid, but less than the  proportion in the casting solution, thereby precipitating  polyamide resin from the casting solution in the form of a  thin skinless hydrophilic membrane; and washing and  drying the resulting membrane; the alcohol-insoluble  polyamide membranes obtained by this process have the  unusual property of being hydrophilic, i. e. , readily wetted by  water, have absolute particle removal capabilities of the  order of 0. 1 to 5 µ m or more, and are useful as filter media,  particularly for producing bacterially sterile filtrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a process for the manufacture of microporous membranes of polyhexamethylene adipamide and to membranes made by that process. for many practical applications it is necessary that a membrane should be both skinless and hydrophilic. one process for preparation of membrane sheets starts from a solution of the resin or cellulose derivative, casting a film of the solution on a support, and then forming the membrane by precipitation upon immersion of the film solution in a nonsolvent for the resin. this process results in a skinned membrane, with surface portions having fewer or very much smaller pores, or even zero pores, and an interior portion with larger pores, the outer skinned portions having higher apparent density than the interior portions. skinned membranes are non-uniform with respect to particle removal; for example, certain membranes now used for reverse osmosis are effective in accomplishing such tasks as 90% or better salt rejection, thus functioning in the 2 to 5 angstroms (0.002 to 0.005 µm) range, but are incapable of providing sterility in the effluent, allowing bacteria with diameter in the range of 2000 angstroms (0.2 µm) to pass. such membranes are poorly suited when absolute removal of particulate material such as bacteria is needed. thus, for example. us-a-3 615 024 describes the formation of anisotropic membranes having pores of from 1 to 1000 µm in diameter from a variety of synthetic resins by: (1) forming a casting dope of a polymer in an organic solvent. (2) casting a film of said casting dope. (3) preferentially contacting one face of said film with a diluent characterized by a high degree of miscibility with the organic solvent and a sufficiently low degree of compatibility with said casting dope to effect rapid precipitation of said polymer, and (4) maintaining said diluent in contact with said membrane until substantially all said solvent has been replaced with said diluent. the sub-microscopically porous anisotropic membranes of us-a-3 615 024 consist of an integral macroscopically thick film of porous polymer, usually more than 50 micrometers (about 0.05 mm (0.002 inch) and less than about 0.27 mm (0.050 inch)) in thickness. one surface of this film has an exceedingly thin but relatively dense barrier layer or "skin" of from about 0.1 to 5.0 microns thickness of microporous polymer in which an average pore diameter is in the millimicron (or nanometer) range, for example from 1.0 to 1000 millimicrons, i.e., about one-tenth to one-hundredth the thickness of the skin. the balance of the integral film structure is a support layer comprised of a much more coarsely porous polymer structure through which fluid can pass with little hydraulic resistance. by "integral film" is meant continuous, i.e., a continuing polymer phase. when such a membrane is employed as a "molecular filter" with the "skin-face" in contact with fluid under pressure, virtually all resistance to fluid flow through the membrane is encountered in the "skin", and molecules or particles of dimensions larger than the pores in the "skin" are selectively retained.
