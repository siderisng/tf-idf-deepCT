<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a process for the  preparation of a compound of the formula (i):    wherein r₁ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of up to  5 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of 5 or 6 carbon atoms,  a hydroxyalkyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms or a moiety  of the sub formula (a):    wherein r₂ is a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine  atom or an alkyl group of 1-3 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl  group of 1-3 carbon atoms, an acyloxyl group of 1-3  atoms, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group con­ taining 1-3 carbon atoms in the alkoxy part, or a group  -n(r₅)co .  r₆, -n(r₅)so₂r₆ or -co-nr₅r₆ where r₅ is a  hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1-3 carbon atoms or  a phenyl or benzyl group and r₆ is an alkyl group of 1-3  carbon atoms or a phenyl or benzyl group; r₃ is a hy­ drogen, fluorine or chlorine atom or an alkyl group of 1-3  carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group of 1-3 carbon atoms or  an acyloxyl group of 1-3 carbon atoms; and r₄ is a  hydrogen fluorine or chlorine atom or an alkyl group of  1-3 carbon atoms or an alkoxyl group of 1-3 carbon  atoms.  the disclosed process comprises inter alia the  hydrogenation of a compound of the formula (ii):    or a hydrogenolysable ester thereof wherein r₁ is as de­ fined in relation to formula (i) or r₁ is r¹₁ a moiety that on  hydrogenation provides a group r¹ as defined in formula (i), r₈ is a  lower atom or a lower alkyl group and r₁₀ is a hydrogen atom or a lower  alkyl or phenyl group.  the compounds of the formula (iii) are useful  intermediates and as such form part of this invention.
