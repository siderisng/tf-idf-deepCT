<ABSTRACT>
a lactyl tetrapeptide of the formula    can be prepared by conventional peptide synthesis.  one  isomer, fr 900156, is obtained by cultivation of a suitable  streptomyces strain such as str.  violaceus atcc 31481 or str.   olivaceogriseus atcc 31427.  the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composi­ tion comprising, as an effective ingredient, the above com­ pound in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable,  substantially non-toxic carrier or excipient.
