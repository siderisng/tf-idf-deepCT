<ABSTRACT>
a nursing bottle for location around a person's neck  whereby a baby cradled in one arm of the person can be  comfortably fed from a bottle positioned in the holder,  leaving the other arm of the person free.  the bottle holder  includes a halter member (2) and support means (8, 17, 25,  26, 34, 36) mounted on one end of the halter member for  gripping therein the bottle, the support means being freely  rotatable on the halter member in a substantially horizontal  plane to permit the bottle to follow any side-to-side movements  of the baby's head.  the support means is also  pivotable in a generally vertical plane against an adjustable  frictional resistance whereby the bottle can be retained as  desired in a retracted, inoperative position to enable winding  and the like of the baby.
