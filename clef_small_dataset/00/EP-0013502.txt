<ABSTRACT>
in a disc brake of the type including a transversely disÂ­ posed bridge bar (56) carried on the outboard end of a push  rod (50) and bearing against the inboard face of the back plate  (34) of the inboard brake pad (30), a pair of pins (64b) is  secured at their outboard ends to the respective radially outer  ends of the bridge bar.  the pins are extending axially inboard  through aligned bores (22a) in the inboard web of the brake  caper (22,24,26) to provide, as a function of the length of pins  exposed inboard of the inboard caliper web, a measure of the  remaining thickness of the brake pads (30,32).  these pins  (64b) acting as lining-wear indicators, substitute as well for  the usual means for precluding rotation of the push rod and  for providing bearing support for the push rod at its outboard  end.  whilst a self adjusting brake having an adjuster nut (51)  and ratchet mechanism (44),to take up brake pad wear is  illustrated, the invention is equally applicable to non-self  adjusting brakes, in which case the pins (64b) provide an  indication of brake pad wear when the brake is actuated.
