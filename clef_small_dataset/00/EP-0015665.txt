<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacture of vinyl chloride comÂ­ prises reacting 1,1,2-trichloroethane with hydrogen in the  vapour phase at elevated temperature in the presence of a  supported catalyst comprising a chloride of a noble metal,  a chloride of an alkali metal and a chloride of iron.

<DESCRIPTION>
manufacture of vinyl chloride this invention relates to a process for the manufacture of vinyl chloride by the hydrodechlorination of 1,1,2-trichloroethane and to catalysts for use therein. in japanese patent publication no 77/31005 there is described a process for the manufacture of vinyl chloride by reacting 1,1,2-trichloroethane with hydrogen in the presence of a supported catalyst consisting of palladium chloride, copper chloride and an alkali metal chloride; however in this process the conversion of 1,1,2trichloroethane to vinyl chloride (i.e. the number of moles of vinyl chloride produced per mole of 1,1,2-trichloroethane fed) is below 60%. we have now found that relatively high conversions to vinyl chloride may be obtained by use of a catalyst comprising a chloride of a noble metal and an alkali metal chloride together with a chloride of iron. the said catalysts also have a long active life. thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of vinyl chloride by reacting 1,1,2-trichloroethane with hydrogen in the vapour phase at elevated temperature in the presence of a supported catalyst comprising a chloride of a noble metal and an alkali metal chloride, characterized in that the catalyst also contains a chloride of iron. the noble metal chloride is preferably a chloride of platinum, palladium or rhodium; the chlorides of'palladium and rhodium are especially preferred. mixtures of the chlorides of two or more noble metals may be used if desired. the preferred alkali-metal chlorides are potassium chloride and cesium chloride; mixtures of two or more alkali-metal chlorides may be used if desired. other components which may optionally be included in the catalyst are chlorides of copper and/or chlorides of rare-earth metals (for example cerium chloride). the defined chlorides may be introduced as such during the preparation of the catalyst; alternatively, the metals may be introduced in the form of salts which are at least partially converted into the corresponding chlorides under the conditions of preparation or use of the catalyst. the proportion of iron in the catalyst is preferably from 0.5 to 20 gram atoms per gram atom of noble metal, for example from 1 to 10 gram atoms of iron per gram atom of noble metal. when the catalyst also contains copper chloride, the preferred proportion of iron is towards the lower end of the said range; thus, for example, the catalyst may contain from 2 to 10 gram atoms of copper and from 0.5 to 5 gram atoms of iron per gram atom of noble metal. the proportion of alkali metal is preferably from 1 to 25 gram atoms per gram atom of noble metal, for example from 2 to 12 gram atoms of alkali metal per gram atom of noble metal. when the catalyst also contains a rare-earth metal chloride, the preferred proportion of alkali metal is towards the lower end of the said range; thus, for example, the catalyst may contain from 2 to 10 gram atoms of rare-earth (for example cerium) and from 2 to 10 gram atoms of
