<ABSTRACT>
an agent for influencing plant growth, in particular a  herbicidal and plant growth inhibiting agent, contains, in  addition to carriers and/or other additives, at least one  compound of the formula:-    or the corresponding zwitterion form in which r and r₁  may be the same or different and each can be hydrogen,  deuterium or an optionally substituted lower alkyl group,  lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclic  radical containing one or more oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur  atoms and which may be fused to an aromatic ring, a  lower alkyl group substituted by a cycloalkyl radical; a  lower alkyl group substituted by an aryl radical, a lower  alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclic radical as defined  above, or r and r₁ together form a polymethylene chain  optionally interrupted by an oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur  atoms, or r₁ represents, together with the c(r)-n< residue  to which it is attached, the atoms required to complete a  heterocyclic radical; and r₂ and r₁ may be the same or dif­ ferent and each can be hydrogen, optionally substituted  lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or lower alkyl substituted by a  heterocyclic radical containing one or more nitrogen atom;  a heterocyclic radical containing one or more nitrogen  atoms; or r₂ and r₃, independently, together with the  c(h)-n residue to which each is attached, may each rep­ resent the atoms required to complete a heterocyclic radi­ cal; r₆ is oh ch₃; or phenyl; r₇ is hydrogen or an alkox­ ycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbony group; and n is 0, 1, 2 or  3; as well as the esters or partial esters thereof with  physiologically splittable alcohols; salts of the compounds  of formula i, or their esters or partial esters with acids or  bases physiologically acceptable to plants, respectively;  and all optical isomers thereof.
