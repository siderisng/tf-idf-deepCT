<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a semiconductor device (10) having the following construction.  a power transistor chip (100) is secured to a thermally conductive, electrically insulative plate (300) via a first solder layer (240).  the electrically insulative plate (300) is in turn secured to a heat sink (160) made of copper via a second solder layer (260).  slits (362) having a u-shaped cross-section are formed on both faces of the electrically insulative plate (300) so as to lead to the outside a gas which is entrapped into the first and second solder layers (240, 260) when they are formed.  further, a thermally conductive layer (340) is formed on both faces of the electrically insulative plate (300) at portions other than the portions of the slits (362).
