<ABSTRACT>
the aim is to provide an apparatus for saving and treating the victims of accidents suffering from hypothermia, which apparatus can be used directly at the site of the accident, or can at least be brought into its proximity, and is designed especially for rewarming.    this aim is achieved by means of a sealed rescue capsule made up of a bottom half shell (1) and a top half shell (2), there being arranged in the bottom half shell (1) a heatable base, and the top half shell (2) having sealable treatment apertures.  the half shells (1, 2) can consist of smooth outer and inner walls arranged at a distance from one another and with insulating material arranged between them.  in the bottom half shell (1), bearing surfaces can be provided for holding the arms and legs in a raised position.  the heatable base can be filled with a chemical substance reacting exothermally upon supply of liquid.  <image>
