<ABSTRACT>
this cleaning procedure consisting in imparting some  ultrasonic vibrations of which the frequency is a harmonic of  the frequency proper to at least one mode of vibration of the  groove (ib) for union of fibres in the rotor (i) of a spinning  unit, and in applying to said rotor a transducer (3) fed with  current of an ultrasonic frequency by a generator (4) in such  a way as to impart to the wall of said groove an energy  capable of detaching the impurities lodged there so that the  latter can be discharged with the help of a suction head (5)  connected to a fan (6).  this procedure can be employed especially at the time  when the yarn is pieced-up on a spinning machine of the  open-end type.
