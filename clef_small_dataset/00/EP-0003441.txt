<ABSTRACT>
a hand reel is disclosed herein particularly for use in  winding electrical extension cords.  the hand reel is a spool  with flanges (13, 15), with the cord (23) adapted to be  wrapped around the spool between the flanges.  the spool  has a central bore defined by a central hub (17) that is large  enough to accommodate the user's hand.  a supporting  member (29) is slidingly attached to the spool inside the  bore, allowing the spool to be rotated while holding the  supporting member.  the arcuate length of the supporting  member (29) is much less than the diameter of the bore,  minimizing friction and allowing cleaning.
