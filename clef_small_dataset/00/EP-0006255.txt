<ABSTRACT>
electroiysis foil, characterized in that it comprises  substantially a sheet or foil (2) of flexible metal with  which is suitably bonded a layer (3) of moisture absorb­ ing material, the whole surface of said sheet of flexible  material being provided with a large number of small  holes (4).  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
electrolysis foil. this invention relates to an electrolysis foil, in other words a foil which may be used as an anode or a cathode when carrying out an electrolysis. the purpose of such electrolysis foil is to be used in all the circumstances involving pieces which either are too large to be immerged into a bath or are disassembled with difficulty or still require too much time to be disassembled and assembled. another object of such electrolysis foil according to the invention is to be used with pieces wherein an electrolysis must be only carried out locally without protecting the portions not being treated. still another object of the electrolysis foil according to the invention is to allow its use for treating as well flat surfaces as surfaces with irregularities, it being possible to treat efficiently and accurately even sharp angles formed between these irregularities. the electrolysis foil according to the invention is substantially characterized in that it comprises a sheet or a foil of flexible metal with which is suitably bonded a layer of a moisture absorbing material, the whole surface of said sheet of flexible material being provided with a large number of small holes. in order to make more clearly apparent the characteristics of this invention, such electrolysis foil will be described hereafter by way of example and without any limitation, reference being made of the enclosed drawings in which figure 1 is a partial perspective view of an electro lysis foil according to the invention; figure 2 shows, on an elarged scale, a cross-section taken on the line ii-ii of figure 1. as shown in the enclosed drawings, the electrolysis foil 1 comprises substantially a sheet of flexible material or foil 2 on which is secured a layer of a moisture absorbing material 3, said layer 3 being suitably bonded with foil 2 so that the electrolysis is not at all inhibited. in addition, according to the invention, the foil 2 is provided with a large number of small holes 4 along which the gases formed during the electrolysis may be evolved. in a preferred embodiment, the foil 2 will be an aluminium foil, whereas the layer 3 will be a felt layer, said felt layer 3 being secured with the foil 2 through a so-called "needling" with a needling-machine known per se, so that during the "needling" operation, a portion 5 of the material of the felt 3 will be stitched through the foil 2 as represented in figure 2, thereby securing the layer 3 with the foil 2, on one hand, while automatically forming the said holes 4, on the other hand. when it is necessary, e.g. to remove impurities, grease, metal precipitates and the like form a determined element, portion of an element or similar, it is sufficient to dispose the electrolysis foil according to the invention with the layer 3 in an electrically conducting liquid, more particu larly an electrolyte and still more particularly, e.g. phosphoric acid, an electrode being then assembled
