<ABSTRACT>
in a multi-wheel lens edge grinding machine of a type defined there is a difficulty in providing positive drive to displace the frame (16) between the different grinding positions whilst allowing the frame to "float" during the grinding operation.  this difficulty is resolved by driving the frame via a cam plate engaged by the frame and which plate affords positive transverse engagement with the frame whilst the frame is elevated and a less restricting engagement with the frame when the frame is lowered to a grinding position.

<DESCRIPTION>
inprovements in or relating to lens edge grinding machines this invention relates to lens edge grinding machines and more particularly to so-called "multiwheel" lens edge grinding machines for grinding the edges of spectacle and the like lenses. #ulti-wheel lens edge grinding machines are well known in the art and conventionally comprise a base housing1 a frame mounted atop the base and pivotable about a horizontal axis, a driven shaft, supporting a plurality of grinding wheels within the base to present the upper regions of the grinding wheels through an opening in an upper surface of the base housing, and co-axially aligned lens supports presented by the frame and intended to engage the major faces of a lens therebetween. the pivotal axis of the frame, the axis of said driven shaft and the common axis, of the lens supports are all parallel, the frame is arranged for displacement in the direction of its pivotal axis to allow a supported lens to be engaged selectively with any one of said grinding wheels, and means are provided for rotating the lens supports in accordance with a predetermined programme. in all conventional lens edge grinding machines the first grinding wheel is a plain cylindrical wheel intended to rough grind the lens to a desired peripheral configuration and the second grinding wheel is intended to impart the desired peripheral cross-section on the lens. as different lenses often require different peripheral cross-sections it is convenient to mount at least two different second grinding wheels on the shaft and whereby the operator may select the desired second grinding wheel to be used for each lens. to obtain the desired peripheral configuration for the lens, one of the lens edge supports conveniently carries a cam, engageable alith an anvil individually set to each of the grinding wheels, and the cam is rotated with the lens thus to angularly adjust the frame -relative to the base during -grinding so that the desired peripheral configuration is imparted -to the lens. with many lenses the periphery of the lens does not lie- in one plane and whilst with the first grinding, and in fact with many second grindings, the frame is advantageously allowed to- "float" transversely to permit that part of the lens edge in contact with the grinding wheel to "#self locate" with-respect to the wheel, other "second" grinding operations require a more positive guide to effect displacement of the frame relative to the base. thus, it is often required to grind a "v" rib, with a base smaller than the thickness of the edge of the lens to follow a particular path about the periphery of the lens. this "v" rib is normally ground-finished on a "second" grinding wheel and, to obtain the desired path for the "v" rib, a peg on the front of the frame is arranged to engage a cam surface, frequently formed on one edge of a metal member, mounted on the base and hereby the frame is transversely displaced, as said frame is-angularly displaced

 frame (16)    when said frame (16) is in an elevated position, and a drive arrangement #(35,  36) for positively displacing said cam plate (30) in the general direction of the said pivot shaft   (15).      2. a   multi-wheel    lens edge grinding machine as claimed in claim 1 in which the cam plate (30) includes a cam opening (37) therethrough and said frame element (44) always projects into said opening (37).   3.   h    multi-wheel lens edge grinding machine as claimed in claim 2 in which the opening (37) includes a slotlike part (38, 42, 43) into which the frame element (44) protects
