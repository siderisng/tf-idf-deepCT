<ABSTRACT>
a biassed friction bearing (55, 56, 57) for use with a tool  holder of a machine tool comprising a plate (60), one side of  it has a plurality of ribs (61, 61, 63, 64) and the other side of  which is coated with a synthetic resin layer (66), said plate  being alternately concave and convex near consecutive ribs  (61, 62, 63, 64) on the side (66) coated with synthetic resin and  a method of manufacturing said bearing (55, 56, 57) by  reducing the height of even numbered ribs (62, 64), coating  one side with a synthetic resin layer (66), securing the plate to  a flat surface (67) and by flattening the side coated with the  synthetic resin layer (66).

<DESCRIPTION>
biassed friction bearing and method of manufacturing and mounting the' same. the invention relates to a biassed friction bearing for use with a carriage or a tool holder of a machine tool and to a method of manufacturing and mounting the same. in order to achieve high accuracy it is important for the moving parts to be journalled with a minimum of play. for this purpose biassed bearings may be employed, which obviate any gap between the bearing and the body to be supported. such biassed bearings can be manufactured only with difficulty, so that their accuracy is limited. the invention has for its object to provide a biassed friction bearing which combines an accurate design with a simple method of manufacture. this is achieved by means of a plate, one side of which is coated with a synthetic resin layer and which has alternating concave and convex shapes near consecutive ribs on the side coated with the synthetic resin layer. at the convex places the friction layer can produce a pressure by the bas stress on the supported body so that any gaps are bridged. a friction bearing according to the invention may have five ribs, the plate being concave near the first rib and convex at the next rib and so forth. in the mounted state the friction bearing may be arranged in a slot and be guarded against a longitudinal displacement by securing it at the medium rib. according to the invention the friction bearing can be manufactured by the successive staps of reducing the height of even numbered ribs of a plate having ribs of equal height on one side, coating the plate on the side remote from the ribs with a synthetic resin layer, fixing the plate with the ribs to a flat surface so that the free ends of the ribs are substantially in line with one another, and flattening the plae on the side coated with synthetic resin. in this way the desired bias stress can be obtained in the plate so that the plate is locally convex. the synthetic resin layer may be glued to the plate. for mounting the friction bearing it can be secured at the convex places by connecting the ribs locally by bolts with a support so that the resin-coated side is substantially flat, the bolt being loosened after the insertion of the body to be journalled. therefore, during the insertion of the body to be journalled the bearing is substantially flat so that the body can be readily inserted without the risk of damage of the bearing. subsequently, the bolt joint is loosened so that the bearing resumes the locally convex position and will exert the desired pressing force on the supported body. the invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing, which shows an embodiment. in the drawing figure 1 is a perspective view of a machine tool in accordance with the invention, some parts being broken away, figures 2 to 5 illustrate
