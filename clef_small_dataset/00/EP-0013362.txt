<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sealed two-phase, with a liquid operating with a liquid and vaporized liquid for heat transfer, which is system-independent and does not require a wick.A filled container (10) is filled with a liquid which can form a cooling vapor bubble (17) which is centered because of the surface properties (surface energy) of the liquid pressure within the container.The supply of heat in the evaporator portion (16) causes a damping of the liquid on the parting surface between the liquid phase and the vapor phase.The steam flows through the bubble and condenses on the opposite side where heat is released and the liquid in the evaporator on section (16) is supplemented by the return (19) via a continuous liquid film.
