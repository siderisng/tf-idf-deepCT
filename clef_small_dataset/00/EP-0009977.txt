<ABSTRACT>
water-swellable particulate absorbents have improved  dispersibility in blood by surface-treatment with a hyd­ rocarbon compound which is an aliphatic hydrocarbon or a  substantially nonionic derivative thereof which is non-­ volatile and has a melting point below 35°c, or is a c₁₂-c₁₈  alkyl trimethylammonium halide.  examples of suitable  aliphatic hydrocarbons are n-dodecane, n-hexadecane;  n-heptadecane and n-octadecane.  preferred derivatives are  fatty alcohols, fatty acids and fatty acid esters.

<DESCRIPTION>
absorbent }materials this invention relates to absorbent materials, more especially absorbent materials suitable for use in absorber disposable products such as sanitary towels or napkins and tampons and absorbent products for surgical or medical use. the invention also relates to processes for producing such materials and to absorbent articles containing such materl. in recent years there has been much interest in the synthesis of absorbent polymers having' a high capacity for absorbing water and body fluids. a number of different polymers have been developed some being wholly synthetic iz! nature and some partially synthetic. among the partially synthetic absorbent polymers are those based on starch. these include the starch-acrylonitrlle graft copolymers described in us patent specifications nos 3,997,484 (the usa as represented by the secretary of agriculture) and 3,661,815 (grain processing corporation), and the cross-linked gelatinised starch derivatives described in german patent application no 2702781. other examples of partially synthetic absorbent polymers are the carboxymethylated cellulose described in us patent specification no.3,589,364 (buckeye cellulose corporation), and the carboxymetbyl- cellulose cross-linked by acid inter-esterification as described by podlas, t.j., in inda tech. symp. 1976, 2-3 march, pp 25-39. wholly synthetic abs orb nts include polyacrylates crosslinked with a polyamide/epichlorhydrin material as described in-us patent specification no. 4,076,673 (dow chemical company) and the potassium salts of polyacrylic acid cross-linked by aluminium ions as described in us patent specification no.4,090,013 (national starch and-chemical corporation). the above materials are substantially water-insoluble and absorb many times their weight of water, urine or other aqueous body exudates. they retain a particulate character as they imbibe surrounding liquid and swell. in most cases, even with water, the swollen particles are gelatinous and andtaky form clusters. an exception is the cross-linked starch derivative described in german patent application no.2702781, the particles of which on absorbing water are substantially non-tacky and dry to the touch. however even this starch derivative, as well as the other ahtsv-¯ne-: previously referred to, has poor dispersibility in blood that when blood is brought into contact with a mass of tt,- absorbent significant penetration into the bed and hence absorption is extremely slow. the particles have therefore what may ba described as poor "blood wet-out" so that on exposure to blood the particulate material at the inside a mass remains unreached by the blood. although the mechanism is not understood at the present time, it appears that the blood on initial contact with the particles fonts some sort of mass which acts as a barrier to the passage the blood through the surface layers of the particles. an object of the invention is to provide an absorbend composition having improved blood dispersibility, or wet-out'1. it is also an object to provide a process for producing such an improved absorbent. according to the invention there is provided a water swellable particulate absorbent material surface-treaten enhance its dispersibility in blood with a hydrocarbon compound which is an aliphatic hydrocarbon or a substantial nonionic derivative thereof, which aliphatic hydrocarbo nonionic derivative is non-volatile and has a melting
