<ABSTRACT>
a two-stroke engine of mixed induction type comprises a  first duct (19) for direct induction or intake of the mixture into  the cylinder chamber (16) and at least one further duct for  induction or intake by reeds, the further duct(s) is (are) proÂ­ vided in the cylinder and opens (open) into the cylinder  chamber (16) and/or into the transfer ducts (24).  the engine is  equipped with a reed valve also forming the subject of the  invention, and comprising a free central passage (52) and at  least one further passage (54) provided with reed actuator  (55).

<DESCRIPTION>
"a mixed intake two-stroke engine and reed valve therefor" . this invention relates to a combined or mixed intake twostroke engine (i.e. an engine with intake by piston valve and reed valve comprising a first duct for direct intake sf the mixture into the cylinder chamber and one or more additional ducts for intake by reeds. such engines are used, for example, in the motorcycle environment, but also for industrial engines, as engines for motorsaws, small tractors, etc. the invention also relates to a reed valve for mixed intake two-stroke engine of the type above set forth. lately, in the field of two-stroke engines for motorcycles a "mixed" type of intake has been developed, having over other conventional intake systems the advantage of very little mixture blow-back at low r.p.m. and a high filling degree throughout the rotational range of the engine. a prior art engine of mixed intake system type has an intake duct branching off in the engine cylinder; a first branch thereof directly enters the cylinder chamber; and the second branch diverges from the first branch and terminates in the engine block; a reed valve is placed on this second branch. this known engine has the disadvantage that the intake system also involves the engine block, which is a highly costly part; accordingly, as a whole the engine is remarkably expensive. engines are also known that use only one (and accordingly not mixed) type of intake through reed valves; particularly, they have the reed valve(s) interposed on a single intake duct and the whole intake occurs through the reeds. these engines have the disadvantage of a not high filling degree at low r.p.m. due to the impediment to the passage of the sucked-in flow caused by the resistance to the opening of the obturating reeds. in order to overcome such disadvantages of the prior art a two-stroke engine and valve according to this application have been devised. in addition to the usual intake duct provided in the cylinder and opening into the cylinder chamber, the engine comprises one or more additional intake ducts provided in the cylinder and opening into the cylinder transfer ducts. such additional ducts are branches of the usual duct, and according to a further preferred feature of the invention a seat is formed at the branching location for a reed valve or "reed holder" which also forms part of the invention. the valve has a first free passage intended to be placed at said intake duct and one or more additional passages provided with flow regulating reeds intended to be placed at said additonal ducts. generally, but not necessarily, this reed holder or reed support is of a tapered shape, such as a frustrum of pyramid having four or more sides, wherein the first passage is axial, while the other passages are provided on one or more faces or sides of the pyramid. this novel engine and reed holder structure allows without any changes to use blocks already in use for other types
