<ABSTRACT>
1.  installation for separating gaseous noxious substances, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and sulphur oxide, from flue gases, more especially of refuse-incineration plants, by reaction with pulverulent additives, such as quickline (cao) or calcium carbonate (caco3 ), and bonding to these latter, consisting of a plurality of pipe cascades (1, 2 . . .  3) comprising throughflow sections connected in series in the direction of flow of the flue gases which cascades are connected by interposition of cyclone separators (4 . . .  5) and of proportioning tubes (15, 17 . . .  18) for the additives and arranged in the through-flow sections of the pipe cascades, the proportioning tube (18) projecting into the least pipe cascade being provided with a supply pipe (19') for fresh additives, while the order proportioning tubes are respectively connected of that cyclone separator, connected on the output side, of the following pipe cascade, seen in the direction of gas flow, characterised in that the proportioning tubes (15, 17 . . .  18) are arranged in vertical sections (1', 2', . . .  3') of the pipe cascades (1, 2 . . .  3) and communicate with the outlet (5'', 6'') of the cyclone separator (5 . . .  6) connected on the output side of the next upper pipe cascades (2 . . .  3), and that the odd-numbered pipe cascades (1, 3) are arranged in vertical axial alignement with the cyclone separators (5) of the even-numbered pipe cascades (2) are arranged in vertical axial alignement with the cyclone separators (4, 6) of the odd-numbered pipe cascades (1, 3).
