<ABSTRACT>
a vehicular air disc brake of the wedge actuator type in  which the wedge actuator is secured to the air motor by an  annular fastener (42) which is snap locked in place in a blind  bore (52) in the free end of the wedge actuator (28b) and which  acts to secure the free end of the piston rod (40) of the air  motor to the wedge actuator in response to generally linear  movement of the piston rod into the fastener.  the fastener  (42) is split (at 50) to allow insertion into the blind bore (52) in  the free end of the wedge actuator, and includes a plurality of  finger portions (48) which together define a single helical  thread disposed within the blind bore; this single thread  allows the threads on the air motor piston rod (40) to ratchet  therepast upon insertion of the piston rod, allows the piston  rod (40) to be threaded out of the fastener (42) for disassembly  purposes, and.  in the event of inadvertent backing out rotation  of the piston rod, allows the piston rod (40) to reseat in the  blind bottom (52f) of the wedge actuator brake in response to  the next actuation of the air motor.
