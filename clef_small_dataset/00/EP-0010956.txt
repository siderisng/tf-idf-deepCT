<ABSTRACT>
a wound clutch facing is made from a glass yarn of  a rough physical form and a binder.  the glass yarn  contains at least one continuous filament strand and may  for example be a doubled yarn or a yarn having a structure  in which a sliver of staple glass is wound on a continuous  filament core, or a yarn with a core (8) structure out of  which loops (9) project at intervals.  the latter yarn can  be made by a wrapping technique.  the binder can include both thermoset resin and  rubber.  the method for the manufacture of the clutch  facings consists in first impregnating the yarn, then  winding the impregnated yarn into the form of a facing  and press-curing the facing.
