<ABSTRACT>
a track assembly for a sliding closure member com­ prising a track (12) extending in a longitudinal direction, a  support arm (10) mounted at one end in the track (12) for  travelling movement along the track (12) by a connection  (17) which retains the arm (10) generally perpendicular to  the track (12) during part of the travelling movement and  permits rotation of the arm (10) about an axis perpendic­ ular to the common plane of the track (12) and arm (10)  in one end region of the track, the connection (17) com­ prising a ball roller (20) mounted on the arm (10) for rol­ ling movement along the track (12) when the arm (10) is  generally perpendicular to the track (12) and permitting  rotation of the connection (17) about the axis perpendic­ ular to the common plane of the arm (10) and the track  (12), and means for engaging the connection to prevent  such rotation when the connection (17) is not positioned  in the end region of the track (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
patens act 1977 specification title track for sliding closure. descripti0n. this invention relates to track assemblies for sliding closure members, in particular for sliding vehicle doors. in one known type of sliding closure system used widely for vehicle doors, when closed the external surface of the door lies flush with the external surface of the surrounding frame. when the closure is opened its initial movement is generally in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the aperture so that the closure is moved clear of the surrounding frame. the closure is then moved in a direction parallel to the plane of the aperture to allow entry into the aperture. in order to allow this movement, the closure is supported on a number of track assemblies, one of which includes a support arm mounted in a track by a connection which retains the support arm generally perpendicular to the track during the movement of the closure parallel to the plane of the aperture, and permits rotation of the arm about an axis perpendicular to the common plane of the track and arm in one end region of the track to allow the closure to move into and out of the aperture in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the aperture. such track assemblies have included at least two sets of bearings one of which is effective to carry the closure member on the track, the other of which carries the support arm and permits rotation thereof in as the closure enters or leaves the aperture. the construction of such track assemblies is relatively complicated and expensive. as a result, it has become the usual practice to incorporate only one such track assembly in a sliding door assembly, the remaining track assemblies having rigidly eerpeetedlrsupport arms which travel along a track having arcuate end regions. the end regions of track assemblies of this type project outside the plane of the aperture. cofl#'lcflt4# in vehicles, the track assemblies encroach into the passenger or storage area of the vehicle, where they occupy useful space and are susceptible to damage. in accordance with the present invention we provide a track assembly for a sliding closure member comprising track extending in a longitudinal direction ,a support arm mounted at one end in the track for travelling move- nt along the track by a connection which retains the arm generally perpendicular to the track during part of the travelling movement and permits rotation of the arm about an axis perpendicular to the common plane of the track and arm in one end region of the track, characterised in that tha connection comprises a ball roller mounted on the arm for rolling movement along the track when the arm is generally perpendicular to the track, and permitting rotation of the connection about the axis perpendioiilar to the common plane of the arm and the track, and means for engaging the connection to prevent such rotation when the connection is not positioned in the end region of the
