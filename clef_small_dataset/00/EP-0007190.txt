<ABSTRACT>
process for production of a coated particulate filler by  contacting the surface of a siliceous filter, e. g.  silica or a metal  silicate, with an unsaturated acidic group-containing organic  polymer, e. g.  a polydiene carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid  anhydride, and, polymer compositions, e. g.  plastic or rubber  compositions, containing the coated particulate filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
emi1.1 this invention relates to novel polymer-coated siliceous fillers, to a process for producing the fillers, and to polymer compositions containing the fillers. it is well known to modify the properties of a wide variety of organic polymers, e.g. plastics or rubbers, by incorporating into such polymers one or more inorganic materials in finely divided form. these inorganic materials, commonly known as fillers, may serve either to increase the bulk of the resultant polymer composition so as to permit a polymer to be used more economically, or to enhance at least some of the physical properties. of the polymer, for example the hardness, modulus, tensile strength, or resistance to wear of the polymer. not only is it desirable to make such fillers as compatible as possible with organic polymers but it is also desirable to be able to make compositions containing high proportions of inorganic material so as to confer the physical and cost advantages of the inorganic material on the resulting composition to the maximum practicable extent. it is especially desirable, when considering possible shortages of hydrocarbon raw materials to be able to use cheap and readily available inorganic raw materials as much as possible. in our copending application british patent application no 22277/77 (belgian patent no 867 333) we have described a process for the production of a coated particulate filler which process comprises binding to the surface of a basic particulate filler an acidic group-containing organic polymer, which polymer contains at least one unsaturated group. it is believed that in this process the acidic group-containing organic polymer reacts with the basic groups on the particulate filler and thereby becomes bound to the surface of the filler. when such a coated filler is mixed with an organic polymer to form a polymer composition, or is formed in situ in a polymer composition, we find that the properties, e.g. the tensile properties and tear strength, of the composition are superior to the properties of a similar filled composition in which the filler which has been used does not contain a coating of the acidic group-containing organic polymer. we have now found that a polymer composition comprising an organic polymer, e.g. a plastic or rubber, and a siliceous filler which filler has been contacted with an acidic group-containing organic polymer, either in situ in the polymer composition or before formation of the polymer composition, possesses properties, e.g. tensile properties and tear strength, superior to the properties of a composition comprising an organic polymer and a siliceous filler which filler has not been contacted with an acidic group-containing organic polymer. this is particularly surprising as the siliceous filler contains no basic group, or at most only a very small proportion of such groups, and thus the acidic group-containing organic polymer would not be expected to become bound to the surface of the siliceous filler by reaction with the acidic groups in the acidic group-containing organic polymer. according to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of a
