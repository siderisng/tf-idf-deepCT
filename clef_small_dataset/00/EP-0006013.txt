<ABSTRACT>
a handwriting recognition device 2 comprises a transducer  surface responsive to a pen positioned thereon for  representing the coordinate position of the pen as an  electrical signal, and data processing means for recognising  a handwriting effected with the pen, the data processing  means including a microprocessor based control controlling  a read/write memory, a non-volatile read-only memory  storing a handwriting recognition routine to store recognised  handwriting in the read/write memory, and an interface  communicating to a host computer system a representation  of the recognised handwriting.  a visual display 6 may be  provided coupled to a display interface and an input interface  for receiving verified recognised handwriting communicated  from the host computer system.  the read/write memory has  a first storage location coupled to the transducer storing a  representation of signals from the transducer, a second  storage location coupled to the interface and storing a  representation of recognised handwriting, and a third storage  location coupled to the display interface and storing an  image of the display.
