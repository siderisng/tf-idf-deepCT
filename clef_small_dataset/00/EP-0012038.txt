<ABSTRACT>
superinsulation for use in cryogenic tanks comprises hollow  insulating spheres of polymeric material which (a) are  between 0,32. 10⁻² and 3,81. 10⁻²m in overall diameter; (b)  have at least one evacuation hole (22), and (c) are provided  with reflective material to form a radiation shield.  the reflective  material may be in the form of a coating (18) or formed by  incorporating reflective material (30) in the structure of the  hollow insulating spheres.  the outside of the hollow insulating  spheres may be coated with a low friction material to  facilitate packing.  in a superinsulation system comprising first and second  walls the overall diameter of the hollow insulating spheres is  preferably chosen to be between 1/12 and 1/24 of the distance  between the walls.  according to the present invention there is provided  superinsulation comprising a plurality of hollow insulating  spheres composed of polymeric material, characterized in that  each of said hollow insulating spheres (a) has an overall  diameter from 0. 125 to 1. 5 inches, (b) has at least one evacuation  hole, and (c) is provided with reflective material to  form a radiation shield.  the reflective material may comprise reflective particles,  for example coated microspheres, uncoated glass microspheres,  metal chips, silica flakes and mixtures thereof.  in  the case of microspheres, the hollow insulating spheres are  preferably composed of a composite material comprising a  polymeric resin and a plurality of microspheres in which the  ratio of the volume of the microspheres to the volume of  polymeric resin is greater than 1:1.  as an alternative to, or in addition to, reflective  particles, the hollow insulating spheres may be coated internally  or externally with a layer of reflective material which  is preferably from 25 to 150 å thick.  the coating may be  applied direct to the surface of the hollow insulating sphere  or over a sealing layer as described hereinafter.  in order to facilitate packing (and thereby reducing  settlement after initial packing), the hollow insulating  spheres are preferably provided with a coating of a low  friction material.  preferably the thickness of the wall of said hollow  insulating spheres is from 0. 005 to 0. 09 inches and the overall  diameter of said hollow insulating spheres is from 0. 125  to 1. 5 inches.  the present invention also provides a superinsulation  system comprising an evacuated insulation space formed  between a first wall and a second wall spaced from said first  wall, characterized in that the evacuated insulation  space contains superinsulation in accordance with the present  invention.  in such an arrangement the overall diameter of  the hollow insulating spheres is preferably from 1/12 to 1/24  of the distance between the first and second walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to superinsulation and to a @@@@rinsulation system. conventional tanks for the storage and transportation ryogenic liquid commonly utilize perlite, or similar > > s of particulate insulation material, in the evacuated space between the inner cryogenic vessel and the surrounding fret. when newly installed, the particulate insulation for commercially sized vessel may have a low heat leak in the ##er of 1,500 btus per hour. however, after compaction of the particulate insulation over a period of time, the heat leak may rise to as high as 20,000 btus per hour. other forms of insulation having superior insulating properties are generally referred to as superinsulation. these typically comprise layers of aluminium foil separated by a low conduct ivity material such as fibreglass, or aluminized layers of crinkled mylar. newly installed superinsulation may have a heat leak as low as 250 btus/hr for a commercial size vessel, but as compaction occurs, this value may rise as high as 700 3tus/hr. in addition, this form of insulation is quite difficult to install and repair since the many layers must be wrapped around the inner vessel before it is installed within the outer jacket. because of the higher cost, the use of such superinsulation has been generally limited to vessels for transporting and/or storing ultra low boiling point cryogens such as liquid hydrogen and helium. the present invention, at least in its preferred embodiments, combines the pourability of the particulatetype insulation which the substantially higher insulation values of conventional forms of superinsulation. in addition the present invention, at least in its preferred embodiments, results in a superinsulation which is substantially lighter in weight than the particulate-type insulation and is significantly lower in installed cost than the previous superinsulation systems. according to the present invention there is provided superinsulation comprising a plurality of hollow insulating spheres composed of polymeric material, characterized in that each of said hollow insulating spheres (a) has an overall diameter from 0.125 to 1.5 inches, (b) has at least one evaccation hole, and (c) is provided with reflective material to form a radiation shield. the reflective material may comprise reflective partices, for example coated microspheres, uncoated glass microspheres, metal chips, silica flakes and mixtures thereof. in the case of microspheres, the hollow insulating spheres are preferably composed of a composite material comprising a polymeric resin and a plurality of microspheres in which the ratio of the volume of the microspheres to the volume of polymeric resin is greater than 1:1. as an alternative to, or in addition to, reflective particles, the hollow insulating spheres may be coated inter ally or externally with a layer of reflective material which is preferably from 25 to 150 2 thick. the coating may be applied direct to the surface of the hollow insulating sphere or over a sealing layer as described hereinafter. in order to facilitate packing (and thereby reducing settlement after initial packing), the hollow insulating spheres are preferably provided with a coating of a low friction material. preferably the thickness
