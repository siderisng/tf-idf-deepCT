<ABSTRACT>
in a coffee machine having rising pipe (32) and flat heater, the flat heater is composed of a boiling disc (10), projecting all round beyond its electric heating element (12), and a base disc (11) of high thermal conductivity and is held by a flexible sealing ring (19) encompassing its edge.  consequently, the heating energy is, to an increased extent, directed towards the centre of the boiling space (20) adjoining the upper side of the flat heater (10, 11), and the region of the coffee machine housing (29) adjoining the edge of the flat heater (10, 11) is protected from a relatively large degree of heating, so that an inexpensively producible one-cup coffee machine having a plastic coffee machine housing of small dimensions can be realised.  <image>
