<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the application forms a large-area light source consisting of a prismatic light-passing body in which light occurs through a small side surface and having a large side surface through which the light emerges, in which a uniform luminance distribution is achieved over the large side surface,by forming the translucent body as a thin wedge (1), the light through a binding large side surfaces (2, 3) against each other inclined large side surfaces (2, 3) and on a base surface (5) of the wedge (1) perpendicularly located narrow side surface (4) of the wedge(1) occurs in this entry and by one of the mutually inclined large side surfaces (2, 3) of the wedge (1).
