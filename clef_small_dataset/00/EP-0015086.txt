<ABSTRACT>
a kelly bushing (16) for a downhole drilling system is  constructed to allow an electric cable connected to a dowÂ­ nhole motor or a sensing mechanism located in the area of the  downhole motor for feeding back to the surface appropriate  electrical signals indicative of certain drilling operations, to be  fed into the hole being drilled alongside the drill string without  interfering with engagement between the kelly bushing and  the kelly (10).  the kelly bushing includes a pair of rollers (22.   24) mounted in the bearings (30, 32) and adapted to engage  the kelly to allow the kelly (10) and the attached drill string (4,  6) to move in a forward direction into the hole being drilled  while preventing any rotational or lateral movement.  a base  plate (36) of the kelly bushing has an opening through which  the kelly passes and through which an electric cable can be  guided into the hole, and a gate (56) is hinged to the base plate  to permit entry of the cable into the opening of the base plate  (36).
