<ABSTRACT>
a rotatable cutting tool (10) includes an ex­ pandable cutting section (40) and a leading end having  an expandable guiding portion or pilot (16) for properly  aligning the tool in a bore.  the trailing end of the tool may  have an expandable guiding portion or pilot (18) for aligning  the tool during movement back trough the bore which has  been machined.  a one-piece body (20) of the tool has a  helical slot (24) extending axially therethrough and has  an inner tapered surface (26) for mounting the tool on a  tapered shaft (12) such that movement of the body along  the shaft by nuts (34, 36, 38) controls the size of the cutting  section and the guiding portion or portions.  this expand­ able tool construction is particularly suitable for abrasion  tools and has abrasive particles (22) secured to the cutting  section (40).
