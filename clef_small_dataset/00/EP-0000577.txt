<ABSTRACT>
a material handling device is disclosed for use in a material  holding, or storage, receptacle.  the device includes a vertically  positioned discharge duct having spaced apertures  therein with the bottom of the duct connected to a discharge  access passage whereby granular, free flowing material, such  as grain, within the receptacle, is withdrawn through the apertures  and discharge duct in a manner such that the withdrawn  material is from the top of the stored mass.  the apertures are  either staggered or opposed with respect to one another  along the discharge duct.  material loading is through the top  of the receptacle with the loading duct, or channel, being  formed in a manner so as to prevent damage by impact to the  material being introduced.
