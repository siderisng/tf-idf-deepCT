<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for retaining asepsis of a sterile  web of bags as the web is fed onto the filling pipe of a packaging  machine.  the filling pipe is enclosed by a sterilizing  boot (76) and sterilized by directing a sterilizing agent into  the boot.  one end of a sealed web of bags (86), the interior of  which is sterile, is then attached to the boot via an interposed  absorbent material (82) saturated with a sterilizing medium,  such as hydrogen peroxide.  preferably, the filling pipe has a  barbed cone (42) attached to its upstream end with which the  attached adjacent walls (103, 102) of the boot and web  respectively are pierced so that the sterilized pipe is then  positioned within the sterile web of bags without destroying  the sterile condition of the pipe or the web.
