<ABSTRACT>
a modular building structure comprises a support  structure (10) including a plurality of spaced vertical columns,  (11) and horizontal beams (12) interconnected between  columns to form a rigid support system.  at least one  space module (22) structurally defining an enclosed volumne  of space is adapted to be removably supported from said  support structure.  there are provided in combination, utility  conduits (45-49) integrated with at least some of said  columns and connectable at their lower ends to utility inlets  and outlets (41).  there are also column manifold means (50)  at a plurality of levels in each of the vertical columns, the  manifold means having connections to the utility conduits.   module manifold means (62) are provided in the space  modules and have connections to utility conduits (92-98)  within the modules.  coupling members (65) each having  conduits for the utilities and means for connection to both a  column manifold means and a module manifold means are  provided, said connection means being constructed and  arranged so that connection of the coupling member with a  manifold means in a column and a module connects  together the utility conduits in the module and the column  via the conduits in the coupling member.
