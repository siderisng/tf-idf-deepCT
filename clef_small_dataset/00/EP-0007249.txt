<DESCRIPTION>
"fluid pump apparatus" the present invention relates to portable fluid pump apparatus and more particularly but not exclusively to a fluid pump attachment for a chain saw engine or other portable hand-held internal combustion engine. it is known to have attachments for chain saw engines in which the blade and cutting chain of the chain saw are removed and an attachment, such as a rotary drill, is secured to the chain saw engine by means of a member having a shape similar to that of a chain saw blade. a chain driven by the output of the engine is then used to drive the attachment. known such arrangements are shown in u.s. patents 2,810,409, 3,580,342 and 2,783,794. it is also known to have internal combustion engines driving pumps, and in particular liquid pumps, the output of the pump being passed through a flexible hose or conduit to a spray nozzle. for example see u.s. patents 3,320,895, 2,737,340, 3,018,927, 3,857,515. although such engine and pump combinations have hitherto been portable in the sense that they were able to be carried from place to place, they were only able to be operated with the engine, pump and their mounting frame supported by the ground or some supporting platform such as the tray of a truck. it is further known t9 attach pumps to electrical hand drills as shown in u.s. patent 3,059,583. however, such arrangements are not only very restricted in their portable use and capacity, but also cannot be used at all where there is no electricity supply. finally, it is also known to have portable spray misting apparatus for use in spraying insecticides and other chemicals on orchard trees and other plants. such apparatus typically comprises a back pack which includes a tank and small internal combustion engine mounted together and arrange be b carried on the back of an operator. the pump is directly connected tothe output shaft of the small internal combustion engine, the bearings of which support the pump rotor. the output of the pump is connected to a spray nozzle via a flexible conduit. the operator carries the apparatus on his back and directs the spray by altering the direction in which the nozzle is pointed. irrespective of the direction of spray, the engine remains in substantially the same position. it is the object of the present invention to overcome some of the disadvantages of the abovementioned prior art apparatus and to provide apparatus which is of lower cost than hitherto, and is more flexible in terms of the uses to which the apparatus may be put. there is disclosed herein a portable attachment for a chain saw having an internal combustion engine and a drive sprocket, said attachment comprising a housing defining an endless track to receive and guide a driven chain in its movement along a predetermined path, a driven sprocket rotatably attached to the housing at one end and extending into said path for power transmitting engagement with said chain so as to

<CLAIMS>
 claims    "fluid pump apparatus"  1. a portable chain saw attachment for a portable chain saw powerhead having an internal combustion engine and a drive sprocket, said attachment comprising a housing defining an endless tract to receive and guide a driven chain in its movement along a predetermined path, a driven sprocket rotatably attached to the housing at one end and extending into said path for power transmitting engagement with said chain so as to be driven thereby, fluid pump means secured to said housing and attached to said driven sprocket so as to be driven thereby, said housing being adapted at the other end to said one end to be fixed to said engine so that said drive sprocket extends into said path for power transmitting engagement with said chain so as to drive same, and wherein said pump has a fluid inlet for connection to a fluid reservoir and a nozzle outlet,  said nozzle outlet being self supporting and directable by movement of the engine by an operator who holds the interconnected attachment and powerhead in his hands during operation.    2. the chain saw attachment of claim 1 wherein said nozzle outlet is connected to said pump by a flexible conduit member.    3. the chain saw attachment of claim 1 wherein said nozzle outlet is connected to said pump by a rigid conduit member.    4. the chain saw attachment of claim 2 or 3 wherein said fluid pump is adapted to pump liquid,  5. the chain saw attachment of claim 2 or 3 wherein said pump is adapted to pump gas.    6. in combination, a portable chain saw powerhead including an internal combustion engine and a drive sprocket and a portable chain saw attachment according to claim 1   releasabwy secured    to said chain saw powerhead.    7. in combination, a portable hand-held internal combustion engine, an attachment secured to said engine for portable operation therewith, said attachment comprising a fluid pump having a fluid inlet for connection to a fluid reservoir and a nozzle outlet, said nozzle outlet being self  supporting and directable by movement of the engine by an operator who holds the   interconneed    attachment and engine in his hands during operation.     8. a chain saw attachment substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.    9. a butterfly sprocket to be driven by a chain and to be rigidly connected to a shaft to be driven by the chain via said sprocket, said sprocket being of a general disc-shaped form from sheet metal with alternate radially extending undulating wave type troughs and peaks which are spaced angularly around the disc so that the disc has portions spaced alternately on different sides of the plane of the discs so as to form the troughs to drivingly receive portions of the chain.    10. the sprocket of claim 9 wherein the troughs are equally spaced from the claim of the disc thus locating the. chain in a fixed plane.    11. a butterfly sprocket substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
