<ABSTRACT>
a carrier wave (b) of constant amplitude and frequency,  generated by a generator (5), is modulated in multipliers (6  and 6′) by respective sinusoidal signals (ea and eb).  the  resulting modulated signals are applied to stators (la, lb) of  induction motor (1) via power amplifiers (7,7′) to drive the  motor.  the sinusoidal signals (ea, eb) are both of one  frequency, which is dependent upon the difference between  a commanded speed (ps) and actual motor speed (pn).  the  motor (1) can be driven a very low speed and is suitable for  use in a machine tool for driving a workpiece table.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of, and apparatus for, operating an induction motor this invention relates to a method of, and apparatus for, operating an induction motor. when the table of a machine tool carries a workpiece to a prescribed position, there are instances where this movement must be effected at a high speed. it is also required that the table be moved slowly at times, as when the workpiece is subjected to a slow machining operation. hence the motor which is connected to the feed shaft that moves the table ordinarily has to be capable of having its speed controlled over a very wide range, for example from 400 r.p.m. to an extremely slow speed on theorder of 0.1 r.p.m. dc motors are well suited for connecting to such feed shafts insofar as they are capable of offering such a wide range of speed control and are therefore employed to drive feed shafts in machine tools. it has become possible to ?vary the speed of an induction motor over a broad range through the utilization of variable frequency control systems, and indùction motors, which are easy to inspect and maintain, are now finding use in such applications as spindle drive motors for machine tools. however, it is not possible for an induction motor to run stably at as low a speed as a few r.p.m. or less through the use of a control system that merely reduces the operating frequency. the reason for this is as follows. the magnitude of a rotating magnetic flux which is linked to the secondary conductor of an induction motor is proportional to a voltage derived by subtracting a voltage drop, which is due to primary resistance and primary leakage reactance, from a terminal voltage applied to the primary winding of the motor. this terminal voltage becomes small at extremely low frequencies but, since voltage drop in the above-mentioned resistance and leakage reactance remains substantially constant irrespective of frequency, there is an increase in the disparity between the magnitude of the rotating magnetic flux and the terminal voltage as frequency assumes very small values. difficulties are encountered in controlling and accurately detecting the rotating magnetic flux and the secondary current which it induces in the secondary conductor. in other words, smooth and stable speed control cannot be achieved where there are fluctuations in load torque. further, while it might be possible to conceive of an arrangement in which a prescribed torque could be produced by sending a large current into the primary side of the induction motor when rotating the motor at a low speed of only a few r.p.m., the magnetic circuit of the induction motor would saturate and this would prevent the production of the desired torque. these and other problems raise doubts about the expediency of using a control system which merely reduces operating frequency to provide effective low speed control. in view of the foregoing it has not been possible to employ an induction motor in the driving of a machine tool table
