<ABSTRACT>
In an electric drive motor (1), in particular for water pumps (29) on the aquarium sector, the housing (2) is completed on all sides liquid and gas-tight and on the motor shaft (13) is sitting by the closed housing wall permanent magnetic coupling (27,28 ). In order to design this drive motor independently, so that it can be used for different aggregates, can be easily connected to these connections and is safe to it, the DIER water pump (29) facing side of the motor housing as a thin-walled membrane (9) with a planes Outdoor surface formed, which can be applied to a plane also closed membrane surface (30) of the pump housing (31), wherein in the region of the membrane (9) a fastening device for connecting the motor housing (2) with the pump housing (31) is provided. Such a motor can be easily used on the aquarium sector and use themselves under water.
