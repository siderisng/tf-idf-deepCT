<ABSTRACT>
a method of compounding a melt forming resin such as  polypropylene with mica particles having a coating of a heat-­ sensitive chlorinated hydrocarbon.  the resin is formed into  counter-rotating, parallel molten streams that contact  one another.  the coated mica particles are introduced into  this turbulence and dispensed throughout the molten resin  with shear kneading.

<DESCRIPTION>
description this invention relates to methods of compounding mica and melt forming resins. u.s. patent applications nos. 849,287 and 849,288, each filed november 7, 1977 by meyer and newman disclose that certain chlorinated aliphatic compounds can act as coupling agents for mica and certain melt forming resins. french patent 2,124,315 discloses a variety of techniques for compounding mica into an organiz polymeric matrix and suggests dispersing the mica particles in thermoplastic resin prior to attainment of processing conditions. the precise conditions under which such compounding is accomplished are quite critical. chlorinated aliphatic compounds as heat sensitive chlorinated waxes herein are subject to reduction or even elimination of beneficial effects upon undesired decomposition with heat. such decomposition is particularly acute during compounding with melt forming resin and mica particles since the mica particles act as heat sinks that are insulated by the resin during compounding and may, under conditions of high shear and mechanical heat generated thereby during intense mixing, cause compounding temperatures in excess of that which causes undesired decomposition, even though cooling is attempted. on the other hand, low temperatures during such compounding, even if attainable, can lengthen the time required for coupling agents as chlorinated waxes or other chlorinated aliphatic compounds to exhibit desired effect and consequently cause perhaps less efficient use of equipment or modification of existing equipment so as to extend periods at elevated temperature for desired properties. according to the prevent invention, there is provided a method for compounding a melt forming resin with mica particles and a heat sensitive chlorinated hydrocarbon additive which method comprises contacting a mass of molten resin with a blend of the mica and additive, the blend preferably being in the form of mica particles coated with the additive, and mixing the molten resin and the coated mica by kneading. compounding in this manner permits temperature control not otherwise easily attainable when mica particles and melt forming resin are admixed under conditions of high shear. such high shear can impart to the melt of resin and mica particles sufficient mechanical work as to generate temperature increase that is not easily controllable. kneading or low shear mixing, however, permits effective mixing of the mica and molten resin in short periods when dons in accordance with this invention so that the mica particles are not at high temperature for extended periods under shear forces that cause such uncontrollable temperature increase and consequent undesired degradation of heat sensitive additives. moreover, coipounding in accordance with this invention does not expose the mica to shear forces that undesirably break such mica thereby exposing mica surfaces without heat sensitive coupling agents. surprisingly, mica that is coated with sensitive additives may be compounded with melt forming resins as polypropylene such that the total processing time at high temperature is as little as 15 second or less and yet provide moulding precursors, e.g. pellets, which yield noulded articles with desirable properties. even still further, however, very high shear can even cause deterioration of melt forming resin to an
