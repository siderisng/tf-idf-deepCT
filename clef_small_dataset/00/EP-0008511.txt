<ABSTRACT>
a pneumatic run flat tire (1) for motorcycles having a high  handling stability during straight and zigzag runnings, corner­ ing stability and durability, even when the tire is punctured  while running and the pneumatic pressure inside of the tire  becomes equal to atmospheric pressure.  the run flat tire has a  pair of sidewall-reinforcing layers (12), each comprising an  elastic filler (13) extending from an end location adjacent a  bead core (7) in a bead portion (3) to the other end location in a  tread portion (2) through a sidewall portion (4) of the tire, the  elastic filler (13) being reinforced with at least two reinforcing  plies (14, 14a), one of which extends along one side surface of  the elastic filler toward the tread portion (2), and then, addi­ tionally extends in to the tread portion (2), and the other one of  which extends along the other side surface of the elastic filter  toward the tread portion (2), and then, additionally extends  into the tread portion (2).
