<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel general method for the construction of the hydroxyacetyl side chain of steroids of the pregnan type, according to which a corresponding steroid carbaldehyde is treated successively with formaldehyde-dimethylmercaptal-S oxide in the form of an alkali metal salt thereof, and with a highly acidic hydrolyzing agent;.Preferred process products are compounds of the formula wherein N is the number 1 or 2, R 2 methyl or difluoromethyl, and R¹ hydroxymethyl, methoxymethyl, acetoxymethyl or hydrogen and when n = 2 and / or R² is difluoromethyl, also methyl which as agonists or antagonistsThink of natural steroid hormones.Of particular interest, the antigestagen is effective 19, 21-dihydroxy-17α-pregn-4-en-3,20-dion, its 6,7-dehydroanalogue and diacetate thereof.
