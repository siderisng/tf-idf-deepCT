<ABSTRACT>
a pharmaceutical composition in solid dosage form which comprises a core including a first active ingredient and a film coating, characterised in that the film coating contains a second active ingredient.  in a preferred embodiment of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention, the core contains an iron source, in particular ferrous glycine sulphate, incorporated in controlled release matrix, and is coated with a film coating containing a vitamin, for example folic acid.  the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is preferably produced by preparing a tablet core containing an active ingredient, then preparing a film coating solution or suspension containing a second active ingredient, and spraying the solution or suspension onto the core.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a pharmaceutical coltion in solid dosage form in which active ingredients are incorporated, and to a process for its production. it is known to prepare dosage forms in which hfc or more active ingredients are incorporated in a sing* solid dosage form. there are, however, problems involved in obtaining a solid dosage form wherein b maximum therapeutic efficiency for all of the active ingredients is capable of being realised. problems may arise, for example, because of chemical incompatibilities between different active ingredients, or where differences exist in half-lives of eliminaticr. if a controlled release system is used the maximum therapeutic efficiency cannot in general be realised where the system contains two or more active ingredier.+s with different half-lives of elimination. one method which has been used in the past to overcome these disadvantages of solid dosage forms containing two or more active ingredients, has been to formulate a bi- or multi- layer tablet, each layer of which contains the required amount of one active ingredient, contained where appropriate in a controlled release system. the manufacture of these bi-layer or multi-layer tablets is difficult and time-consuming. an object of the present invention is to provide a solid dosage form in which the above disadvantages are reduced or substantially obviated. this invention therefore relates to a pharmaceutcal composition in solid dosage form which comprises a cote including a first active ingredient and a film coatings characterised in that the film coating contains a seef active ingredient. in principle, the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may contain any active ingredients, the o choice of aetive ingredients depending on the desired therapeutic effect. in a preferred ex odiment of the pharmaceutical composition according to the -invention, the two active ingredients have different half lives of elimination, the active ingredient-of the core requiring incorporation within a controlled release system due to its particular half-life of elimination and being so incorporated while the other ingredient is incorporated within the film coat. the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are particularly suitable in iron and vitamin therapy, the treatment of asthma and bronchitis and in treatment of migraine, for use in iron and vitamin therapy, the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention suitably comprise a core containing a suitable iron source, such as ferrous glycine sulphate, ferrous sulphate, ferrous succinate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate, incorporated in a controlled release matrix in order to reduce the risk- of gastro-intestinal disturbances, the core being film-coated with a coating containing the vitamin to be administered for example, folic acid, riboflavin, thiamine or pyridoxine hydrochloride. for the treatment of asthma and bronchitis, the compositions according to the invention suitably contain a core containing a bronchodilator, in particular aminophylline or theophylline, incorporated in a controlled release matrix, and film coated with a coating containing, for example, a tranquiliser such as hydroxyzine, chlordiazepoxide or chlorpromazine hydrochloride or, in particular for the treatment of asthma where instantaneous bronchodilation is required, a potentiator such as isoprenaline, isoetharine or protokylol.
