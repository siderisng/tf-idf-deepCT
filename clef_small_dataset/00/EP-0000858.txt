<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a foldable handheld for the reproduction of photographs or other documents. This apparatus consists of a U-shaped base (4) at the ends of which a support (2) for carrying a document (1) to be reproduced and a support (8) for an optical system (14) are respectively articulated. The support (8) is arranged in such a way that the optical system (14) can be adapted to the lens (11) of a photographic apparatus (12), for example a photographic device of the instantaneous development type. In the rest position the two supports (2 and 8) are folded against the base (4). In working position these two supports are deployed perpendicular to the base (4). To perform the reproduction of a document, in particular a photograph, it is sufficient to adapt the apparatus to reproduce on the object of the camera and to place the assembly thus formed on a surface at least approximately plane . This apparatus makes it possible to solve the problem of the multiple drawing of photographs in a simple way by means of an instantaneous development device.
