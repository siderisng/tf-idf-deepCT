<ABSTRACT>
a control circuit for a direct current motor in which  the armature (3) is arranged for reversible connection in  a main path for current to flow from a first supply terminal  (4) to a second supply terminal (7) through the armature  (3) and a current chopper (6).  a pair of switches (1, 2)  between which the armature (3) is connected are controllable  to effect this reversible connection in the drive mode  and to connect the armature (3) across a bridge (d1, d2,  d5, d6) to permit return current to flow from the second  terminal (7), in either direction through the armature (3)  toward the chopper (6) in a regenerative mode, one or  more diodes (d3, d4, d7; d8, d9) being provided for completing  a return path for the return current to flow to the  first terminal (4).
