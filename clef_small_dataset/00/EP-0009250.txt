<ABSTRACT>
method for preparation of free-flowing composite par­ ticles by latex over-coagulation techniques.  according to  this procedure, a dispersion is initially prepared of elasto­ mer particles.  a second dispersion is also prepared con­ taining a latex of nonelastomeric particles which have  been swollen with an appropriate solvent.  both the above  dispersion are thereupon combined whereby the swollen  nonelastomeric particles become intimately associated with  the elastomeric particles.  upon coagulation of the latex  and dispersion, intimate association of the polymer parti­ cles contained therein is achieved.  revovery of the poly­ mer particles is accomplished by filtration and the recove­ red particles ultimately dried.  the product prepared in the  above manner comprises a free-flowing mixture of (i) com­ posite predominantly elastomer particles, (ii) particles  substantially devoid of nonelastomeric materials and (iii)  particles of nonelastomeric materials.
