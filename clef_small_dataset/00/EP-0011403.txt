<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for spreading and feeding articles of flatwork  such as sheets to an ironing machine and comprising a con­ veyor over which a beam with two movable clamps is  arranged.  the clamps are adapted to grip the article at two  corners and to move apart to draw the upper edge of the  article tight.  the beam is stationary in order to simplify con­ struction.  between the beam and the conveyor is a movable  plate, onto which the upper edge of the article is transferred  and from which plate the article is transferred to the conveyor  by a movement of the plate in the moving direction of the  conveyor.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for spreading and feeding of articles of flatwork. the present invention relates to an apparatus for spreading and feeding of articles of flatwork comprising a conveyor, at the upstream end of which a beam with a pair of clamps is supported, the clamps being suited to hold a corner of an article each and to move apart until the edge of the article is tight and thereafter release the article onto the conveyor. in a known apparatus of this type the beam is adapted to be reciprocated in such a way that the article during its insertion with the corners in the clamps is freely suspended in front of the conveyor, but when released is placed over the upstream end of the conveyor. the clamps thereby perform a complex combined movement, being at first moved apart and thereafter moved in synchronization with the conveyor, over which the releasing takes place at the end of the latter movement. for this combined movement a certain amount of time is consumed in which the operator is not able to insert another article. besides, the complicated construction of the reciprocable beam and the considerable movable masses in it, it isa drawback for the operator to see the beam reciprocate just in front of him or her. it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus, in which the abovementioned drawbacks have been reduced. according to the invention the apparatus is characterized in that above the upstream end of the conveyor and below the beam a plate is arranged, said plate being reciprocable from a first position in which the upstream end of the conveyor is covered and a second position in which the interspace between the beam and the conveyor is free. during the insertion of the article in the clamps the plate is in its first position and stays in this position during the moving apart of the clamps. when the upper edge of the article is tight and the article is suspended over the edge of the plate, it is moved quickly to the second position simultaneously with the releasing of the clamps. the article will then drop partly on the conveyor and partly on the plate, the latter of which will, however, during its movement transfer and smoothe the leading edge of the article upon its delivery to the conveyor. the movement of the plate takes place with a speed, which according to the invention is substantially greater than the speed of the conveyor. thereafter, the clamps are moved together and the plate returns to its first position, and the apparatus is ready for a new cycle. as the beam is preferably stationary during this cycle, the apparatus will be more comfortable for the operator. in apparatuses of this type a pair of belts are usually provided in front of the conveyor, the outward facing parts running from the center of the apparatus to the sides. according to the invention it is preferred that the plate has
