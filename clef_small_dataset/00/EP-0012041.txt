<ABSTRACT>
a bottom board feeder apparatus for feeding bottom  boards (40) onto the top surfaces of mold boxes (22) of varying  heights.  the bottom boards (40) are supplied in succession  to the apparatus by a first conveying line (44).  the mold  boxes (22) are supplied in succession to a board receiving  position adjacent the apparatus by a second conveying line  (20).  the apparatus includes a proximity sensor (42) for  detecting the height of a mold box (22) in the board receiving  position and an elevating mechanism (124, 129, 134, 138)  responsive to the sensor (42) for raising a bottom board so  that the bottom surface of the board is at least as high as the  top surface of the box.  the apparatus also includes a shuttle  mechanism (46) for pushing the board onto the top surface of  the box after the board has been raised.  a control system  including electrical and hydraulic circuits is provided for  automatically controlling the cyclical operation of the  apparatus.
