<ABSTRACT>
transport apparatus for conveying an article through a  production line in which the article is to be subjected to  treatment by dipping.  an arm (3) holding the article (14) is  moved along a track (11) defining a closed circuit.  in order to  ensure uniform treatment of articles of different shapes and  to prevent liquids from being carried over from one dipping  bath (12) to another, means are provided for swinging the  arm (3) and for turning the arm (3) about its longitudinal axis  (x-xยน).  the production line may be a dip enamelling line.
