<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for packaging articles, in particular fibre  material compressed to bales, in heat sealable sheet material  comprises a mandrel case (1) for a row of articles to be  packaged and a transport means (3) to move these articles  stepwise to the discharge end of the mandrel (1).  further the  apparatus includes means (4,5,8 and 9) to feed at least one  web of sheet material to the mandrel case (1) and to fold this  web tube-shaped about the mandrel case.  longitudinal  sealing jaws (12) and transverse sealing jaws (17,18) are  mounted next to and in front of the mandrel case (1)  respectively to weld together overlapping longitudinal edges  and transverse edges of the tube of sheet material, a  receptacle (14) comprising clamping members (24) is  mounted adjacent the discharge end of the mandrel case (1).   this receptacle may be moved between a transverse position,  a pulling through position and a welding position.  the  mandrel case (1) takes care that before the transverse sealing  jaws (17,18) move to each other first the tube of sheet material  is pulled forwards along a sufficient distance to be able to  form the transverse end wall of the package.  besides the  mandrel case 1 avoids expansion of the material to be  packaged before it is completely closed in the package.

<DESCRIPTION>
a packaging apparatus for packaging articles in heat sealable material. the invention relates to a packaging apparatus for packaging articles in heat sealable material, in particular plastic sheet material, said apparatus comprising a substantially horizontal mandrel case for articles in line to be packaged, conveying means for stepwise conveying the articles towards the delivery end of said case, web feeding means for feeding at least one web of sheet material towards the mandrel case, folding means for folding said web about the mandrel case, longitudinal sealing means for sealing overlapping longitudinal edges of the web together and for thus forming a tube of sheet material, and transverse sealing means arranged at the delivery end of the mandrel case extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal sealing means. a similar apparatus has been described in u.s. patent specification no. 2,747,346. of common knowledge are apparatuses or machines destined for forming bags and filling the bags with particles, which known apparatuses or machines include a substantially vertical metal filling tube as well as a feeding mechanism for feeding a sheet material and folding the sheet material about said filling tube. furthermore there are known sealing jaws for adhering the overlapping edges of the sheet material to each other by sealing, as well as sealing jaws for closing the lower extremity of the of sheet material tube and pulling said tube down. as soon as a part of the tube like sheet material has been closed and the same has been pulled down over a distance corresponding to one bag a metered quantity of particles, such as peanuts or salted biscuits, are dropped into the bag through the filling tube.. the sealing jaws meanwhile returned to their starting position again cause the formation of a seal joint thereby simultaneously sealing the upper edge of the just filled bag and the lower edge of that part of the sheet tube situated just above. usually there will have been provided moreover a severing mechanism for severing the filled and completely closed bag from the tube of sheet material now closed at the lower edge. the thus severed bag will drop down for instance onto a discharge conveyor. the use of such an apparatus is restricted to packaging products that can be fed by gravity through a vertical filling tube. the known apparatus is not suitable for forming packages enwrapped with sheetlike material or relatively large blocklike bodies delivered by means of a horizontal system such as so-called bales of fibre material. in the apparatus known from the u.s. patent specification no. 2,747,346 the transverse sealing jaws will pull the tube of sheet material present on the mandrel tube forwards upon closure of said jaws in order to enable the formation of a vertical end wall. this pulling forward of the sheetlike material by means of the sealing jaws may even provoke an unchecked discharge of sheet-like material toward the sealing location whereby cracks may occur in the sheet-like material and the thus formed seal joint may be

 claims  1. a packaging apparatus for packaging articles in heat sealable material, in particular plastic sheet material, said apparatus comprising a substantially horizontal mandrel case for articles in line to be packaged, conveying means for stepwise conveying the articles towards the delivery end of said case, web feeding means for feeding at least one web of sheet material towards the mandrel case, folding means for folding said web about the mandrel case, longitudinal sealing means for sealing overlapping longitudinal edges of the web together and for thus forming a tube of sheet material, and transverse sealing jaws arranged at the delivery end of the mandrel case extending perpendicularly to said longitudinal sealing means, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t close to the delivery end of the mandrel case (1) there is provided a receptacle (14) including clamping means (24),  said receptacle being movable between a transfer position in which a packaged article may be pushed from the receptacle by means of an article pushed out of the mandrel case, a pulling through position in which an article retained within the case has been advanced over a distance corresponding to at least the height of one article, and a sealing position in which the transverse sealing jaws may cause a seal joint to be formed between parts of the tube of sheet material forced together.    2. the apparatus of claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t the receptacle is connected to at least two bars (15) the position of which may be adjusted by means of a hydraulic cylinder (16).    3. the apparatus of claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t there are provided two pairs of end sealing jaws (17,18) and in that between the jaws of one of said pairs there is provided a small knife   fr    severing the sheet material between the seal joints caused by the end sealing jaws.      4    the apparatus of claim 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t the knife is fastened to a driven chain (23) arranged between the jaws of a pair of end sealing jaws (18) and in that said pair of end sealing jaws (18) is connected to the operating  mechanism (21) in a vertically resilient condition.     5. the apparatus of anyone of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t the end sealing jaws (17,18) cooperate with a mechanism for tightening the sheet material.    6. the apparatus of claim 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d t h a t the tightening mechanism comprises two swivel bars   (31,32    part of which projects beyond the mandrel case (1), and   eac    one of said bars is connected to a sealing jaw by means of a   trans    mission (31.37, inclusive) and may be swiveled by moving the associated sealing jaw.
