<ABSTRACT>
it comprises a rotatable and retractable storage lug (50)  equipped with a rotatable and slidable weight-cylinder as足 sembly (76 and 64) in coaxial relationship with a pivoted sup足 port beam (60).  the weight-cylinder assembly (76 and 64) and  support beam (60) are connected together by a lockable  channel (70 and 70a), groove (68 and 68a) and pin (62 and  62a) arrangement.  by rotating the cylinder (64), the support  beam (60) will assume either a horizontal or working position  or a vertical or stored position.  a plurality of the lugs (50) may  be affixed, for example, to an indexing fixture (40) to enable  the fixture to be stored on a plenum assembly (16) of a nuc足 lear reactor to reduce floor storage space requirements and  downtime when the reactor is disassembled for refuelling, in足 ternal inspection and/or maintenance.
