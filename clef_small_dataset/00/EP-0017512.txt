<ABSTRACT>
polymeric materials suitable for bio-medical applica­ tions, particularly in making contact lenses, are derived by  reaction of the following monomers in the given propor­ tions:   (1) 20 to 40 mole % of a polymerisable amide which is  an unsubstituted or substituted amide of a carboxylic acid  containing olefinic unsaturation.    (2) 25 to 55 mole % of an n-vinyl lactam,   (3) 5 to 20 mole % of a polymerisable ester which is an  ester of a carboxylic acid containing olefinic unsaturation.    (4) 1 to 10 mole % of a polymerisable carboxylic acid  containing olefinic unsaturation,   (5) 3 to 10 mole % of a polymerisable hydrophobic  vinyl monomer,   the amounts of the monomers (1) to (5) totalling 100 mole %  and the copolymer being crosslinked with a crosslinking  agent.  the polymeric materials of the invention may be  machined to form contact lenses and subsequently hydrated  to form a hydrogel which is suitable for use as an extended  wear contact lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
description title "polymeric materials, process for preparing them and shaped articl-es and contact lenses formed from them." this invention relates to polymeric materials suitable for use in bio-medical applications, in particular in manufacturing contact lenses, where the materials are required to be in contact with living tissues for long periods. the requirements for polymeric materials in such applications are both precise and severe. the material needs to be fabricable without degradation, inert in a biological environment, and toxicologically inactive. in addition, the material needs to have the required chemical, physical and mechanical properties for the particular application and to be sterilisable without adversely affecting these properties. these problems are particularly acute when the material is used in the manufacture of a contact lens, especially an extended wear contact lens. in that case, the polymeric material should, as well as being optically transparent, possess four more properties of major importance. firstly, as the lens is to be considered as an extension of the cornea, it is most important that materials should be permeable to gasessuch as oxygen and carbon dioxide, since the cornea is avascular and acquires oxygen directly from the atmosphere in order-to respire. secondly, the lens should also be easily elastically deformable but recover rapidly in order to minimise disturbance on the cornea whilst avoiding visual instability. thirdly, the surface of the polymer should be hydrophilic so that the lachrymal fluid may wet the lens sufficiently to maintain a continuous tear film on the lens finally, the lensshould have a sufficient physical durability to minimise scratching, -tearing and splitting in normal, and preferably also abnormal, usage. one class of polymeric materials which can form extended wear contact lenses are those that form hydrogels when hydrated. such materials are hard and brittle generally when dray but when swollen with water they have a soft jelly-like elastic consistency. the hydrated lens has far greater compatability with the eye than a hydrophilic lens- and this feature facilitates its function as an extended wear lens. further, as an extended wear lens is to be considered as an extension of the cornea, it is desirable that the properties of the cornea should be approached as nearly as possible. if the hydrogel is to have a high oxygen permeability, it must have a high equilibrium water content when hydratxed,since the "dissolved" oxygen permeability of hydrogels has been found to increase exponentially with increasing water content. there is currently no known homopolymer which has the properties desirable for an extended wear lens material as discussed above. hence, there has been a requirement for the production of a hydrophilic copolymer having a high equilibrium water content together with the other desirable properties mentioned above. various materials have been- developed in the prior art which enable a sufficiently high water content to be reached, but such materials suffer from the disadvantage that they are of insufficient strength to be manipulable without risk of damage such as tearing. british patent specification no. 1391438 describes a copolymer comprising units derived
