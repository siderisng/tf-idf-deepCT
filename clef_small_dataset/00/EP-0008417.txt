<ABSTRACT>
the metering device consists in principle of a sealed storage container (6) for the liquid (5) to be metered, which container has at its bottom end a removal line and an aerating line (1).  the metering rate is set by the current of air which can bubble into the liquid through the aerating line.  the valve (3, 10) preferably consists of a straightforward shut-off member (open or closed) which is controlled electromagnetically or pneumatically and is fed from a generator (4) with a selectable pulse frequency and pulse duration.  <image>
