<ABSTRACT>
In the process for producing silicon inserted insulation ranges, trenches (15 to 20; 28 to 30) are etched into a silicon substrate which are all equal to and vertical walls are present, and then is thermally oxidized until the trenches (15 to 20) completely filled with silica (10, 27) and / or at least that on one side the trenches (15 to 20; 28 to 30) limiting silicon is completely converted into silicon oxide (35).With the method, for example, several differently deep insulated isolation ranges can be simultaneously produced and wide insulation portions (27, 34, 35) which are at least partially thermally grown silicon oxide (27, 35).The method is preferably used in integrated, even highly integrated and dense-packed circuits to isolate circuit elements from each other.
