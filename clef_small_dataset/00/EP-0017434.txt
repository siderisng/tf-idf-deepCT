<ABSTRACT>
a cup-shaped container is formed from a metal blank  (13) by forcing the blank (13), carried by a mandrel (50)  through a drawing die (21) to shape the blank (13) with a  base (14) and an elongate cylindrical wall (15), and ironing  dies (22,23) to thin and extend the cylindrical wall (15) along  the mandrel (50).  the mandrel (50) has circumferential a  groove (57) into which metal is caused to flow during the  ironing step and adjacent the groove (57) is a severing die  (56) which co-operates with an ironing die (23) to trim the rim  of the cylindrical wall (15) adacent the groove (57).  the  resultant container has an inner circumferential bead (60) at  the rim, which strengthens the container and reduces the  incidence of splitting.

<DESCRIPTION>
manufacture of cup-shaped containers. this invention relates to a cup-shaped container, a method of making such a container and apparatus for carrying out the method. cup-shaped containers made of metal are commonly used to make cans for containing and storing foods and liquids. there are two main types of such cans. firstly, there is the traditional three-piece can comprising a cylindrical body rolled from a sheet of metal and seamed down the side. this body is capped at one end by a separate disc-shaped base, made of sheet metal and crimped and seamed to the cylindrical body, to form a cup-shaped container. after filling of the container, the opposite end of the body is similarly capped. in recent years there has been developed a two-piece can, sometimes referred to as a "seamless11 can, wherein the body and the base are integrally formed by drawing and wall-ironing from a blank of metal, to form a one-piece cup-shaped container, which is trimmed at the rim and finally capped after filling. it is usual for such a cupshaped container to be made in three operations. a shallow cup-shaped blank is formed in a first operation from a flat blank. this shaped blank is then subjected to drawing and wall-ironing and the third operation is cutting off the rim margin with a knife to form a cup - shaped container of standard length. such cans have the advantages that leakage and consequent food contamination are less likely to occur, since seams are considerably reduced as compared with the traditional can. in addition, the two-piece cans are more aesthetically pleasing to the eye and are easier to stack end to end. a problem that arises in the manufacture of the one-piece cup-shaped containers is that longitudinal splits occasionally develop in the cylindrical wall of the container. such splits, if not detected, may result in a can which is liable to leakage and contamination of the contents. variation occurs in quality of the metal used for making cans and this problem manifests itself particularly with poorer quality metal. it has now been found that these splits begin at the rim and spread along the body wall of the cup-shaped container and it has surprisingly been discovered that the incidence of splitting can be very considerably reduced by forming an area of increased strength adjacent the rim, the-present invention provides a method of manufacturing a one-piece cup-shaped container, comprising wallironing a blank having a base and a cylindrical wall, so as to extend the length of-the cylindrical wall, forming an integral inner circumferential bead on the cylindrical wall towards the end of the wall-ironing operation, and trimming the rim of the cylindrical wall near the bead. preferably, the trimming step is effected by continuing the wall-ironing operation past a cutting edge. it has been found that the formation of this bead, which may project by only 0.06 mm for example, strengthens the rim sufficiently to reduce very considerably, the incidence of splitting of the cylindrical wall. it

claims.   1. a method of manufacturing a one-piece, cup-shaped metal container, comprising wall-ironing a pre-shaped blank having a base and a cylindrical wall, so as to extend the length of the cylindrical wall, characterised by forming an inner circumferential bead on the cylindrical wall towards the end of the wall-ironing operation, and trimming the rim of the cylindrical wall near the bead.   2. a method according to claim 1, wherein the wallironing operation is effected by relatively moving an annular ironing die and a mandrel on which the cylindrical wall is ironed, characterised in that a groove is provided around the mandrel so that material of the cylindrical wall flows into the groove to form the bead during the last part of the wall-ironing operation.   3. a method according to claim 2, characterised in that the wall-ironing operation is continued after formation of the bead past a cutting edge to effect said trimming.   4. wall-ironing apparatus for use in manufacturing a onepiece, cup-shaped, metal container from a pre-shaped blank having a base and a cylindrical wall, the apparatus comprising a mandrel   insertable    within the cylindrical wall and an annular wall-ironing die for ironing the cylindrical wall along the mandrel to extend the length of the cylindrical wall, characterised in that a circumferential groove is provided around the mandrel near the rim-forming portion of the mandrel, whereby an integral inner circumferential bead is formed on the cylindrical wall near the rim by relative movement of the mandrel and the ironing die.   5. wall-ironing apparatus according to claim 4 characterised by trimming means provided near the groove and cooperable with the wall-ironing die for trimming the rim  of the extended cylindrical wall.   6. wall-ironing apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the trimming means includes a trimming edge radially aligned with an edge of the groove, so that the bead immediately adjoins the free end of the trimmed cylindrical wall.    7. a one-piece, metal, cup-shaped container having a base and an integral elongate cylindrical wall, in which the cylindrical wall has been extended by wall-ironing and trimmed to provide a container of predetermined length, characterised in that the cylindrical wall has an integral, inner circumferential bead formed near the rim.   8. a container according to claim 7, characterised in that the bead adjoins the rim.   9. a container according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the bead has a greater axial dimension than radial dimension with respect to the cylindrical wall.   10. a container according to claim 9, characterised in that the radial dimension is 0.06 to 0.07 mm.
