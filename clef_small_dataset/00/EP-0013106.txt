<ABSTRACT>
a spur gear (44,54), according to one aspect of the inven­ tion, is formed on an axially elongated rotatable member (32)  with gear teeth (44) which extend axially and radially and are  formed each with an extension (48) which affords support for  and tapers from the corresponding tooth (44) towards the axis  of the rotatable member (32) and the root thickness of which  tapers away from the corresponding tooth (44) towards a  point.  in another aspect, the invention provides a hand tool  preferably employing the spur gear (44,54) defined as a tool  drive means and having an elongated hollow enclosure com­ prising two complementary half-shell parts (12) connected at  a common end by a hinge (80) and having respective register­ ing openings at the other end for rotatably supporting a tool  having a shaft (32) and tool drive means (44) fixed thereto,  locking means being provided to hold the shell parts (12)  together with the tool shaft (32) in the openings and the tool  drive (44) means therebetween, the half-shells (12) being  releasable by said locking means so that they can be opened  around the hinge (80) like a beak, providing space to remove  one tool and substitute another.
