<ABSTRACT>
granular activated carbon is manufactured from  briquettes formed from brown coal from which iron material  has been extracted by crushing and screening the pretreated  coal briquettes to produce granules, which are  treated by mixing with about 5% by weight of concentrated  inorganic acid (h₂so₄, h₃po₄, or hcl) without the  addition of a carbonaceous binder such as coal tar pitch.   the so treated granules are ground to form fine powder,  which powder is compressed into shapes such as pellets  and then granulated.  these granules are devolatilized,  without charring by directly heating to and at a temperature  higher than the charring temperature in an oxygen-free  atmosphere, and then activated by heating to and at  a temperature higher than the devolatilizing temperature  in an atmosphere containing a gaseous activating agent.   the activated granules have a surface area of not less  than about 900 m²/gram, an abrasion number of not less  than about 70 and an apparent density of not less than  about 0. 48 gram/cc, which properties make them suitable  for use in water and waste water treatment and in other  applications.
