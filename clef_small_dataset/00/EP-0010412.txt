<DESCRIPTION>
denture cleansing compositions. this invention relates to denture cleansing compositions intended for dissolution in an aliquot of water to develop an initial ph of 44.5. denture cleansing compositions are known and generally comprise solids compositions which produce a more or less strongly alkaline reaction on dissolution in water to form a cleansing bath. tablets have been found to be an acceptable form of presentation, facilitating dosage control both in manufacture and use, improving each of handling from a packaging point of view, and in storage. tabletted alkaline denture cleansing compositions clean dentures but do not completely remove accumulations of calculus or tartar. known acid-reacting compositions, such as those containing hydrochloric acid, remove calculus or tartar but such compositions cannot be tabletted, require special handling and packaging, and are inconvenient in use so that their application to denture cleansing compositions generates many problems in both manufacture and use. thus, no strongly acidreacting denture cleansing tablet has yet been successfully marketed. austrian patent specification no. 264015 suggests the preparation of mixtures capable of dissolving in water to form a cleansing solution having an initial ph #5, preferably ph 1.5 - 4.5 and containing inter alia monopotassium permonosulphate, a carbonate of sodium and an acid reacting substance including sodium bisulphate or a fruit acid. further it is proposed that certain of such mixtures be formed into tablets for dissolution in water to form a denture cleansing bath and suggested that the tablets may dissolve within 7 minutes. the disclosure in austrian patent specification no. 264015 does not however suggest how the mixtures are to be handled,and, more particularly, how the tablets are to be made on a commercial scale. indeed the moisture content of the suggested components produce tablets which are not storage stable and the tablets take an inordinately long time to dissolve. further, whilst tablets may be succesfully produced by hand in accordance with the prior disclosure such processing is not commercially viable and does not produce a fast-dissolving tablet which can effectively remove calculus and generally clean dentures within ten minutes, a period to which the public has now become accustomed. the invention as claimed is intended to provide a denture cleansing composition, conveniently in tablet form, and which, on dissolution in an aliquot of water, produces an acid-reacting bath having an initial ph of #4.5. the present invention thus provides an anhydrous denture cleansing composition having a free surface moisture content less than 0.5%, for dissolution in water to form a denture cleansing bath, comprising 10% to 40% by weight of at least one permonosulphate of formula múhso5 wherein mú is an alkali metal cation, a tartar removal component consisting of at least one bisulphate of formula wêhso wherein 2 is an 4 alkali metal cation, and/cr a fruit acid selected from the group consisting of succinic acid, malic.acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and mixtures of such acids, and at least one substantially chloride-free anhydrous alkali metal carbonate of formula m2 co3 wherein m is an alkali metal cation,
