<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for feeding dough moulding composition to the barrel of an extruder or injection moulding machine comprises a reservoir having means therein to urge moulding composition from said reservoir to said barrel, a channel connecting said reservoir and barrel, said channel having a variable volume portion and isolating valve means for closing the channel between the reservoir and said variable volume portion so that when said channel is open, moulding material flowing through the channel to the barrel will at least partly expand said portion so as to store moulding material therein, the arrangement being such that on closing said isolating valve means and contracting said variable volume portion, the flow of moulding composition to the barrel is maintained from said portion for at least as long as is necessary to replenish the reservoir.
