<ABSTRACT>
the amount of fluid expanding through the orifice (126)  of a cryostat is controlled by a valve member (130).  both the  orifice and the valve member are provided with respective  control members (148, 150) which have mean coefficients of  expansion which differ by at least 1 x 10⁻⁵(°k⁻¹) and are  arranged so that as the temperature of the cryostat rises the  valve member moves to open the orifice whilst as the  temperature falls the valve member moves to restrict the  orifice.  relative movement between first and second control  elements is confined to an area remote from the warm end of  the cryostat.
