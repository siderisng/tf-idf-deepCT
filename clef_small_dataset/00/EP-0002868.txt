<ABSTRACT>
fire detector comprising fire sensing means and  switching means short-circuiting the lines in the case of a  fire which is so constructed that a large alarm current  flowing through the detector once operated by a fire is  promptly reduced to a small current, and the line voltage  to which the detectors are connected is promptly returned  from a voltage nearly equal to the short-circuit voltage to  the normal voltage.  accordingly, even if fire detectors connected  to plural detector lines are operated successively,  there is no possibility of coming short of the capacity of  the power source in the control panel, or even after a detector  in a detector line has been operated, fire detection  by another detector connected in the same detector line is  still possible.
