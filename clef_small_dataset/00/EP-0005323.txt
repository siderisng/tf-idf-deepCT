<ABSTRACT>
metal may be recovered from metal chlorides, for  example a mixed metal chloride residue from the fluidised  bed chlorination of a titaniferous ore in the presence of  carbon to produce titanium tetrachloride by heating, in  the presence of a scavenging agent, which may comprise  a combination of titanium dioxide and carbon inherently  present in a residue from the afroesaid fluidised bed  chlorination process, to at least 1500°c and preferably to  a temperature at which iron present is liquid.  if the temperature  is maintained at below 2200°c iron, vanadium  and niobium may be recovered preferentially to certain  lower value metals which remain in the form of chlorides  giving the possibility for the recovery to a high value mixed  metal product.  titanium trichloride may be formed and  this may be chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride thereby  increasing the efficiency of the original chlorination process.
