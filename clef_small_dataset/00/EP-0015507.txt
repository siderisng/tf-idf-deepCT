<ABSTRACT>
an entrapment prevention device for ensuring that  people or obstacles do not become trapped in the path of  automatic doors, windows and the like features an elongate  sensor which can be fitted along an edge of an opening or  of a closure member adapted to close the opening.  the  sensor features a pair (11) of electrically conductive bands  (13) and (14) which are held spaced apart and facing each  other by insulating strips (17) with the pair of bands being  wound in helical form round a core (17) to form an elongate  structure.  a series of transverse slots (15) are provided in  the surface of the radially outer band (14) so that the  remaining web portions (16) can be easily deflected by light  contact pressure to electrically contact the radially inner  band (13).  this electrical contact is sensed by a monitoring  circuit (24) which energizes a relay (26) to stop or reverse  the automatic drive.  the pair of bands (11) is surrounded by  an outer helically wound resilient cushion (18) and is  enclosed in a continuous outer sleeve (19).
