<ABSTRACT>
a photographic film assemblage (10) of the self-developing  type is specially configured for use in conventional  cameras including those of the 35 mm type.  photographic  processing apparatus (11) is provided for use in conjunction  with the self-developing type film assemblages (10)  which have been previously exposed by the conventional  type camera.  the film assemblages (10) comprise a substantially  lighttight cartridge (34) into which the film strip may be  rewound subsequent to exposure in the conventional type  camera thereby facilitating its removal from the camera and  its insertion into the processing apparatus (11) which operates  again to withdraw the film strip from its cartridge so as to  effect the processing of the film strip.  after processing, the  film strip is advanced from the processing apparatus to provide  a plurality of fully developed transparencies which may  be cut and framed in a conventional manner.
