<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector comprising a female housing (13)  and at least one latching member (12) having a catch (32) at  one end and an ejection abutment (39) at the other end.  the  latching member (121 is generally u-shaped having a pair of  legs (31) extending in spaced relation in the same direction  from the one end and is releasably mounted straddling the  female housing (13) by studs (38) which are formed projecting  towards each other on the tree ends of the legs (31) being  received in apertures (15) provided in the side walls (16) of the  female housing (13).  pivotal movement of the latching  member (12) about the studs (38) away from the latching  osition in which the catch retains a mating male connector  (21) causes a cam portion (39) of each stud (38) to eject the  male connector (21) from the female housing (13).  the catch  (32) may be mounted between the arms (31) on a resilient  member (34, 36) flexible in the release direction.
