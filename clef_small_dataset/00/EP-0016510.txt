<ABSTRACT>
this invention concerns injection guns, particularly for  pressurised application of material from a container coupled  to a ram of the gun.  a coupling between the ram 11 and the container 12 is  proposed that is comprised of three coaxial parts 21, 22, 23  that are relatively axially movable over a region of mutual  overlap whereat, during such relative axial movement, an  interlocking part or parts, such as balls 24, transfers between  interlocking together of one pair of coaxial parts and interlockÂ­ ing together of another pair of coaxial parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: injection guns d:escrip?ion the invention relates to injection guns. injection guns are used for pressurised application of sealing compounds into joints or plugs. such guns have a conventional principle of operation where a barrel or other container for sealing compound is acted upon by an hydraulic ram to apply pressure to the material and force it out of a nozzle communicating with the barrel or other container. clearly, there must be a way of refilling or replacing the barrel or other container and we have, hitherto, had a screwed retaining ring to couple the barrel to the ram. it is an object of one aspect of this invention to provide a coupling that is much more readily and quickly released and re-engaged. accordingly this invention proposes that a coupling between a ram and a container for material to be pressurised by the ram be comprised of three coaxial parts that are relatively axially movable over a region of mutual overlap whereat, during such relative axial movement, an interlocking part or parts transfers between interlocking together of one pair of the coaxial parts and interlocking together of another pair of the coaxial parts. in preferred embodiments, the interlocking parts, preferably balls, are movable transversely of said axis between seatings in inner and outer ones of the coaxial parts, but always engaged in passages through a middle one of the coaxial parts. conveniently, of course, the inner and middle parts are each secured rigidly to, or comprise a part of, a different one of the ram and the container, with the outer coaxial part limited in its relative axial movement by mutual abutments with the middle part. another mutual stop between the inner and middle coaxial parts can serve to limit bringing of the two together on coupling. using balls as the interlocking parts, the middle coaxial part may be a ball cage of less thickness than the ball diameter and the seatings may be arcuate section grooves matching and accommodating portions of the outer ball circumference. another point concerning injection guns with rams and containers pressurised thereby is that, at the time of recharging, the ram will be at maximum extension and may not be readily retracted prior to decoupling of the ram and container, which is preferred for recharging by cartridges inserted from the coupling end. accordingly this invention proposes-that'a communication with the ram cylinder be alternatively vented and connected to an inlet for compressed gas to retract the ram according to the position of a part or parts of a releasable coupling between the ram and the container to be pressurised thereby. conveniently, venting is automatic on engagement of the coupling and pressurisation is also automatic from and only after an initial or intermediate stage of decoupling. this is particularly readily and advantageously achieved using a coupling hereof where a middle one of its three coaxial parts permanently offers through-communication to a cylinder vent, and an outer one of the coaxial parts has the gas inlet and alternatively
