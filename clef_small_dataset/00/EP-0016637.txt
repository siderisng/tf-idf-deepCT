<ABSTRACT>
a high impedance tap for use in distributed signal  transmission systems, comprising microstrip circuit (100)  which has conductor strips (101 and 103), located on an  insulating substrate (102) and interconnecting the connec­ tors (105).  the substrate (102) also carries at least some of  the high impedance components of the branch line.  the new tap design eliminates some of the random  factors which, in prior art taps, led to unsatisfactory match­ ing of those taps to the transmission line.  the specification also discloses a transceiver circuit for  use with the tap and capable of receiving and transmitting  low-level serial phase-modulated tri-state signals; and the  configuration of a bus access module.

<DESCRIPTION>
passive electric tap the present invention relates to passive electric taps, and to transceiver circuits for use therewith. in distributed systems such as, e.g., distributed data processing systems, it is generally desirable to have a minimum of point-to-point wiring compatible with optimum data communications and maximum flexibility, between an often large number of geographically and functionally distinct users. this may be achieved by a bus-like transmission line, the required numerous user connections to the signal transmission line being made via passive taps. however, as the number of users increases, and with it the number of taps, problems associated with loading and reflections on the transmission line arise which may affect the integrity of data and control information being transmitted and received over the transmission line. conventional passive taps comprise a short length of transmission cable, terminating at each end in an appropriate connector through which it can be connected in series with the signal transmission line, the branch conductors leading to the users being soldered to the conductors of the cable. by choosing a length of cable having impedance characteristics similar to those of the transmission line, a fair impedance match is usually possible. the matching does, however, depend on some factors which are not easily controlled in practice such as, inter alia, the amount of insulation stripped off, the relative positions of the bared conductors of the transmission cable and the branch line conductors, and the like. the present invention provides a tap design which eliminates some of the random factors inherent in prior art taps and moreover, allows the impedance of the tap to be tailored to match that of the transmission line more closely, resulting in reduced reflections and loading. this is achieved by arranging for a substantially fixed spatial relationship between the conductors of the primary path, which is connected in series with the transmission line, and between the primary path and at least some high impedance components of the secondary path or branch connection. in a practical embodiment, the tap may comprise a pair of connectors, compatible with the transmission line being used, and a microstrip circuit having an insulating substrate with suitably arranged conducting strips on both faces, and a plurality of plated-through holes. selected high impedance components of the secondary path are mounted on the substrate to minimize interconnection distances; and the physical dimensions and the layout are chosen -to match the impedance characteristics of the transmission line and to minimize the reflectionproducing discontinuities. the minimization of reflections and loading at each tap is most critical, of course, when the signal level- is relatively low and a maximum number of taps is required. the performance of a tap is, to- some extent, determined also by the nature of the circuitry connected to the tap, and the present invention therefore further provides a transceiver particularly suitable for the reception and transmission of phase modulated signals via a passive tap. the transceiver is connected to, and its input and output circuits form part of, the

 claims   1. a passive tap for a signal transmission line, comprising a primary signal path arranged to be connected in series with the transmission line and having impedance characteristics substantially matching those of the transmission line, and a secondary signal path connected in parallel with, and presenting a high impedance to, the primary path, characterised in that the primary path comprises two strip conductors (101, 103) carried on and separated by an insulating substrate (102) which also   carries    connectors (105) included in the primary path for said series connection and at least some high impedance components (r1, r3) of the secondary path.   2. a passive tap according to claim 1 wherein the secondary path includes a network   (d1    d2, d3, d4) arranged to conduct when the applied signal exceeds a predetermined magnitude during signal transmission to the primary path (101, 103, 105), and to be non-conducting when the signal level is below that threshold during signal reception from the primary path (101, 103, 105).   3. a passive tap as claimed in claim 2 wherein the network comprises two antiparallel branches of two or more series connected diodes (d1, d2, and d3, d4) each, located on said insulating substrate (102).   4. a passive tap as claimed in- claim 2 or claim 3, in which the network (d1, d2, d3, d4) is connected in series with the secondary winding of a transformer to form the output circuit of a transmitter portion of a signal transceiver, and in which an input circuit of the transceiver comprises two matched high resistance voltage dividers (r1, r2 and r3, r4) connected in parallel with the output circuit.    5. a passive tap as claimed in claim 4 wherein the signal transceiver  coupled to the secondary current path is selectively operable in a receive  mode or a transmit mode for receiving or transmitting serial phase-modulated signals and comprises a threshold detector (12) to detect when a received signal exceeds a preselected threshold and to produce a control signal in response thereto, a signal detector (27) coupled to the threshold detector (12) and arranged to produce a data signal in response to predetermined polarity changes in the received signal, and a lockout circuit (35) which holds the data and control signals at a preset level during operation of the transceiver in the transmit mode to render the receiver circuitry unresponsive to the transmitted signals.
