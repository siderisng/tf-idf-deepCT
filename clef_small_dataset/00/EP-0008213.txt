<ABSTRACT>
a liquid polymeric composition comprises a suspen­ sion in an organic liquid of particulate water insoluble but  water swellable polymer, the particles being less than 10  microns in size.  to reduce viscosity in water the swellable  polymer may be a copolymer and/or a water soluble poly­ mer may be included.  a composition of polymer particles  that are swellabie and contain both soluble and insoluble  polymer can be made by inverse emulsion polymerisation.   an aqueous adhesive, that may be made by mixing this  composition with water, comprises water swollen particu­ late polymer that may be a copolymer and that may be  used with a dissolved polymer in order to reduce the visco­ sity.  pregummed substrates, such as wallpaper, that can  be rendered adhesive by contacting with water are obtai­ ned by applying the aqueous or non-aqueous composition  to the substrate and drying it on the substrate.  wallcover­ ing can be stuck to a surface using the aqueous adhesive.
