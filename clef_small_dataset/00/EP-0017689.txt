<ABSTRACT>
a positive clutch power shift transmission, more parti足 cularly for a land vehicle which is readily synchronized and  power shifted during upshifting and downshifting, has an  input shaft (16) driven by a torque converter (not shown),  a countershaft in continuous driving relation with the input  shaft, an output shaft (20) having first (86), second (170),  and third (172) speed ratio gears journalled thereon and  driven via the countershaft, a reverse speed ratio gear (168)  splined to the output shaft and driven via a gear on an idler  shaft driven by the countershaft, a first friction clutch (84)  mechanism for connecting the first speed ratio gear to the  output shaft, a second friction clutch mechanism (82) for  connecting the output shaft directly to the input shaft, a  blocker-clutch assembly (30) for coupling the second and  third speed ratio gears to the output shaft, and an actua足 tor assembly (32) for shifting the blocker-clutch assembly  into and out of coupling engagement.  the friction clutches  (84, 82) are momentarily engageable to relieve driving and  coast mode torque on the blocker-clutch and to synchro足 nize the blocker-clutch.  in an alternative embodiment a  torque converter driven shaft drives the countershaft and  a torque converter bypass shaft which is connected direct足 ly to the output shaft (20) via the second friction clutch  mechanism (82).
