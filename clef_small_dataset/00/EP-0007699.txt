<ABSTRACT>
wire stripping apparatus is described (figure 1) in which  movement of a lever handle 18 towards a second handle 12  causes an actuator plate 50 to shift laterally so as to cam  displace gripping jaw 14 towards the second gripping jaw 10.   cutting jaws 28 30 are provided between the gripping jaws to  penetrate the sheath of the cable.  when the cable is firmly  gripped and the sheath penetrated, the vectorial force applied  by the inclined link 54 displaces the actuator axially (arrow b)  to move the cutting jaws relative to the gripping jaws and strip  the severed portion of the sheath along the core of the cable.   the actuator undergoes a complex lateral and axial move­ ment dependent upon the parameters of the cable being tre­ ated and by virtue of the triangular slot 56 in the actuator thus  enabling the extent of lateral movement before commence­ ment of axial movement to vary according to the cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
descriptioij apparatus for wire strippii:g this invention relates to apparatus for wire stripping, that is to say for cutting and/or tearing the sheath or covering of a conductor wire, cable or the like, and displacing the cut or torn portion along the cable. the term "core" will be used in this specification to mean wire or inner part, the term "sheath" to mean the insulation or other covering surrounding the core, and the word "cable" will be used herein to refer to the combination of core and sheatb. the apparatus to which the invention relates may be hand operated or power operated. it is known for example in uk patent 1164184 to provide an outer pair of jaws which can be closed together to grip the sheath, and an inner pair of jaws which are closed by the movement of the outer jaws to cut the sheath. the two pairs of jaws are relatively displaced along the cable so as to displace the cut sheath portion or tear the sheath and displace the severed portion along the core. in the said patent, a lever handle is connected by a three link toggle mechanism which is urged by a spring, so that initial lever movement displaces two of the toggle links and causes jaw closing. when further closing of the jaws is resisted by the sheath, and the resistance is sufficicnt for the spring to be overcome, a different pair of the links acts as a toggle mechanism to cause the displacement. in practice, it can be anticipated that anyone apparatus will need to operate on a range of cables which vary in respect of overall diameter, that is sheath diameter (or thickness, if not circular) the ratio of sheath diameter or thickness to core thickness, and in relation to sheath hardness or compressibility. the said apparatus of patent 1164184 can cope with a wide range of different cables because the transition point between jaw closing and relative jaw displacenent is deternined by resistance to further closing of the jaws, and if the jaws close more or less, the transition point comes at a different position in the movement of the lever. adjustment to deal with different sheaths/core ratios can be provided by adjustment means which effectively vary the gap between the inner jaws relative to the gap between the outer jaws. however, the spring which effectively prevents the displacing movement until after the transition point is an essential element and the efficiency of the apparatus depends to a large extent upon the spring being manufactured within fine tolerances. patent 1515368 provides a rather different apparatus for the same purposes, where a cam is symmetrically disposed between the two gripping jaws and is displaceable along the axis of the cable so that as the can passes between cam followers provided on the jaws it automatically pivots them to close them and grip the cable. the cam is connected to the cutting jaws with a lost motion device, so that the pivotal

    claifis      1. apparatus for wire stripping comprising inner cutting jaws   (2r,30)    located between outer gripping   jaws    (10, 14), a lever (18) mechanism for closing the jaws, and an actuator (50) coupled to the cutting   j8ws    so that movement of the actuator generally along the axis (e) of the cable displaces the cutting jaws, the actuator providing a cam for at least closing the gripping jaws, characterised in that the actuator is arranged for lateral movement (a) as well as movement along the direction of the cable axis, and the lever mechanism includes a link (54) for initially causing actuator can movement to close the jaws and after a transition point allowing the cam to move relative to the jaws for the following jaw displacement.   2. apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said link (54) is pivoted at each end to the lever (18) and to the actuator respectively, and is inclined at an angle to the axis of the cable at all times, so that vector components of force applied in lever movement will urge and displace the actuator laterally   (at    the beginning of the lever movement) thus moving the   can.    laterally with the one gripping jaw to   commence    the jaw closing   movement,    and move the actuator alono said axis so as to move the cam relative to the one gripping jaw subsequently.     3. apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein the actuator is in   the    form of a plate coupled to   tese    inner jaws (28,30) by a slot (56) engaging a pin (32) with lost notion between the two possible in   two    directions.   4. apparatus as claimed in claim 3   herein    the plate is constrained in position by its pivot to the link, and the can comprises a slot (58) and the pivoted jaw (14) is provided with a roller (62) engaged in the cam slot.   5. apparatus as   claimed    in claim 4 wherein the actuator is provided with a tail (60) extending generally in the direction of the axis of the cable (b) and a loose guide (80) is provided for the tail.   6. apparatus as claimed in claim 3 wherein the slot is generally triangular (56) and the cutting jaws (28, 30) are hinged together on a pin (32) extending through said slot.   7. apparatus as claimed in claim 4 wherein the can slot includes a parallel straight sided portion extending to a further can portion arranged so that the gripping jaws (10,14) are positively moved to an open position when the roller reaches the said further cam portion.    8. apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein the apparatus comprises a body (12) forming a second lever handle provided with an abutment roller (70) which serves to limit lateral displacement of the actuator and facilitate axial displacement of the actuator.   9. apparatus as claimed in claim 1 provided with detachable and   intercliangeable    cutting jaws   (28,30).        10. apparatus as   claimed    in claim 1 provided with detachable and   interchangeable    gripping jaws (186).   11. apparatus as clained in claim 1 provided with scissor like cutting jaws (38,40), one of which is fixed to the main body of the apparatus   ana    the other of which is movable   with    said lever   (18).
