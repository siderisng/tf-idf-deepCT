<ABSTRACT>
a monolithic darlington in which the transistors (qa and  qb) forming the darlington pair are formed on a substrate  together with a fourth terminal (4) in addition to the normal  three terminals (1,2 and 3) provided for a darlington pair, the  fourth terminal (4) being connected to the base electrode of  the second transistor (qb) and the emitter electrode of the first  transistor (qa).  the addition of the fourth terminal (4) enables  a control circuit consisting of a zener diode (z) and a capacitor  (c) in parallel with the zener diode (z) and a resistor (r3) con­ nected in series with the parallel combination to be connected  between the first terminal (1) and the fourth terminal (4).  this  control circuit controls the rate of switch off of the darlingion  pair and also removes the effect which the stored charge on  the base electrode of the first transistor (qa) has on the switch­ ing rate, thus enabling a faster switching rate to be achieved.
