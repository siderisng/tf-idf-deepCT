<ABSTRACT>
a foundry molding system for molding and closing cope  and drag molds includes a linear idler molding line conveyor  adjacent a cooling conveyor.  short powered sections are pro­ vided at each end of the molding line conveyor (20) for set-off  from the cooling conveyor to form the assembled cope and  drag flasks into horizontally abutting drag and cope sets on  the molding line conveyor (20) and for closing and setting on  the cooling conveyor the assembled cope and drag molds.   reciprocating index and control means are provided at each  end of the molding line conveyor (20) for indexing the sets  therealong in abutting relationship.  powered roller detents or  locators are provided along the conveyor to hold the flasks to  separate, center and retain the flasks for a variety of opera­ tions such as set-down, molding (34), drag rollover (37), cor­ ing, closing and set-on.  the roller detents at the drag rollover  (37) are located in the trunnions of the rollover for operation  therewith.  both cope and drag flasks are constructed to coop­ erate with the rollers of the detents.
