<ABSTRACT>
projectile launching and receiving apparatus for a pneu­ matic loom in which filling picks are inserted from an outside  supply source by a pneumatically launched projectile com­ prises a housing (16) having an inner opening (17) at one end  and an outer opening (24) at the opposite end.  a projectile re­ ceiving bore (18) extends axially from the inner opening (17)  and a pressure chamber (20) is connected to the bore (18) for  launching the projectile.  a passageway (22) is provided for gu­ iding the filling yarn (f) from the outer opening (24) to the bore  (18).  valve means (38) are provided for blocking the passage­ way (22) between the outer opening and the pressure cham­ ber (20) to prevent filing yarn from being blown towards the  outer opening.
