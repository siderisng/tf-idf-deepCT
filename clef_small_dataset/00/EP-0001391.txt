<ABSTRACT>
A device for cooling endless profiles has the shape of a double-walled tube. The annular space is filled with coolant, the endless profile passes through the core pipe. The evaporated coolant is also passed into the core pipe and contributes to the cooling of the end profile. The core pipe must have a sufficiently large cross-section to allow the passage of endless profiles with large transverse sections. However, endless profiles with a small cross section are poorly cooled because less coolant evaporates and this small amount of gas flows through the large, free-blowing cross-section between endless profile and core tube with low speed. In order to achieve a uniform cooling effect for endless profiles with different cross-sections, the core tube (1) has a cross section adapted to the cross section of the endless profile (7) to be cooled and is made of exchangeable in the jacket tube (3). In the vicinity of the inlet opening (13) at least one blowing opening (11) for the supply of the vaporized gas in the intermediate space formed by the core tube and endless profile is seen before. The injection openings may be formed as adjustable nozzles.
