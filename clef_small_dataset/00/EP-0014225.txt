<ABSTRACT>
olefins are converted to alcohols by a one-step, hyd­ roformylation process comprising contacting an olefin, such  as 1-hexene, with a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and  hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst prepared by loading a  bimetallic cluster of the formula: rhxcoyco₁₂ wherein both x  and y are each integers of 1-3 with the proviso that σ(x + y) =  4, onto an amine resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
pjiine-resin supported rhodium-cobalt bjrets.llic clusters as novel hydroformylation catalysts this invention relates to multinuclear metal catalysts. in one aspect, the invention relates to said catalysts supported by an amine resin in other aspects, the invention relates to a method of preparing and to various methods of employing these supported catalysts. the art-recognized method (i) of preparing alcohols from olefins is a two-step oxo, or htdrofor- mylation, process: emi1.1 the first step comprises contacting at elevated temperature and pressure, e.g., 125 c-175 c and about 3000-50c0 psi (212-353 kg/cm2), an olefin vith synthesis gas (a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) in the presence of an oxo catalyst to produce a mixture of aldehydes. these aldehydes are then hydrogenated (typically in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst) in a second step to their corresponding alcohols. cobalt and rhodium are frequently used as the oxo catalysts. reported efforts to convert this two-step process to a highly selective one-step process have been singularly unsuccessful. slaugh et al., j. organometal. chem., 13, 469 (1968), teach that a catalyst comprising cobalt carbonyl and a modifying ligand of tributyl phosphine affords a one-step, oxo synthesis of alcohols but accompanying olefin hydrogenation reduces yields (77 percent alcohol). jurewicz et al., adv. chem. ser., 132, 240-51 (1974) and rollmann et al., ger. 2,357,645, teach, respectively, that rhodium carbonyl supported on an amine resin or in the presence of tertiary amines also catalyzes a one-step oxo synthesis of alcohols. however, both research teams report suppressed yields (about 28 percent alcohol). the defects of the prior art have been substantially overcome by the present invention, which is a catalyst comprising a rhodium-cobalt carbonyl bimetallic cluster supported on an amine resin. the present invention is also directed to a method for preparing the rhodium-cobalt carbonyl catalyst. the present invention also includes a one-step oxo process for converting olefins to alcohols, the process comprising reacting the olefin with a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at a temperature of at least 500c and a pressure of at least 500 psi (35.3 kg/cm2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of a catalyst consisting of a rhodium-cobalt bimetallic cluster supported on an amine resin. these catalysts are both easily prepared (by reacting the bimetallic cluster with an amine resin in an inert liquid medium) and exhibit long life. also, these catalysts are highly selective in that alcohols are produced in essentially quantitative yield and permit the oxo process to be conducted at less rigorous process conditions. the supported catalysts here used are prepared by loading onto an amine resin a bimetallic cluster of the formula: rhxcoy12 (11) wherein x and y are each integers of 1-3 and x + y = 4. these bimetallic clusters are tetranuclear carbons and are readily synthesized by any number of varying methods. for example, tetranuclear carbonyl rh2co2(co)12 can b prepared by either of the following methods (iii, iv): emi3.1 <tb> zn[co(co)4]2 <sep> + <sep> rh2(co)4c12 <sep> mm)ene <sep> rh2co2(co)12 <sep> + <sep> znc12 <tb> <sep>
