<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention the invention relates to the catalytic homopolymerization and copolymerization of ethylene with high activity mg and ti containing complex catalysts in a low pressure gas phase process to produce polymers having a density of about 7 0.95 to f 0.97, a melt flow ratio of about > 22 to c 32 and having a relatively round particle shape and a relatively low level of fines. description of the prior art ethylene homopolymers having a density of > 0.96 and a melt index in the range of about 5 to 50 are useful for injection molding purposes requiring excellent impact strength properties provided that they have a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. ethylene polymers having a density of > 0.96 and a melt index of c 20 can be made with the catalysts and low pressure gas phase processes described in u.s. patents 3,023,203; 4,003,712 and 3,709,853. the polymers made with the supported chromium oxide, silylchromate and chromocene catalysts, however, have a relatively broad molecular weight distribution as evidenced by melt flow ratio values of 235. the polymers of these patents, therefore, have relatively limited use for injection molding applications requiring excellent impact strength properties. it is desirable therefore, to provide catalysts which would enable one to readily prepare, in a gas phase process, ethylene polymers which have a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. to be commercially useful in a gas phase process, such as the fluid bed process of u.s patents 3,709,853; 4,003,712 and 4,011,382, and canadian patent 991,798 and belgian patent 839,380, the catalyst employed must be a high activity catalyst, that is, it must have a level of productivity of 2 50,000, preferably > 100,000, pounds of polymer per pound of primary metal in the catalyst. this is so because such gas phase processes usually do not employ any catalyst residue removing procedures. thus, the catalyst residue in the polymer must be so small that it can be left in the polymer without causing any undue problems in the hands of the resin fabricator and/or ultimate consumer. low catalyst residue contents are also important where the catalyst is made with chlorine containing materials such as the titanium, magnesium and/or aluminum chlorides used in some so-called ziegler or ziegier-natta catalysts. high residual chlorine values in a molding resin will cause pitting and corrosion on the metal surfaces of the molding devices. cl residues of the order of 2 200 ppm are not commercially useful. u.s. patent 3,989,881 discloses the use of a high activity catalyst for the manufacture, under slurry polymerization conditions, of ethylene polymers having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (mw/mn) of about 2.7 to 3.1. attempts were made to use catalysts similar to those described in u.s. 3,989,881 for the purpose of making polyethylene of narrow molecular weight distribution by polymerizing ethylene alone or with propylene in the gas phase in a fluid bed process using apparatus and conditions similar to those employed in u.s. 4,011,382 and belgian patent 839,380. these attempts
