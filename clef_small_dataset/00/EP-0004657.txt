<ABSTRACT>
A video signal recording in tape longitudinal traces of successive video information scenes coming from a video signal source, e.g. b. From a video camera, it is done so that the recorded scenes are reproduced without synchronization errors and losses. In such a recording arrangement, the recording tape is delayed at the end of a scene to a standstill and then reset a predetermined time or distance. When the camera is pressed over the next time, the tape transport is accelerated to the recording speed and the video signal source is synchronized as soon as possible via synchronizing signals scanned from the tape before the recording array is switched into the recording operation for the next scene. Various control circuits ensure synchronization between tape transport and suitable synchronizing signals. The control of the entire arrangement takes place via a conventional switching log system or a microprocessor. The object of the invention is usable at each band-shaped recording medium with longitudinal track recording, especially in a magnetic tape drive according to the high-speed principle.
