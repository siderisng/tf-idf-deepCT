<ABSTRACT>
a brake comprising a brake lining secured to a backing  which is mounted in a carrier (10) and is slidable forwards and  backwards along a guideway (11) in the carrier into and out of  a working position in which it can be locked.  to avoid putting a low-friction lining in a brake intended  to operate with a high-friction lining, or vice-versa, the carrier  (10) for the brake lining-and-backing unit is provided with a  protuberance (14) at the closed end (13) of the carrier guideÂ­ way (11).  this registers with a cutaway portion of the forward  end of the backing when the backing is in its working position;  and although allowing insertion into the guideway (11) of a  non-cutaway backing, the protuberance (14) prevents such a  backing from being slid into the working position and locked  there.

<DESCRIPTION>
ssrth2s this invention relates to brakes, and more particularly to that kind of brake which comprises a brake lining secured to a backing which is mounted in a carrier and is slidable forwards and backwards along a guideway in the carrier into and out of a working position in which it can be locked. brakes of the kind just described are used in rail vehicle brake systems, but are in principle usable in other systems, for example brake systems for road vehicles, including heavy goods vehicles. when a lining has become worn or otherwise defective, then by releasing the lock the backing can be slid backwards along the guideway and so quickly withdrawn, with the lining secured to it, from engagement with the carrier; quick replacement of a fresh liningand-backing unit is thus facilitated. where, however (as on the continent), a given rail brake system requires a lining of a particular degree of friction ('high friction' or 'low friction'), then great care has to be taken that the fresh unit is of the right friction type; for the dimensions of each type are in substance identical. one proposal intended to avoid the possibility of error during replacement is disclosed in u.k. specification 1 493 062 and entails the use of a peg adjacent the entrance to the carrier guideway and offset from its longitudinal axis, and a groove in the backing for co-operation with the peg thus, if it is intended that a carrier should be fitted only with a high-friction lining, then only that type of lining (or its backing, rather) would be provided with the co-operating groove, so that only that backing would be insertable into the guideway. ilowever, the provision of a groove in the backing involves extensive cutting, both of the metal of the backing and the organic material of the brake lining, and it is desirable to avoid such operations or at least reduce their extent. the present invention provides a construction which dispenses with a groove in the backing for co-operation with a peg in order to prevent insertion of a backing not carrying the appropriate groove. instead, the invention accepts for example that a low-friction backing may be inserted and slid forwards along the guideway of a carrier intended to operate only with a high friction lining, but prevents such a backing from assuming a working position and so makes it impossible for the locking means to be operated. if a maintenance man finds that he cannot lock the backing into working position, he will at once appreciate that he has put the wrong one in and can immediately withdraw it from the guideway. according to the invention the carrier guideway has at its closed end a protuberance which registers with a cutaway portion of the forward end of the backing when the backing is in its working position. the protuberance thus allows the backing to be slid into working position, but prevents the sliding into working position of a backing whose forward

claims:   1. a brake comprising a brake lining   (1) secured    to  a backing (2) which is mounted in a carrier (10)  and is slidable forwards and backwards along a  guideway (11) in the carrier into and out of a  working position in which it can be locked,  characterised in that the guideway (11) has at its  closed end (13) a protuberance (14) which registers  with a cutaway portion (8) in the forward end (4)  of the backing (2) when the backing is in said  working position.   2. a brake according to claim 1, characterised in  that the protuberance (14) is offset from the  longitudinal axis (xx) of the guideway, and the  backing (2) has its ends (4, 5) shaped so that,  while not having line symmetry about said axis, it  has rotational symmetry of order 2 about it; the  protuberance (14) and the backing ends (4, 5) being  so inter-related that the protuberance (14) prevents  the sliding into working position of a   backing    which  is the mirror image of said backing (2).    3. a brake according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in  that the cutaway portion in the backing (2) is at  a corner (6) of the backing.   4. a brake according to any preceding claim, characterise(  in that the backing (2) is locked in working position  by locking means (15) having a forwardly projecting  member (16) which, in the locking position, projects  beyond the trailing edge (23) of the   backing    (2)  and is situated at least partly between the plane of  the backing (2) and the plane of the lining (1).     5. a brake according to claim 4 characterised in  that the forwardly projecting member (16) registers  with a cutaway portion (9) in the rear end (5) of  the backing.
