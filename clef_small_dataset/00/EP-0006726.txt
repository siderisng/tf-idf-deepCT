<ABSTRACT>
according to one aspect of the invention, all of these  difficulties are met by using on the helmet an exhaust regulating  valve comprising a collapsible and expansible housing including  a hinged flap (29) and a peripheral bellows wall (32) on the flap,  an orificed seat (33) in the housing covering an outlet opening in  the housing, and a flexible membrane (37) adjacent to the seat  and connected to the flap (29) so that hingeing movements of  the flap (29) in response to pressure variations in the helmet  effect progressive laying of the membrane (37) on to and  progressive lifting of the membrane (37) from the orificed seat  (33).  a further safety feature is a shut-off valve (45) whereof the  seating is at an inlet opening in the housing and the closure  member (47) is on the hinged flap (29).  according to another aspect of the invention, lung ventilÂ­ tion is obtained by using demand-type supply and exhaust  valves, and spring-loading them both to the open position.  it is  found that the work of opening one is done by the other and vice  versa, rather than by the user of the equipment.
