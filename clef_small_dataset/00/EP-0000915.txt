<ABSTRACT>
1.  tilting joint for awnings, comprising a holder (20) for the swivel axis (19) of the upper joint arm (18), which is mounted on the bar linkage support (32) of the awning (10) so as to be tiltable about an axis (30) extending transversely to the said swivel axis (19) and which is limited in its degree of tilt by a stop (43), characterised in that, when the holder (20) is tilted, the stop (43) is locked, to counteract the direction of tilt, by a retaining face (37) which extends transversely to the direction of tilt, and that there is provided a disengaging mechanism (47), which can be moved transversely to the direction of tilt, which is actuated by the upper joint arm (18) when the awning is retracted and which moves the stop (43) away from the retaining face (37).
