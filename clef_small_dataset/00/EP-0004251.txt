<ABSTRACT>
method and device for the portionwise advance building in in-situ concrete of load-bearing structures, in particular of bridge support frameworks, where a support (6) consisting of individual elements and having at least two separate parallel strands is built on ready-made, supportable structural parts (4) or pillars (2) and is anchored (7) on a ready-made structural part or pillar, a shuttering support (12) is suspended by means of support members (11) situated to the side of the shuttering space on a framework girder (9) arranged transversely to the support (6) and movable on a track (8), and in each case after the portionwise concreting is advanced by a portion length, and the support (6) and the track (8) are continuously extended forward in the advance-building direction and are continuously at least partially dismounted behind.  a work platform (15) supported by a c-shaped structure (14) built onto the girder (9) facilitates the extending of the support (6), if appropriate using the elements being released behind.  a crane can be mounted on the track (8).  support (6), shuttering support (12), framework girder (9) and the structure (14) supporting the work platform (15) are composed of individual standardised elements, the choice of basic elements and reinforcing elements as required ensuring, portionwise, an optimum dimensioning.  <image>
