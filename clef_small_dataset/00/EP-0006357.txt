<ABSTRACT>
a physiologically active substance, which i call «aif»  (anaemia inducing factor), has been isolated from the  human placenta and from the body fluids and tissues of  patients suffering from gastric cancers and has been im­ plicated in the anaemia often associated with malignant  tumours, particularly gastric cancers.  the purified aif  forms the basis for an antigen-antibody test for the pre­ sence of gastric cancer, using a calibration curve such  as that shown in figure 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
"composition and method for detecting gastric cancer" the invention relates to anew physiologically active substance which i call "aif" (anaemia inducing factor) and to the use of this substance to test for the presence of gastric cancer. many cancers can be treated, provided that they are detected and treatment begun at a sufficiently early stage. in many cases, however, the cancers produce symptoms which are not readily detectable and/or which can easily be confused with symptoms of other diseases. there is, therefore, a need for a relatively easy means of detecting the presence of various types of cancer in the human jy. anaemia has frequently been reported in patients suffering from malignant tumours, particularly patients attacked by gastric cancers ["gastric cancer in surgery" (in japanese), masao muto, 1st edition, page 230, kinbara publishing co. limited, tokye (1963)]. it has also been reported than an anaemia-inducing activity can be detected in gastric juices, gastric cancer tissues, serum and urine taken from patients suffering from gastric cancers; however the entity inducing anaemia has not hitherto been isolated cr described. in "hirosaki igaku", by kiyota oh-uti and taisuke nishikawa, volume 27, pages 379 - 396 (1975), i have previously reported that an entity inducing anaemia is present not only in gastric cancer tissues and gastric juices, serum and urine derived from patients suffering from gastric cancers, but also in extracts of human placenta. however, in my previous work, i have only prepared crude extracts of mixtures containing the active substance and have not succeeded in separating and identifying the substance itself. i have now isolated the substance, aif, which induces anaemia in patients suffering from gastric cancer and have determined that this substance is a single compound. the new physiologically active substance,aif, provided by the present invention is characterized by the following properties: 1. elemental analysis c, 42.60 - 46.60%; h, 6.30 - 6.55%3 n, 6.38 - 751%. 2. standard sedimentation coefficient 1.74s(svenberg) = s20w. 3. standard diffusion coefficient 8.28 x 1g¯7cm2/sec 4. molecular weight 19,230 (calculated from standard sedimentation co efficient and standard diffusion coefficient); 20,137 (calculated from amino acid analysis); 21,000 (calculated from sodium dodecyl sulphate-poly acrylamide electrophoresis) 5. isoelectric point ph = 4.58. 6. ultraviolet absorption spectrum as shown in figure 1, measured in a 1% w/v sodium chloride solution at 0.358 mg/ml; e278 = 15.6 x ?03. 7. amino acid composition as shown in table 1: table 1 emi4.1 <tb> <sep> amino <sep> acid <sep> analysis <sep> number <sep> of <tb> <sep> mole/mole <sep> residues <sep> per <tb> <sep> molecule <sep> as <tb> <sep> an <sep> integer <tb> <sep> lysine <sep> 5.62 <sep> - <sep> 5.81 <sep> 6 <tb> <sep> histidine <sep> 0.90 <sep> - <sep> 1.12 <sep> 1 <tb> <sep> arginine <sep> 1.93 <sep> - <sep> 2.01 <sep> 2 <tb> <sep> aspartic <sep> acid <sep> 13.68 <sep> - <sep> 14.22 <sep> 14 <tb> <sep> threonine <sep> 5.62 <sep> - <sep> 5.87 <sep> i <sep> 6 <tb> serine <sep> 1.79 <sep> - <sep> 2.22 <sep> 2 <tb> <sep> glutamic
