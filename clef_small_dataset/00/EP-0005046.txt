<ABSTRACT>
intrusion-detection units (1) which are linked in an alarm  system to a central control unit (3) by cable (2), each include  a coder circuit (8) responsive to opening of intrusion- and  tamper-alarm contacts (5, 6) to change the magnitudes of  current flow in respective alarm and tamper signalling lines  (14, 15) of the cable (2).  current is supplied to the tamper-signalling  line (15) in the circuit (8) via the collector-emitter  path of a transistor (16) from the positive supply-line (10) of  the cable (2), until the alarm-contacts (5) in its collector circuit  open, whereupon current supply of the same magnitude is  continued to that line (15) via the base-emitter path from the  alarm-signalling line (14).  the increase in current in the latter  line (14) is detected, to indicate the alarm condition, in a  decoder circuit (9) of the control unit (3) by operational  amplifiers (36, 40) that respond to the consequent tendency  for change in potential of the line (14).  the decoder circuit (9)  also includes operational amplifiers (22, 23) to detect change  in current magnitude in the tamper-signalling line (15) for  indicating the tamper condition, such change occurring upon  opening of the tamper-contacts (6) of any coder circuit (8) or  any breaking or shorting together of the lines (10, 11, 14, 15)  of the cable (2).  opening of the tamper-contacts (6) interrupts  a current-supply path that is connected to the tamper-signalling  line (15) in parallel with the collector-emitter path  of the coder-circuit transistor (16), or alternatively interrupts  the emitter circuit of that transistor (16).  a resistor (20) is  connected across the supply-lines (10, 11) to increase current  supply to the tamper-line (5) via a diode (21) if the negative  supply-line (11) is broken.

<DESCRIPTION>
electrical alarm circuits and systems this invention relates to electrical alarm circuits and electrical alarm systems including such circuits, being concerned especially with electrical alarm circuits in which there is electrical-signal change in a first or second of two signalling lines in dependence respectively upon whether a first or second alarm condition exists. electrical alarm systems for use in providing alarm signals in response to intrusion into an area to be protected, also conventionally include provision for responding to attempts to interfere with or otherwise tamper with, the intrusiondetector units of the system. in general the cabling that is provided to connect the detector units to the relevant central station or alarm-control unit incorporates three pairs of lines, a first pair of lines being used for signalling the intrusion-alarm condition, a second pair for signalling the tamper-alarm condition, and the third pair for supplying electrical power to the detector units. these lines, which may extend over considerable distance, are vulnerable to attack and unless expensive precautions are taken for their protection can represent a weakness in the security of the alarm system as a whole. it is an object of the present invention to provide an electrical alarm circuit which may be used to improve security in this respect. according to the present invention there is provided an electrical alarm circuit of the kind in which there is electrical-signal change in a first or second of two signalling lines in dependence respectively upon whether a first or second alarm condition exists, characterised in that the first signalling line is connected to a device which is operative in one or the other of two currentconducting modes in series with the second signalling line in dependence upon whether the first alarm condition exists, that substantially the same magnitude of current flow is established in a second signalling line via said device in the two operational modes, that the magnitude of current flow in the first signalling line via said device is dependent upon which of the two operational modes is applicable, and that occurrence of the second alarm condition is effective to change the overall magnitude of current flow in the second signalling line whereby the magnitudes of current flow in the first and second signalling lines are indicative of the existence or otherwise of the first and second alarm conditions respectively. by using the electrical alarm circuit of the present invention it ig possible to achieve a high degree of system security especially in regard to attacks on the first and second signalling lines and other lines included in the cabling. the circuit may simply include a transistor having base and emitter electrodes connected to the first and second signalling lines respectively, and arranged such that the collector circuit of the transistor is interrupted for example by the opening of a set of switch contacts in response to the occurrence of the first alarm condition so as to switch main current flow within the transistor from the collector-emitter path to the
