<ABSTRACT>
1.  a clamp for holding together superposed flat workpieces, in particular sheet metal components, with two clamping brackets (1, 2) connected together forming a u-shaped clip, between the free ends (4) of which the workpieces may be clamped, in which the clamping brackets (1, 2), being spread apart by a spring force, are held in a frame (5) determining the separation of the two ends of the clamping brackets, an in which the frame (5) includes an adjusting element which is designed as a rocker arm (6) tiltable into two positions and by means of which the clamping bracket (1), which is movable with respect to the frame (5), can be moved with respect to the clamping bracket (2) fixed to the frame (5) from the open position into the clamping position against the spring force, characterized in that said rocker arm (6) has two straight edges (7, 8) rounded-off at their place of intersection, the movable clamping bracket (1) abutting in parallel position against each one of said straight edges (7, 8) according to the position of said rocker arm (6), the difference between the distance of said straight edges to the swivel arm (10) of said rocker arm (6) being greater than the separation of the clamping surfaces formed at said free ends (4) when said clamp is in its open position.
