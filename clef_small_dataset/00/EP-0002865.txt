<ABSTRACT>
1.  system for converting at will a hall having a fixed floor into a sport or gymnastic hall or into a theatre or entertainment hall, comprising a movable floor which, in the use position, extends slantwise or by steps in the upward direction and which comprises a front floor part (9) and a back floor part (8), the front edge of which is linked to the back end (14) of the front floor part (9), the back floor part (8) being mounted so as to be able to pivot together with the front floor part (9) until the flow floor parts reach a non-use substantially vertical position, characterized in that the back floor part (8) is carried by horizontal pivots or by a horizontal shaft (11) extending at some distance from its ends (16) and operating means are provided for causing the back floor part (8) to pivot clockwise or counterclockwise, the operating means and the link between the front (9) and back (8) floor parts being such that said link raises and the front floor part (9) pivots simultaneously toward the back floor part (8) around said link, whereas the front end (15) of the front floor part (9) remains at least in the vicinity of the fixed floor (2) of the hall and the back floor part (8) is caused to pivot, under the influence of the operating means, toward the substantially vertical position around the horizontal pivots or the horizontal shaft (11) until it reaches a non use position, wherein the lower face of the front floor part (9) is adjacent to the lower face of the back floor part (8), said link going down and the front floor part (9) pivoting so as to move away from the back floor part (8) when the operating means cause the back floor part (8) to pivot from the substantially vertical position to a substantially horizontal use position, in which both floor parts (8, 9) extend in prolongation of each other.
