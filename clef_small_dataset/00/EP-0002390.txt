<ABSTRACT>
this invention concerns a method and apparatus for  cryptographic data file security in multiple domain data  processing systems.  an embodiment of the invention provides a file security  system for data files created at a first host system (j) in one  domain and recovered at a second host system (k or l) in  another domain of a multiple domain network.   each of the host systems contain a data security device (11)  provided with multiple host master keys and  capable of performing a variety of cryptographic operations.   creation and recovery of a secure data file is accomplished  without revealing the master keys of either of the host  systems to the other of the host systems.  when the data file  is to be created at the first host system, the first host system  data security device provides a file recovery key for subsequent  recovery of the data file at the second host system and  enciphers first host system plaintext under a primary file key,  which is related to the file recovery key, to obtain first host  system ciphertext as the data file.  the file recovery key is  used as header information for the data file or maintained  separately as a private file recovery key.  when the data file is  to be recovered at the second host system, the file recovery  key is provided at the second host system and the second  host system data security device performs a cryptographic  operation to transform the file recovery key into a form  which is usable to decipher the data file.  the second host  system data security device then uses the transformed file  recovery key to perform a cryptographic operation to obtain  the first host system ciphertext in clear form at the second  host system.
