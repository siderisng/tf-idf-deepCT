<ABSTRACT>
in an analogue to digital converter, the analogue signal  applied thereto is sampled at successive time intervals and at  each sample a digital signal is produced and the time interval  between successive samples is not necessarily constant but  is dependent upon the rate of change of amplitude of the  analogue signal during said time interval.  the digital signals  may be applied to a counter to produce data representative  of the time interval between successive samples and also to  indicate whether the analogue signal has increased or  decreased between successive samples.  this data may then  be recorded in a manner to provide substantially constant  recording density.
