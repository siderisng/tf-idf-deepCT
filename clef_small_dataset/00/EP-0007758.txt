<ABSTRACT>
ionomers comprising higher alkyl ammonium or quaterÂ­ nary polyammonium salts of polyacids, particularly sulfonic  acids, having anionic groups covalently bonded to carbon  atoms comprising a backbone chain of a polymer, or to  acyclic, alicyclic or aromatic radicals which are pendant to the  backbone chain of the polymer, are novel compositions of  matter.  these ionomers vary in properties from water-soluble  polyelectrolytes useful as thickening agents to thermoplastic  elastomers which can be extruded, injection molded, vacuum  formed, etc.  at elevated temperatures.  the elastomers are  useful as speciality and general purpose rubbers.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to the preparation and use of novel ionic polymers comprising alkyl ammonium, ammonium and polyammonium salts of polymers having one or more anionic groups covalently bonded to a carbon atom comprising the polymer. preferred anionic groups are sulfonate, carboxylate and phosphonate groups. the most preferred anionic group is a sulfonate group. this invention relates to ionic polymers. more par ticularly, this invention relates to ammonium salts of anionic polymers, i.e. polymers containing covalently bound nega- tively charged groups. most particul2rly, this invention is concerned with novel compositions of matter comprising certain higher alkyl ammonium salts or quaternary polyammonium salts of polymers having incorporated therein one or more covalently bonded anionic radicals selected from sulfonate, carboxylate and phosphonate radicals. the particular ammonium salts of this inventicn may be schematically represented as: 1. [c-a]p+1 r3n+ +q - r2n+ +pr herein c is one of a plurality of carbon atoms comprising a portion of the polymer backbone chain of carbon atoms or is in an acyclic alicyclic or aromatic radical which is pendant to the backbone chain and wherein the c is in a single polymer molecule; a is an anionic radical, preferably a sulfonate group, covalently bonded to one or more of the c carbon atoms; and wherein the r groups represent substituents of the nitrogen atom(s) which are each independently selected from hydrogen, c1 to c50 straight or branched chain acyclic, alicyclic, aryl, alkaryl and aralkyl radicals and substituted functional derivatives thereof, provided at least one of the r groups is a c12 to c50 straight or branched chain acyclic, alicyclic, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl radical or a substituted functional derivative thereof, and wherein each q is independently selected from c1 to c40 divalent straight or branched chain alkylene, cycloalkylene, arylene, dialkylene-arylene radicals, a substituted functional derivative theroef or-(chy)n-zm-(chy)n wherein z is the hetero atom, oxygen or sulfur, m is zero or one, y is hydrogen, said c1 to c50 radical-or a substituted functional derivative of the radical and n is an integer of from 1 to 10, wherein p is from zero (for a monoammonium counterion) to about 10, more preferably zero to about 4, and most preferably zero or one, and wherein the ammonium counterion at least partially neutralizes saict anionic acid radicals0 other sulfonated salts of the present invention are represented by the formula: : 2o [c - s03 pal r13n+*q - r'2n]-pr' wherein c is one of a plurality of carbon atoms comprising a portion of the polymeric backbone chain of carbon atoms or is in an acyclic, alicyclic or aromatic radical which is pendant to the backbone chain and wherein the c is in a single polymer chain, the -so3 groups are covalently bonded to one or more of the c carbon atoms in one or more of the polymeric backbone chains wherein each q is independently selected from c1 to c40 divalent straight or branched chain alkylene, cycloalkylene, arylene, dialkylene-arylene radical a substituted functional derivative thereof or -(chy) z -(chy)n, wherein z is
