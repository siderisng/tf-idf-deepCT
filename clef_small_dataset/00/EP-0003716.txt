<ABSTRACT>
polymerization of olefins, in particular ethylene, by means of a catalytic system comprising an organic compound of aluminium and a suspension or solution of a magnesium salt in a non-polar organic solvent, the salt having been previously heated and dehydrated in the presence of acetic acid or of acetic anhydride and then brought into contact with the olefin.  this catalytic system, absolutely free from transition metals keeps its polymerizing activity without interruption for a long time.
