<ABSTRACT>
thio-bis-(hydrocarbon-bisoxazolines) and analogs,  which are the reaction products of thio-bis-(hydrocarbon-­ substituted dicarboxylic acid material), for example, thio-bis­ (polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride), with about 1 to 4 moles  of 2,2-disubstituted-2-amino-1-alkanols, such as tris -(hyd­ roxymethyl) amino-methane (tham), and their derivatives  are useful additives in oleaginous compositions, such as  sludge dispersants for lubricating oil or anti-corrosion agents  for fuels.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention concerns oil-soluble thio-bis (hydrocarbon-bisoxazolines) and their analogs, their method of preparation and the utility of said oxazolines in hydrocarbon fuel and lubricating systems as highly stable anticorrosion agents and/or sludge dispersants. during the past decade, ashless sludge dispersants have become increasingly important, primarily in improving the performance of lubricants and gasoline in keeping the engine clean of deposits, and permitting extended crankcase oil drain periods. most commercial ashless dispersants fall into several general categories. in one category, a polyamine is linked to a long-chain hydrocarbon polymer, such as polyisobutylene, through a dicarboxylic acid material, such as succinic anhydride, by forming amide or imide linkages, such as described in u.s. patent 3,172,892. united kingdom specification 809,001 teaches corrosion inhibitors comprising a multiple salt complex derived from the reaction product of hydrocarbyl-substituted dicarboxylic acids and hydroxy amines (including 2-amino-2methyl-1,3-propanediol [ampd]) and tris-hydroxymethylamino- methane (tham) further complexed with mono-and polycarboxylic acids (see examples 17-19). united kingdom specification 984,409 teaches ashless, amide/imide/ester type lubricant additives prepared by reacting an alkenyl succinic anhydride, said alkenyl group having 30 to 700 carbon atoms, with a hydroxy amine including tham. german os 2512201 teaches reacting long-chain hydrocarbon-substituted succinic anhydride with 2, 2-disubstituted-2-amino-l-aikanol to produce mono- and bisoxazoline products. thio-bis-(alkyl lactone oxazolines), useful as oleaginous additives, and chlorinecontaining thio-bis-adducts of sulfur chlorides with octenyl succinic anhydride are disclosed in u.s.p. 4,062,786. it has now been discovered that the dehydrochlorinated thio-bis-adducts or acylating agents obtained by the reaction of sulfur halides with hydrocarbyl-substituted dicarboxylic anhydrides or acids or esters can be further reacted with 2,2-disubstituted-2-amino l-alkanols to form oxazolines. the reaction of the thio-bis-adducts or acylating agents is carried out using 1 to 4, preferably 2 to 4 molar equivalents of the alkanol per molar equivalent of said adduct. the most preferred proportions comprise 4 moles of the alkanol per mole of said acylating agent thereby forming a thio-bis-(hydrocarbon-bis-oxazoline) having about 4 oxazoline groups per molecule. these oxazolines are highly stable additives with outstanding varnish inhibition. a preferred member of this novel class of additives can be represented by the formula: emi2.1 wherein r is selecte from the group consisting of hydro- gen and alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 400 carbons, x is selected from the group consisting of an oil or hy droxyalkyl group and at least one of the x substtuents and preferably both of the x substituents being 2 hydroxy alkyl group of the structure -(cii,2)10h where n is 1 to 3, and y is selected from dhe croup consisting of -s-, -s-s-, s=0 (sulfinyl), 5 s02 (sulfonyl), -se- (seleno) and -s- (ch2)z -s- wherein z is a number from 2 to 1c preferred herein is thio-bis-(polyisobutenyl-bisoxazoline) of number average molecular weight ranging from about 400 to 100,000 prepared by the reaction of thio-bis (acylating reagent), e.g. thio-bis-(polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride), with tetramolar proportions of tris-chydroxy- methyl) amino-methane (hereinafter designated also as tham). the reaction is carried out at a temperature from about 100 to 240 c., preferably 150-180 c, until about six
