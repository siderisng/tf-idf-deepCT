<ABSTRACT>
a time switch (100) comprises terminals (110) spaced  around a slip ring (108) connected to a voltage source (v).  a  motor (104) drives a brush (102) to sequentially connect the  terminals (110) to the slip ring (108) to energise the terminals  in sequence.  each terminal (110) - as shown for one of them  designated 112 - is connected via a respective transistor (116)  and manually operable switch (124) to a pair of common output  conductors or bus-bars (130, 132), whereby for each succesÂ­ sive period of time corresponding to each successive terminal  (110) being energised the conductors (130, 132) are energised  in accordance with the setting of a respective one of the  switches.  thus, a desired time-varying pattern of energisation  of the conductors (130, 132) to accomplish a control function,  e. g.  the control of a central heating system to provide different  heat outputs at different times of the day, can be set up at will  simply by adjusting the various switches (124).
