<DESCRIPTION>
silicon alloyed steel. the present invention relates to an si-alloyed high carbon steel, which by isothermal heat treatment obtains particularly advantageous strength and toughness properties and which is useful especially in wearing parts subjected to heavy impacts. for such wearing parts it is generally known to use mn-alloyed austenitic steel, so-called hadfield steel, when, in addition to abrasion resistance, toughness is required of the part. if toughness is not necessary it is possible to use e.g. high carbon chromium alloyed steels (1.0 % c, 12 % cr). both such steels have several drawbacks. hadfield steel (1.0 % c, 13 % mn) is difficult to manufacture, it can only be formed by casting and its corrosion resistance and weldability are poor. due to the high mn-alloy content this steel is also expensive. high carbon chromium steels, on the other hand, are brittle and their workability is poor. they are also expensive due to high alloy content. the advantageous mechanical properties of the steel according to the present invention are based on the bainitic-austenitic dual-phase microstructure obtained in the isothermal heat treatment. the bainitic component of the microstructure gives the steel good initial hardness and rich residual austenite gives it strong strain hardening capacity. the chemical composition figures stated in the following are based on the weight. in the present steel, advantage has been taken of a known effect of silicon to prevent carbide formation. by increasing the silicon content of a high carbon steel up to 2.0 - 3.0 %, carbide formation can be prevented during isothermal decomposition of austenite at a suitable temperature. the use of silicon as an alloying element is known e.g. in spring steels wherein c- and si-contents are generally c < 0.8 %, si < 2.0 %. in these steels, si-alloying is generally used as an alloying element increasing hardenability and tempering resistance. commonly known are also low carbon high si-alloyed steels (c < 0.1 %, sic 2.0 - 4.0 %) which are used as core plates of electromagnets. the purpose of si-alloying is to prevent the formation of carbide (cementite), when after the austenitizing the steel is allowed to decompose isothermally to upper bainite within a temperature range of 350 - 4500c or to lower bainite within the temperature range of 280 3500c. thus, the obtained bainitic ferrite only contains -0.01 % of carbon. with carbide formation prevented, carbon must diffuse into the remaining austenite as the bainite reaction proceeds. this, on the other hand, increases the stability of austenite with increasing carbon content. if for example the carbon content of a steel is 1.0 % and it decomposes to 50 % bainite without carbide formation, the carbon content of residual austenite increases to appr. 2 %. thus, by controlling the composition (c- and si-content) of the steel, decomposition temperature and holding time, it is possible to control the bainite-austenite ratio obtained as a result of the decomposition of austenite. the following examples illustrate mechanical properties obtained with the steel according to the invention. the
