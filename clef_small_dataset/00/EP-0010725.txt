<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for the elek tropic developing radiographic recording carrier is proposed, wherein the recording medium (5) on the cylindrical surface (1a) of a rotatably gela mounted drum (1) or a rotatably mounted. Trom melsegment is fixed and in a development volume constant cross-section, which is formed between the Zylindri surface surface and a rotatably mounted ring electrode (8), developer liquid (12) is filled. Subsequently, the Zylin Drive surface and / or the ring electrode is pivoted in such a way that the recording medium is introduced into the developing liquid in a particular direction (A). Thereafter, the cylindrical surface and / or the ring electrode is in turn pivoted so that the drawing carrier in the same direction (a) leaves the developing larder. As a result, a laminar attraction of the toner suspended in the developer fluid is achieved to the electrostatic charge image of the recording carrier.
