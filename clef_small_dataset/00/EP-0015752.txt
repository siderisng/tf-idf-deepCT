<ABSTRACT>
in the process of the invention, first and second mono­ merrubber solutions are fed to a first back-mixed polymeri­ zation zone such that the first solution forms particles of  about 0. 5 to 1. 5 microns and the second solution, having  present a dissolved tubber and a dissolved polymer of said  monomer, forms particles of about 2 to 10 microns during  partial polymerization of 10 to 50% of the monomers.  the  partially polymerized solutions are further polymerized in a  second zone, with linear flow, to a conversion of 20 to 95%,  forming a polyblend with a bimodal rubber particle size  distribution having improved toughness and gloss.
