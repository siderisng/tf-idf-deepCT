<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement contains a fork circuit for the two-wire four-wire transition into PCM time multiplexing systems, which is connected on the two-wire side with a feeding bridge, wherein in the reception branch of the four-wire line a low-pass filter with negligence sigbar output impedance and in the transmission branch of the four wire line a low-pass filter with high input impedance lies. The arrangement has the features that certain characteristic values ​​of the two-wire side is given a particular behavior that the receiving branch of the four-wire line device with an ohmic resistor (RA) is completed, the resistance value with certain characteristics of the two-wire and the four-wire side also in one Specific relationship is that the output signal of the low pass (EF) lying in the receiving branch (EF) via a four-pin circuit (VP), which is constructed from resistors and optionally a capacitor, is superimposed on the input signal from the two-wire line device for the low pass (SF) in the transmission branch , wherein the dimensioning of the four-pole is so taken so that the two four-wire branches are coupled, and that the low passes (EF, SF) are dimensioned so that they compensate for the term distortions caused by the fork circuit.
