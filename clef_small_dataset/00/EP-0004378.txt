<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an apparatus for the entrenching  of pipes in underwater beds, of the type in which a  framework, provided with excavating means, is positioned  across the pipe (11) to be entrenched and dragged along  the pipe so as to excavate two parallel trenches adjacent  to both sides to the pipe, the pipe being entrenched due  to the collapsing (either spontaneous or caused by disgregating  means) of the bed zone thus remaining under  the pipe already laid onto the bed.  the excavated material  is removed by means of a pump and discharged again, at  a predetermined distance from and rearwardly of the framework,  on the entrenched pipe.  the framework is provided  with side supporting skid members, by which furthermore  the entrenching height is adjustable.
