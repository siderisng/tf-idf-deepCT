<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel PHOSP HOR (phosphon) acid esters of the formula in the R¹ unbranched or branched alkyl radicals having up to 4 carbon atoms, R² unbranched or branched alkyl radicals, alkoxy radicals or alkylthio radicals having up to 4 carbon father, mono- or dialkylaminores with up to to 4 carbon atoms in an alkyl group or phenyl, R 3 unbranched or branched alkoxy or alkyl thiorates with up to 4 carbon atoms, the aminog rum, mono- or dialkylaminores with up to 4 carbon atoms in an alkyl group, alkyl alkoxyalkylaminores with up to 4 carbon atoms in a Alkyl or alkoxyalkyl group, dialkoxy kylaminores with up to 4 carbon atoms in an alkoxyalkyl group, alkyl-alkenylaminores with up to 4 carbon atoms in an alkyl or alkenyl group, alkyl alkynylomoro residues of up to 4 carbate Toff atoms in an alkyl or alkynyl group, the n -Methyl-N-methoxy aminorest, the N- (2-methoxyethyl) -N- (2-cyanoethyl) -Rest, a stick material-containing heterocyclic ring with 5 or 6 ring members, which may contain a plurality of nitrogen atoms and given if oxygen as ring members, R⁴ optionally by halogen substituted acyl radicals with up to 4 Carbon atoms, alkylsulfonyl or haloalkylsulfonyl radicals with up to 4 carbon atospheres in the alkyl or haloalkyl group, the group -CO-NR⁵r⁶, wherein R⁵ and R⁶ is hydrogen, no longer or branched alkyl with up to 4 carbon father or phenyl, with the Specification that R⁵ and R⁶ together with the nitrogen atom whose substituents are a 5 or 6-membered heterocyclic ring with further nitrogen atoms and an oxygen atom as ring members may nen, or the group -CO-Y-R⁷, wherein R⁷ for Non-worn or branched alkyl with up to 4 carbon fatomas, phenyl or benzyl and Y are oxygen or sulfur, and x oxygen O The sulfur, which are effective against pests, in particular against insects, mites and ticks, effective, pesticides containing these phosphorus (phosphon) acid esters as active ingredients, a method for producing these active ingredients and a method for controlling pests of these active ingredients.
