<ABSTRACT>
In a method for continuous extruded sen electrical-conductive, granulated, preferably pulmetallurgical materials, the material (7) with TELS running strokes of a stamp (8; 8b) in the passage channel (2) of a die against the frictional resistance of the existing in the die, Already compressed strand section compressed, pushed further under the pressure of the compression stroke in the continuous channel (2), sintered by electrical currents and extracted over a mouthpiece (4) mounted at the end of the passage channel (2). In order to achieve a heating of the material fabric (7) in the die for sintering such that it takes place via the strand cross section as evenly as possible and also in dependence on the degree of compaction of the material (7), the heating for sintering is longitudinally between the entire between punch (8; 8b) and mouthpiece (4) in the die-located material (7) carried out by generating a current directed in this flowing in the longitudinal line. In a suitable device for this purpose, the punch (8; 8b) and the mouthpiece (4) are connected to the die output with the poles of a voltage source, wherein the wall (3) of the continuous channel (2) consists of an electrically non-conductive material.
