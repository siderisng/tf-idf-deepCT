<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a device that comprises a first  frame 5 with which is integral a stanchion 1 that supports  ventilation elements 2 and rests, via clutch means 7, on a  second frame 9 integral with a carriage 10 movable alternate­ ly, in the directions 11 and 12, in the corridor existing  between two facing frames 3 and 4 on which the bricks being  dried are arranged.  the frame 5 is movable with respect to a vertical spindle  13 whose lower part is provided with an arm 15 that has a  projection 16 positioned at a level lower than the lower  extremity of the spindle 13.  the interception of the projection 16 against guide  means 20 and 21 provided in the said corridor allows the  axes of the fans 2 to orientate suitably and to rotate 180° in  the region of the extremities of the corridor, and makes it  possible to direct the flow of air produced by the fans 2  against the bricks placed at the extremities of the frames 3  and 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
ventilation device for drving bricke the invention has as its subject a ventilation device for drying bricks utilizable, in particular, in drying chambers where the bricks are stacked in superposed rows on a number of parallel frames. ventilation devices are ourrently used in the aforementioned drying chambers which are made to slide, in the two directions, in the corridor existing between two facing frames on which there are superposed rows of bricks and these, by contributing to an increase in the relative velocity between the hot air and the article to be dried, guarantee a faster drying of the said bricks. one problem derived from the use of the said devices consists in obtaining the most uniform possible drying of the bricks arranged on opposite sides with respect to the device itself, in this connection various systems have been employed to date, amongst which, for example, a large fan, of a diameter at least equal to the height of the pair of facing frames that accept the bricks, supported by a carriage movable parallel in the two directions, in which the rotation direction of the impeller is reversed either when changing from one direction of movement to the opposite one, or in accordance with predetermined intervals of time, so as to ensure the same ventilation conditions (since there is a difference existing between the delivery and the aspiration of the air) for the articles to be dried. this method is not devoid of problems due, above all, to down times occasioned by the acceleration and deceleration time needed for inversions in the rotation rirection. another method comprises a number of fans, of a small diameter, placed vertically one on the other and fixed to a vertical stanchion which is turned by a rack, when hitting against corresponding fixed linit devices paced at the enrt- reltles of the path followed b the carriage that carries the said fans, through 180 thereby directing the flow of air from the fans (which in this method rotate constantly in one and the sane direction) alternately towards the fac- ing rows of bricks arranged on the said franes. this method requires, however, the rack coupling member to be oversized in order to prevent in from breaking where the limit knock takes place and, therefore, at the very tine rotation starts, because o the considerable inertia of the masses that are moving. the object of the present invention is, therefore, to overcome the aforementioned difficulties through the construction of a ventilation device, in particular for drying bricks, which allows the rotation and orientation of the ventilation element or elements at the nost suitable angle and, contem- poraneously, the said position to be stably kept, not only in the region of the extremities but also along the path followed by the said device, and this by neans of mechanical methods that are extremely inple and are also financially advantageous , above all in relation to the results obtained therewith. this and other objects too are attained with
