<ABSTRACT>
a spinning assembly for use in a process for the production  of sheath/core bicomponent fibres comprising a spinneret  plate (1) having at least one counter-bore (2) terminating  in an extrusion orifice (3), a distributor plate (4) spaced apart  from but facing the spinneret plate (1) to provide a liquid  channel (5) therebetween for communication with a source of  sheath-forming material, the distributor plate (4) being provided  with an aperture (7) opposite each orifice (3) in the  spinneret plate (1) for communication with a source of coreforming  material and a plateau-like protrusion (9) on the distributor  plate (4) extending about the axis common to the  aperture (7) and the extrusion orifice (3) characterised in that  there is provided an orifice plate (11) for restricting the entrance  to the counter-bore (2).
