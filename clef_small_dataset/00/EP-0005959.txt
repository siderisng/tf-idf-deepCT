<ABSTRACT>
fins for heat exchangers are arranged with louvres  (46,47,56,57) or other inclined surfaces (44,45,54,55) which  lie along planes which are inclined to the general direction of  flow (a) of heat exchange medium over the fins.  in one form the fins have mutually inclined v-shaped  portions (44,45,54,55) with louvres (46,47,56,57) formed in  the flanks (44,45,54,55) of the v.  in this case the louvres  (46,47,56,57) are in sets spaced from one another.  the  louvres (46,47,56,57) are inclined to the planes of the flanks  (44,45,54,55) and in opposite directions on each flank  (44,45,54,55).  in another form the fins are made up of side by side  strips (11,12,13) of corrugated material.  the flanks (15) of the  corrugations are inclined to the general direction of flow (a)  of medium over the fin and the strips (11,12,13) are displaced  from one another in their longitudinal direction.  in each case the arrangement provides for a large gap  between the strips (11,12,13) or the louvres (46,47,56,57)  without a reduction in the number of strips (11,12,13) or  louvres (46,47,56,57).  the fins may be used in conjunction  with tubes (31,50) through which another heat exchange  medium is passed.  an apparatus is also provided for making the corrugated  fins.
