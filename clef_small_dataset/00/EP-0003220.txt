<ABSTRACT>
in accordance with the present invention, there is  provided herein a method of increasing the strength of wet  glass fiber mats prepared by the wet-laid process.  the  wet-strength of such freshly prepared glass fiber mats are  improved in this invention by treating the wet mat with a  dilute solution of an anionic surfactant.  as a feature of the  invention, the wet-strength of such mats are increased  substantially so that they may be conveniently handled and  transferred, even manually, for further processing, e. g.  for  applying binders and drying, into the finished glass fiber mat  product.
