<ABSTRACT>
a conveyor chain comprises a plurality of links (19)  joined together with a plurality of pins (20), and a plurality of  spacers (21).  each pin (20) penetrates end portions of two  pairs of links (19) for chaining the links into first and second  spaced apart side length portions and the links and pins  cooperate for transmitting tensile stress imposed on the  chain.  each of the plurality of spacers (21) is penetrated by at  least one pin (20) and has a carrier portion projecting from  the chain for engaging an object to be moved with the chain.   the carrier portion may comprise clips (24) for receiving and  gripping rod-like axles (25) of conveyor rollers (28) or gripÂ­ pers for partially encircling a pair of objects to be moved with  the chain.
