<ABSTRACT>
electronic processing means (17) in combination  with dedicated sensing apparatus (16) is used to control  the operation of an hvac system which regulates the  temperature in one or more temperature controlled  spaces (98,99,100) through modulation of the discharge  temperature from one, or all, of a combination of air  conditioning sources including, a source of mixed air  comprised of some proportionate mixture of outside air  and return air from the controlled spaces (98,99,100), a  source of hot air, and a source of cold air.  the sensing  apparatus (16) provides output signals representative of  each of a plurality of selected sensed parameters within  the hvac system including source discharge temperatures,  space temperatures, and outside air temperatures,  in addition to relative humidity of outside air and return  air from the spaces.  the electronic processing means (17)  successively samples and registers successively sampled  values of the sensed parameters from the sensing  apparatus; and provides in response thereto, calculated  reference temperatures in dependence on the summation  of the product terms of a space temperature error multiplied  by a proportional gain constant and an integral gain  constant, the electronic processing means (17) controlling  the modulation of the sources of mixed air, hot air,  and cold air in dependence on the temperature difference  between the calculated reference temperature value and  the corresponding sensed source discharge temperature.   the electronic processing means (17) and associated  sensing apparatus (16) being readily adapted for interface  with existing hvac systems, the electronic processing  means (17) control functions being implemented through  interface apparatus (20) installed in each of the existing  hvac control lines associated with the sources of mixed  air, hot air, and cold air and selectably operable in either of  two positions to provide control of the hvac system by  the electronic processing means (17) when operated in a  first position, and to allow control of the hvac through  existing control lines when operated in a second position.
