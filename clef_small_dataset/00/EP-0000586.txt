<ABSTRACT>
ion sources which become coated with insulative materials  are rejuvenated by forming the repeller electrode (46) in  the ion source of gold (50) and bombarding such repeller  electrode with ions to sputter the gold onto the coated surfaces  (49) to render them conductive again.  gold sputtering  is accomplished by bombarding the gold repeller electrode  (46) with inert argon ions.  to perform this method, the slit of the extractor plate  (52,53) in the ion source is greatly reduced in cross-sectional  area (51) such that the normally higher sputtering pressures  may be maintained within the ion source itself.  if a direct  sample probe is used, it too may be formed of gold and used  to provide the gold sputtering source.
