<ABSTRACT>
a mobility aid comprises a four-legged walking frame  characterized by the front legs of the frame having ground-­ engaging wheels (9) with axes (8) movable in unison in the  direction of the lengths of the legs, by one-way wheel-driving  means responsive to upwards movement of said wheel axes  (8) to cause forward rotational motion of the wheels (9), and  by resilient means (14) acting to urge said wheel axes (8)  downwardly of the front legs.  in the freestanding condition of the frame, the resilient  means (14) lift the front of the frame so that when the frame is  pressed down the user bearing down on the frame, the wheels  (9) are caused to rotate in the sense to cause forward move­ ment of the aid, the rear legs dragging as a result.  a repeated  bearing down action, easily accomplished even by the  severely handicapped, thus results in easily controllable for­ ward motion of the aid.
