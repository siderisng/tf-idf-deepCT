<ABSTRACT>
audible warning for a driver of a road vehicle of the  presence of another vehicle in the vicinity is provided by a  microphone (d) on the outside of his vehicle (a) and an  audio amplifier and loudspeaker (e) inside it.  the amplifier  can be set to transmit only signals above a given level (i. e.   originating only from close vehicles or those which are  hooting).

<DESCRIPTION>
audible warning equipment in and for a road vehicle this invention relates to audible warning equipment in a road vehicle. the sound insulation of road vehicles is increasingly efficient, and especially when heaters or an air-conditioning system is being used inside the vehicle, all the windows have to be closed for best performance. however, when windows are closed, substantially all the external noise is cut off. -the absence of aural awareness of nearby vehicles, especially if they are hooting, can possibly cause accidents. this invention, in effect, extends the driver's ears to outside his vehicle. a microphone is to be mounted to receive sound outside the vehicle and then to present it, suitably amplified, to the driver it is connected to an audio amplifier and a speaker. the microphone can be placed at appropriate positions on the outside of the vehicle, especially its rear offside, so as to supply an input signal to the audio amplifier from time to time. thus all, or only a selected part, of the external noise environment can be transmitted to the speaker in the vehicle for the driver's information and safety. a particular embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein figure 1 is a perspective view showing the installation of the embodiment on a vehicle and figure 2 is a circuit diagram. figure 1 shows the external appearance of a motor car a with the embodiment installed. the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle b contains an audio amplifier f and speaker e. a microphone d is mounted at the rear offside of the vehicle, outside the cab: and further microphones may be provided at suitable places. figure 2 shows an audio amplifier circuit wherein a1 and a are operational amplifiers which are integral 1 2 circuits respectively. the former can be type ca 324 and the latter ca810q or ca8loqm. the values of the capacitors and resistors around a2 show optima obtained by experiment. a sound wave converted to an electrical signal by the microphone d. is fed from terminal vi. this signal is adequately amplified by the first amplifier a1 and then by power amplifier a2. the detailed principle of operation a1 and a2, is well known. vr is an analog variable resistor (onto which a sectionalized switch may be connected to alter it into a sectionalized digital variable resistor) for adjusting the signal output from a which is applied to a2. therefore the output from the speaker e (here designated sp) after amplification by a2 can be adjusted optionally. this allows for ordinary noise (other than vehicle horns,noise from an emergency brake etc.) to be suppressed from emission by the speaker while sharper or louder noises (e.g. horns and noise of emergency brakes) are projected from the said speaker. of course, the ordinary facility of simple volume control can be made available too. in conclusion, the effectiveness and characteristics of the invention are summarized as follows: (1) it is an electronic circuit
