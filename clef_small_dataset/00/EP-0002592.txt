<ABSTRACT>
a bladeless pump (a) that includes a housing (b) that  defines a circular confined space (c) of substantial width into  which either a single phase fluid or multiphase fluid is  sequentially introduced through a centrally disposed inlet  (22, 18, 20, 16) in a first side (10) of the housing (b) to be  subjected to boundary layer rotational drag by at least one  substantially smooth disc (46) that rotates in the confined  space (c) intermediate the first and second side pieces (10,  12) of the housing (b) and parallel thereto.  the pump is  capable of pumping a multiphase fluid such as that from a  geothermal well that includes water, dissolved solids, steam  and gas vapor, or a fluid in which the outer phase is water  and the inner phase may range through such diverse  materials as particled coal, marine animals such as fish,  shrimp and crustaceans, and edibles that include fruits,  vegetables, and berries, as well as metallic objects of which  steel ball bearings is an example.  the pump has the  capability of pumping beer without appreciable frothing the  latter.  also, the pump is particularly adapted for pumping a  multiphase liquid in which the inner phase is extremely  frangible, of which blood is an important example.  the  boundary layers on the rotating discs (46) prevent objects in  the inner phase of a fluid contacting the discs and as a result  there is little or no abrasion of the latter.  also, the boundary  layers on the discs protect the latter from contact with  bubbles in the fluid, and as a result there is no cavitation on  the discs due to abrupt collapse of the bubbles.
