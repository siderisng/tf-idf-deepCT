<ABSTRACT>
a process for detecting parasites which are found in the  blood of a host.  a sample of blood is drawn into a capillary  tube (2) which contains a generally cylindrical mass (6) having  a specific gravity such that it will float in one of the cell layers  when the sample is separated by centrifugation.  the specific  gravity of the mass (6) is selected so as to cause the cylindri­ cal mass or body (6) to combine with the bore wall (4) of the  capillary tube (2) to form a thin annular space (12) in the capil­ lary tube (2) into which the parasites will be crowded, thus in­ creasing the concentration of parasites in a restricted area of  the centrifuged blood sample and rendering the parasites  highly visible.  a stain may be used to differentially color the  parasites.  one specific parasite which can be detected in this  manner quickly and inexpensively is heartworm.
