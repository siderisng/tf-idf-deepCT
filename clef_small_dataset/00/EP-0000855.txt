<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method for the preliminary adjustment of a tandem stand continuous mill for the hot rolling of metal products, in particular thick products, by means of a model giving the ratios between the values of certain parameters such as input and output speeds, the dimensions and the temperature variations of the product, the rolling forces and torques, the slip, the input and output tractions, the reference value being the speed, and in which method the rotational speed of the rolls is acted upon characterised in that : - the thickness reductions per stand having been selected, the rotational speed ratio of the upstream and downstream stands and the output speed of the product from the upstream stand are calculated by means of the model ; - the output speed of the product from the upstream stand is measured, the product being engaged in this stand alone ; - the measured speed is compared with the calculated speed ; - the coefficients relating to the various parameters of the ratios provided by the model are corrected, if necessary, by re-calculating them from the measured value of the speed of the product ; - the new rotational speed ratio of the rolls of the two stands is calculated from the corrected coefficients of the model ; - the rotational speed of at least one of the stands is modified in according with the new ratio before the entry of the product into the downstream stand.
