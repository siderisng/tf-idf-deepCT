<ABSTRACT>
New quinoxaline DI-N-oxide derivatives of the general formula in which R₁ is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R₂ and R₃ independently straight-chain or branched alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms or together with the N-atom optionally by alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms substituted heterocy cliche ring with 4 to 5 ring carbon atoms and optionally an oxygen atom as further hetero roatom, R₄ hydrogen, methoxy, methylthio, hydroxy, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or cyan, A alkylene with 1 to 4 of carbon atoms mean that when R₄ is different from cyan, a 1,2- ethylene and R₁ is hydrogen, including their acid addition salts, methods for their preparation, compounds containing these compounds and their use. The new active ingredients serve to control pathogenic microorganisms on veterinary fields. They are effective for airgel diseases of poultry and infections of the intestinal tract and the urogenital area of ​​house and livestock. In addition, they are suitable as a feed additive to promoting animal growth. The active ingredients may be applied orally, abomasal or injection according to their application via or in combination with common inert carriers in solid or liquid form.
