<ABSTRACT>
an electrode and carrier assembly is disclosed for  attachment to a biological subject, such as a fetus during labor  and delivery to monitor the fetal heart rate.  the electrode  structure includes a clip-like body having clamping portions  (16, 18) and members (23) adapted to engage cam surfaces  (36, 38) within a carrier (12).  while the electrode structure is  housed within the carrier the clamping portions are held  apart.  attachment is accomplished by placing the carrier  against the subject and moving the members into engageÂ­ ment with the cam surfaces, whereby the cam surfaces eject  the electrode structure from the carrier by the cam action thus  allowing the clamping portions thereof to clamp onto the  subject's skin.  the carrier may then be removed completely,  leaving only the electrode structure with its associated wiring  (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
clip electrodes the present invention relates to electrodes, and more particularly to an electrode, and carrier therefor, suitable for attachment to a fetus during labor and delivery to monitor the fetal heart rate. it is desirable to monitor the fetal heart rate continuously during labor and delivery in order to obtain an immediate indication of the presence of undue distress or danger to the fetus. devices attached external to the mother's body have proven inadequate for this purpose because they do not clearly distinguish the fetal heart rate from that of the mother. therefore, various devices have been developed for attachment directly to the fetus during labor. an early device of this type consisted of a "c" shaped wire, insulated except at the opposed tips thereof, which was inserted into the uterus and attached to the fetal scalp manually or by a forcep. this device was difficult to manipulate and insert, and did not attach securely to the fetus. later devices were developed that screwed into the skin, such as those disclosed in hon et al u.s. patent no. re. 28,990 and ruttgers patent no. 3,750,650. tachick u.s. patent no. 3,472,234 discloses another screw-type electrode. these devices require a manual attachment technique that is unusual and difficult for a physician to perform. other intrauterine fetal monitoring devices have taken various forms. egan u.s. patent no. 3,326,207 discloses a pair of contact electrodes mounted on balloons. lacroix u.s. patent no. 3,580,242 discloses a barbed, fishhook-like electrode inserted by a forcep. hunter, jr. et al, u.s. patent no. 3,120,227 discloses a spring steel electrode having forcep-like branches that converge sharply to a point. a cylindrical sleeve must remain in the uterus to engage the branches and hold them together, making this device cumbersome to work with. in neward u.s. patent no. 3,989,038, there is disclose a clip-like fetal electrode having opposed jaws normally held together by spring tension, mounted on a long tube which may be removed after the electrode is attached to the fetus. attachment, however, is accomplished by manipulatic of one of the jaws through a rachet and cam assembly in a manner which may be awkward for a physician to perform while the electrode is inserted into the uterus. an alternate means for inserting an electrode into a body cavity is disclosed in kilpatrick u,s. patent no. 3,087,48e consisting of a tubular carrier sleeve containing a plunger which is depressed to drive the electrode into the tissue, after which the sleeve may be withdrawn from the body. the insertion sleeve, however, is disclosed in connection with a cardiac electrode, and is therefore quite rigid since it must penetrate the chest wall. a similar rigid penetration tool is disclosed in quint u.s. patent no. 3,416,534, but in connection with a helix-shaped cardiac electrode that is screwed into the myocardium and therefore has the same disadvantages as the screwtype electrodes described in the patents mentioned above. another cardiac electrode in the form of a spiral is disclosed in rasor et al,
