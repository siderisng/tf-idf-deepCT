<ABSTRACT>
in a method for isolating tank walls (1), on the tank walls  to be isolated are arranged isolating panels (4) from plastic  material which are finished on the outer side thereof with a  metal sheet (6) and are provided with openings (7) which are  pushed over pins (3) soldered to the tank wall, whereby on  said pins are screwed elements (3′, 3″) which press said  panels against the tank wall, and in the space between said  panels is injected a hardenable isolating foam (13) after  having laid an adhesive tape (15) on those edges lying next  to one another of said panels, to form said space.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method for isolating walls, particularly the tank walls from a ship, and panels and fasteners used thereby". thereby". this invention relates to a method for isolating the tank walls from a ship whereby said walls are to be coated with a thermally-isolating plastic foam. usually said plastic material is glued against the walls to be isolated which due to the narrow spaces usually available, is difficult to perform and also particularly unhealthy due to the emanations and vapours which are released by such work moreover difficulties are encountered when arranging large panels because relatively small deviations result in problems when joining said panels. the invention has not only for object to obviate the above drawbacks but also to provide an original solution to the following problems 1. minimizing the heat losses and avoi ding cool spots; 2. providing an isolating with suffi cient mechanical strength to allow .walking on the top surface of said isolating material, whereby further the material should be water-proof at the bottom thereof; 3. said isolating material having to be generally vapour-proof; 4. the isolating layer having to be mounted in very narrow places and actually by unskilled workers; 5. avoiding the use of dangerous mate rials or materials which are diffi cult to use; 6. making possible an easy injecting, and 7. making possible local repairs without difficulty. it is to be noted that in a ship the holds or tanks of which are to be isolated, said isolating is arranged on the bottom walls before lowering the tank bottom walls on the supports thereof. when said tanks have been positioned, the finishing and touching-up of said tanks is very difficult and laborious. to obviate the above drawbacks, according to the invention, on the tank walls to be isolated are arranged isolating panels from said plastic material which are finished on the outer side thereof with a metal sheet and are provided with openings which are pushed over pins soldered to the tank wall, whereby on said pins are screwed elements which press said panels against the tank wall, and in the space between said panels is injected a hardenable isolating foam after having laid an adhesive tape on those edges lying next to one another of said panels, to form said space. a feature of the method according to the invention lies in arranging inside said space between said isolating panels, against the tank wall to be isolated, a resilient strip from foam material wliich retains the pressure from the foam material to be injected and prevents the further flowing thereof. preferably the hardenable plastic material is injected in the space present between the isolating panels through said adhesive tape. the invention also relates to the isolating panels and fasteners used with the above-defined method. other details and features of the invention will stand out from the following description given by way of non limitative example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which figure 1 is a bottom view with parts broken

 claims.      1.    method for isolating the tank walls from a ship, whereby said walls are to be coated with a thermally-isolating plastic foam, in which on the tank walls to be isolated are arranged isolating panels from said plastic material which are finished on the outer side therof with a metal sheet and are provided with openings which are pushed over pins soldered to the tank wall, whereby on said pins are screwed elements which press said panels against the   tank    wall, and in the space between said panels is injected a hardenable isolating foam after having laid an adhesive tape on those edges lying next to one another of said panels, to form said space.      2    method as defined in claim 1, which further comprises arranging inside said   spacebseen    said isolating panels, against the tank wall to be isolated, a resilient strip from foam material which retains the pressure from the foam material to be injected and prevents the futrher flowing thereof.    3.   method    as defined in either one of claims 1 and 2, which comprises injecting said hardenable plastic foam into those spaces present between the isdating panels through said adhesive tapes.    4. panels for isolating a tank wall by a method as defined in any one of claims 1 to 3, which are comprised of a layer from isolating material with substantially cylindrical openings wherein can be pushed fasteners which are screwed on pins welded therefor on said tank wall.       5.    panels as defined in claim 4, in which  the panels size is so selected that between two panels lying next to one another is formed a space determined by the spacing between said pins, the width of which lies between 7 and 13   mm     6. fasteners for retaining isolating panels pressed against a wall to be isolated, which have a slightly conical cross-section with a centering ring canted towards the center line of said fasteners which are pushed over pins fastened to said wall and against which are pressed self-locking nuts which are screwed on the heads of said pins.    7. fasteners as defined in claim   6;    which are provided with a collar through which said fasteners press said isolating panels.    8. fasteners as defined in either one of claims 6 and 7, which are provided with an isolating plug with cover.
