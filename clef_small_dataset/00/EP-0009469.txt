<ABSTRACT>
self-propelled sprinkling apparatus, constituted by a hydraulic cylinder (1) and piston system connected to a rod (2) controlled in reciprocating motion by a flexible tube under water pressure (5), the cylinder (1) and the rod (2) being equipped with a forked (a, b, c) foot (3, 4), in such a manner that when the rod (2) leaves the cylinder, the feet (3, 4) are distanced from one another, and when the rod (2) re-enters, these two feet draw close to one another.  the feet are made in such a manner that in one direction they form a buttress on the ground while in the opposite direction they slide so as to make the device advance gradually and at the same time sprinkle the ground with the deflector (9).  means for automatic stopping (13, 14, 15, 16) and adjustment (12) of the advance of the sprinkling are also provided.  <image>
