<ABSTRACT>
decontamination washing or washing and biocidal treat­ ment of articles, including washing and sterilizing of surgical  instruments is effected in a single chamber (10).  air is deliv­ ered under pressure for injection at the bottom of the chamber  (10) through a plurality of inlets (52 to 58) positioned to provide  interaction of their horizontally oriented discharges including  formation of turbulent vortices.  upward movement of air cre­ ates vertically oriented cleaning turbulence.  spray means are  provided to remove loose soil before washing and to remove  soil separated by washing.  drainage removal of soil from the  chamber is verified by a drain probe.  steam sterilization at  pressures above atmospheric provides for sterilization at tem­ peratures of 120°c and higher.
