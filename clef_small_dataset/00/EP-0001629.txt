<ABSTRACT>
1.  water-soluble fibre-reactive green phthalocyanine azo dyestuff of the formula i  see diagramm : ep0001629,p25,f1  wherein pc is the radical of a metal-containing or metal-free phthalocyanine ; d and d' denote the phenylene, naphthylene, diphenyl, stilbene and phenylcarbamoylphenyl radicals, the disulphostilbene or disulphodiphenyl radical, it being possible for d and d' to be the same or different and, in the case of the phenylene or naphthylene radical, to be substituted with a -so3 h- or -cooh-group and, per nucleus, with a substituent selected from the group consisting of alkoxy having 1 to 2 carbon atoms or an additional -so3 h- or -cooh-group, with one or two halogen atoms which may be the same or different or with one to three alkyl radicals having one to two carbon atoms, which radicals may be the same or different ; b denotes the radical of an aliphatic hydrocarbon having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, the phenylene or naphthylene radical which may be substituted with a -so3 h- or -cooh-group and, per nucleus, with a substituent selected from the group consisting of alkoxy having 1 to 2 carbon atoms or an additional -so3 h- or -cooh-group, with 1 or 2 halogen atoms which may be the same or different or with 1 to 3 alkyl radicals having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, which radicals may be the same or different, and further denotes the disulphostilbene radical or disulphodiphenyl radical ; a denotes the radical of a fibre-reactive acylating component selected from the series comprising triazines, quinoxalines, phthalazines, pyridazines, pyrimidines or alpha,beta-unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids ; y denotes the vinyl, the beta-sulphato ethyl, the beta-phosphato ethyl, the beta-thiosulphato ethyl, the beta-dimethylamino ethyl and beta-diethylamino ethyl radicals ; r1 denotes hydrogen, carboxymethyl, sulphomethyl, an alkyl radical having 2 to 6 carbon atoms which may be substituted with cl, br, oh, alkoxy with 1 to 2 carbon atoms, -cooh or -so3 h, or denotes phenyl, it being possible for the aromatic nucleus to be substituted with cl, alkyl and/or alkoxy with 1 to 2 carbon atoms, alkanoylamino with 1 to 2 carbon atoms, -cooh, -conh2 , -so2 nh2 or -so3 h ; r2 denotes hydrogen, methyl, carboxymethyl, sulphomethyl, an alkyl radical with 2 to 6 carbon atoms which may be substituted with cl, br, oh, alkoxy having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, -cooh or -so3 h, or an unsubstituted alkyl radical having 6 to 20 carbon atoms ; r3 denotes methyl, carboxy, methoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl ; hal denotes chlorine, bromine or fluorine ; x denotes a direct bond and when d is a phenylene or a naphthylene, x may also be methylene or ethylene ; k denotes 1, 2 or 3 ; g denotes 0 or 1 ; m denotes 1, 2 or 3 ; n denotes 0 or 1 and p denotes 0 or 1, the sum of k, g and m being 3 or 4 and the sum of n and p being 1, their alkalimetal, ammonium or alkaline earth salts.
