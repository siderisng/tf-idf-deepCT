<ABSTRACT>
a jig, having two fixed jig faces (16a, 16b) forming a  right angle, is rotatably mounted on a guide rail (2) which  can slide in each of the linear grooves (3, 23) formed  parallel to and on opposite sides of a conventional woodcutting  saw table (4).  complementary cuts for the construction of mitered  corners are obtained by directing the apex of the jig along a  line parallel to the cutting blade (5).  the first cut is made  by supporting the wood on the appropriate jig face as it is  guided through the blade.  without changing its setting  relative to the guide rail.  the jig is transferred to the groove  on the opposite side of the blade and a second cut is made.
