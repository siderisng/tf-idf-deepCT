<ABSTRACT>
a metal strap segment is provided for forming a loop  about compressible material (18) and has a first joint-­ forming portion (20) on one end and a second joint-­ forming portion (22) on the other end, each of the joint-­ forming portions (20, 22) containing an array of longitudi­ nally spaced joint elements which are adapted to interlock  to form a sealless strap connection when the joint-forming  portions (20, 22) are overlapped.  an abutment (40) is pro­ vided at the distal end of the second joint-forming portion  (22) and a disengageable antireverse engaging means (50),  such as a tab or receiving aperture, is provided on the first  joint-forming portion (20).  the engaging tab or aperture  (50) is located, with respect to the distal end of the first  joint-formation portion (22), inwardly of and adjacent the  array of longitudinally spaced joint elements.  the engaging  tab or aperture (50) is also associated with the inner side  (34) of the strap (16) so that when the strap loop is placed  about the material (18) and is outwardly bowed, the abut­ ment is forced against the inner side (34) of the first joint-­ forming portion (20) and is aligned to engage the engaging  means to prevent disengagement of the connection when  the joint-forming portions (20, 22) are moved relative to  each other in a disengaging direction.  the connection is  easily disengaged, however, by orienting the overlapping  joint-forming portions (20, 22) in a generally inwardly  bowed position and then displacing one of the joint-­ forming portions (20, 22) longitudinally relative to the other  portion in the disengaging direction.
