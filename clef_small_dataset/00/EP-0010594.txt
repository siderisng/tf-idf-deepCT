<ABSTRACT>
1.  rotary resilient coupling for connecting two substantially co-axial torque-transmitting shafts, especially a steering column coupling for motor vehicles for disposition between the steering gear and the steering column, with an outer metallic sleeve (2), a co-axial metallic inner tube (3) spaced form the outer sleeve and a rubber component (4) adhesively bonded to the sleeve (2) and the inner tube (3) and filling the space between, the metallic sleeve (2) being provided over a part of its length (x) with opposed axially extending slots, which form stops for lugs (6, 7; 23, 24) projecting radially from the inner tube (3) into the slots, characterised in that, the metallic sleeve (2) is formed from a sheet metal component which is multi-edged in cross section, that the axially extending edges of the slots are turned inwards and have flanges (10, 11, 12, 13; 18, 19, 20, 21) embedded in rubber and that the lugs (6, 7; 23, 24) are formed on the inner tube (3).
