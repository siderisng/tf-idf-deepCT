<ABSTRACT>
a catalyst system for alpha-olefin type polymerizations  which comprises at least one metal alkyl compound having  the formula r₃‴m in combination with a titanium metal  compound on a support, at least one hindered lewis base  and a sterically hindered salt of a group i a to group iii b  metal wherein r‴ is c₁ to c₂₀ primary, secondary of tertiary  alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl groups or hydrogen and  m is aluminium, gallium or indium.  the improved catalyst  system provides polymers having increased isotactic  stereoregularity as well as lower catalyst residue.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to catalyst systems for the conventional alpha olefin type polymerization at significantly improved polymerization activity, wherein the resultant polymers have a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity. an object of the present invention is to provide improved catalyst systems having a major increase in polymerization activity while being able to control over a wide'range the polymer crystallinity, e.g., isotacticity, wherein the catalyst system includes a transition metal compound and a metal trialkyl compound of al, ga or in having at least one secondary or tertiary alkyl group. a further object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for alpha-olefin type polymerizations, wherein the polymerization activity is increased and the formed polymer has a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity and a minimum amount of catalyst residues are formed. a still further object of .the present invention is to use directly the new improved catalyst with various types of supported transition metal compounds without substantial modification of the commercial catalyst preparation or the polymerization plant. a still further object of the.+resent invention i- to provide new improved catalyst compositions wherein the isotacticity of the formed polymer is much less sensitive to a ratio of the cocatalyst (trialkyl metal compound) to the transition metal compound than when the corresponding primary alkyl compounds are used, thereby greatly facili tating process control to make higher quality polymers at more efficient production rates. additionally, another object of the present instant invention is to provide a process and compositions whereby r mr'2 or r2mr' are produced as cocatalysts in situ by the reactions: r2mg + r'alcl2 # r2alr' + mgc12 , or rmgx + r'2alcl ra1r'2 + mgxcl it is well known in the art to use an alkyl metal compound of groups i-iii in combination with a transition metal compound of groups iva-viii as a catalyst system for olefinic polymerization. while nearly all of the alkyl metal compounds are effective for the polymerization of ethylene, only a few are effective for the preparation of isotactic polymers of propylene and higher alpha olefins and only et2alc1, alet3 and i-bu2alh have any important commercial utility. a major cost involved in the polymerization of the alpha olefins is the cost of the catalyst components. therefore, the cost of the manufacture of the polymer can be effectively reduced by the use of catalyst systems having a higher polymerization activity. a further concern is the ability to produce polymers having a minimum amount of catalyst residues thereby eliminating a costly deashing operation. a still further concern is the ability to produce polymers having a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity thereby enabling the manufacturer to eliminate or reduce the costly operation involving the removal and separation of atactic polymer from the isotactic polymer. the improved catalyst system of the present invention provides a means for the manufacturer to obtain- ; these desirable realizations. the improved catalyst systems of the present invention which are employed in alpha olefin polymerizations include a group iva-viii transition metal compound, one
