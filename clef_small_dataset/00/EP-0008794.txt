<ABSTRACT>
polyphosphazene polymers are prepared which contain  repeating units represented by the formulas:    wherein x and x′ are the same or different and are rep­ resented by:    wherein r₁ is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen  and a methyl group; r₂ and r₃ are independently selected for  each carbon atom from a group consisting of hydrogen and  alkyl radical containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; 2 < m < 20;  x′ can additionally be selected from the group consisting of  substituted and unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy, amino and  mercapto radicals, and mixtures thereof, which are compat­ ible with an alkoxy acrylate substituent and are known in the  state of the art of polyphosphazene technology; and 20 < (w  + y + z) < 50,000 per polymer.  the polymers of the invention can be utilized to form  protective films and can also be utilized in applications such  as for molding, coatings, foams and the like.
