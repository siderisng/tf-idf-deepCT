<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus generates an electric signal to simulate  the output of a measuring apparatus, such as a thermocou足 ple, which is sensitive to a physical variable, such as tem足 perature, and which provides an output electric signal.  the  apparatus comprises a selector (11) for choosing the par足 ticular type of thermocouple to be simulated, a measuring  unit selector (12) to select the temperature scale to be  utilised, a selector (13) in the form of keyboard for selecting  the value of the temperature the measurement of which is to  be simulated and a computer circuit (14) which includes a  memory containing information concerning the type of  measuring apparatus that can be selected, and a converter  (15) controlled by the computer to supply a simulated out足 put signal to output terminals (6).
