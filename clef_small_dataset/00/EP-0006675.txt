<ABSTRACT>
in this arrangement, the pitching, rolling and steering  movements that take place between a motor car and a  trailer are separately accommodated, with the pitching  movements being accommodated by a cylindrical arti­ culation comprising two relatively moving parts, motion  therebetween occurring through elastic means.  means  are preferably provided for pre-stressing the elastic means  whereby weight may be taken off the rear axle of the car  to a desired extent and distributed to the front axle of the  car and to the trailer axle.  the rolling movements are  accommodated by a stub-shaft at the front of the trailer,  rotatably inserted into a longitudinally extending hori­ zontal hole provided in the second of the above moving  parts, and the steering movements are accommodated by  an eye at the rear end of the stub-shaft, pivotally engaged  in a fork-like member, carried by the trailer towbar, for  motion about a vertical axis.
