<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus is disclosed (figure 1) wherein one or  more articles are packaged as a unit by the wrapping of a film  (56) of shrinkable plastics material thereabout, the film being  provided as a continuous web.  the apparatus is adapted to  the packaging of plural articles arranged in a plurality of  rows.  the apparatus receives articles in nested rows and is  provided with means (14) for automatically bringing adjacent  articles into transverse alignment.  the articles are then  moved in clusters (c) to a wrapping station (40) where a  continuous film (56) is engaged over the top of each cluster  (c) and held in place by an upper conveyor (106) while at the  same time the cluster is being engaged by and supported by  a lower conveyor (68) which moves in unison with the upper  conveyor (106).  film drawing means (116) then moves down  between each pair of adjacent clusters and draws the  necessary film, after which the film is severed into individual  wraps followed by the directing of a rear bottom flap (64) into  underlying relation with respect to the rear part of the  cluster.  thereafter, the partially wrapped cluster is moved  onto a platform (66) wherein the front flap (62) is both tightly  drawn with respect to the cluster and positioned beneath the  cluster and the rear flap (64).  the apparatus also includes  spacer means (124) movable in between partially wrapped  adjacent clusters to stabilize and maintain the spacing  thereof.
