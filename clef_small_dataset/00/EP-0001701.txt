<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector for terminating a coaxial electrical  cable (1) comprising a centre conductor (2) and a concentric  outer conductor (3) spaced from the centre conductor (2) by a  layer of dielectric material (4), the connector comprising a  centre contact (6) for crimp connection to a bared end portion  of the centre conductor (2) of the cable (1), a conductive sleeve  (7) having a relatively small diameter first end portion (8)  adapted to be received between the dielectric layer (4) and an  exposed portion ferrule (9) for crimping about the outer conductor  portion of the cable on the first end portion (8) of the  conductive sleeve (7), a dielectric spacer sleeve (11) received  in a relatively large diameter second end portion (10) of the  conductive sleeve (7), and having a bore (12) to receive the  crimped centre contact (6), a cylindrical outer contact (18) in  electrical contact with the conductive sleeve (7) and a coupling  member (21) retained on the conductive sleeve (7) by  engagement between projections (23) on the conductive  sleeve (7) at the inner end of the second end portion (10)  thereof, and an inner end (20) of the outer contact (18), the  outer contact (18) being in frictional engagement with the  outer surface of the second end portion (10) of the conductive  sleeve (7).
