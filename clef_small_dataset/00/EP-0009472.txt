<ABSTRACT>
1.  multi-purpose constructional element, in particular heat exchanger, comprising a carrier (1, 10, 18) consisting of a flexible elongate sheet, wherein conduits (2, 12, 19) are disposed on the carrier, and the unit formed of the carrier and the conduits can be wound up around an axis extending transversely to the longitudinal axis of the carrier, characterized in that the carrier (1, 10, 18) consists of solid or latticed material, on or in which the conduits (2, 12, 19) are arranged extending in longitudinal direction of the carrier, the conduits being connected to the carrier or the carrier being designed with double walls, at least one wall portion being provided with grooves (11) or formed with a profile on the inner side facing the other wall portion, and the conduits being formed between the two wall portions of the double-walled carrier sealingly connected to each other at the places of contact, and that the unit formed of carrier (1, 10, 18) and conduits (2, 12, 19) is provided with a corrosion-protective layer and can be wound up around the axis extending transversely to the longitudinal axis of the carrier, maintaining a free cross-sectional area of the conduits.
