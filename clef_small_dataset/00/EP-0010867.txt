<ABSTRACT>
the assembly comprises a support mechanism (14,  14′, 15, 16) which supports the armrest (10) as a cantilever,  the mechanism comprising two parallel-action arms (14,  14′) pivoted at one end to an armrest-mounted member  (16) and at the opposite end to a seat-mounted member  (15), and a toothed coupling (20, 21) manually operable  to lock the mechanism at various selected heights of the  armrest.  an independently operable device (25) releases  the armrest for pivotal upward movement.
