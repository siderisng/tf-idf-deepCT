<ABSTRACT>
a water-conserving toilet is disclosed and includes a  bowl (36) for receiving waste and a waste outlet (40) extend­ ing laterally from the bowl (36) and defining a first, shallow  trap arranged so that a relatively shallow body of liquid is  normally retained in the bottom of the bowl (36) for prevent­ ing gaseous flow through the trap.  a flush system is pro­ vided and is arranged, when operated, to deliver a charge of  flushing liquid into the bowl (36) in a direction to cause said  body of liquid to be discharged through said outlet (40).  a  waste holding tank (42) communicates with said bowl outlet  (40) for receiving waste from the bowl (36) and the holding  tank (42) has an outlet (44) extending outwardly from the  tank (42) and adapted for connection to a sewer inlet.  the  holding tank outlet (44) defines a second trap of substantial  height capable of preventing reverse flow of sewer gas into  the holding tank (42) in use and the holding tank (42) and  second trap are arranged to contain a volume of liquid sub­ stantially in excess of the volume discharged from the bowl  (36) at each flush.  a flexible diaphragm (112) extends across  the holding tank (42) above the level at which liquid enters  from the bowl (36) and is sealed to the tank in gas-tight fash­ ion.  the diaphragm (112) is adapted to flex upwardly and  accommodate air displaced as liquid enters the tank (42)  from the bowl, (36) so as to minimize air resistance to flush­ ing of liquid from the bowl (36).
