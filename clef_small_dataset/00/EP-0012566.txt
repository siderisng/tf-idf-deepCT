<ABSTRACT>
electric windings comprise an electric conductor (1) and  a plurality of layers of a cured composite insulating material  (2) wrapped around the conductor.  the insulating material is  obtained by bonding two or more insulating material e. g.   glass cloth and mica sheet with a binder solution.  after wrap­ ping the insulating material is impregnated with a varnish of  an epoxy isocyanate resin, which is then cured.  in order that the winding shall have good water resis­ tance in addition to good thermal resistance, and mechanical  properties, the binder comprises a mixture of (a) a conden­ sation polymerization type silicone resin having hydroxyl  groups and (b) an addition polymerization type silicone resin.   the resin (a) preferably is 50 to 95% by weight of the binder  and preferably has a hydroxyl group content of 0. 2 to 1% by  weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
electric windings and production thereof" this invention relates to a winding for an electric rotating machine having a plurality of layers of a sheet-form composite insulating material wrapped around a conductor and a cured resin impregnated into said layers, said cured resin being an epoxy isocyanate varnish, said sheet-form composite insulating material comprising two or more sheet-form insulating materials bonded by a binder. the invention also relates to a process for producing such a winding. recently, there has been a strong desire for electric windings having excellent thermal resistance, electrical and mechanical properties, good water resistance and the like. thisesire is related to the enlargement of capacity or miniaturization and weight saving in electric rotary machines and the like, or to the use of electric machines under severe conditions. in order to meet such demands, there has been proposed a process for producing electric windings having thermal resistance in the range of class h to class c by forming an insulating wrapping layer of glass-backed mica tape bonded by a silicone binder, impregnating the insulating wrapping layer with a solvent-less silicon resin varnish and curing it, but the resulting electric windings have been found insufficient in thermal resistance and water resistance. in order to avoid such defects, the present inventors have proposed a process for producing electric windings by forming a composite insulating material using a condensation polymerization type silicone resin having hydroxyl groups in the molecule as a binder, impregnating the composite insulating material with an epoxy-isocyanate series resin and curing it into one piece (u.s. patent application serial no. 38,424). the condensation polymerization type silicone resin bonds individual insulating materials remarkably well by the action of the hydroxyl group and is an excellent binder. since it has siloxane bonds in the backbone chain of the silicone resin, it has good thermal resistance. also since it is much more permeable to gas than other organic materials used for this purpose, it can release agas out of the insulating layer even if the gas is generated by thermal deterioration, so that delamination of the insulating layers is hardly caused at all by storage of the gas. a further advantage of this resin type is that the hydroxyl groups of the silicone resin readily react with the isocyanate in the impregnating varnish of epoxyisocyanate series resin to give a strongly bonded insulating layer. recently, however, it was found that electric windings so produced still have insufficient water resistance for practical use. this reason for this is not clear but it seems possible that heated unreacted hydroxyl groups bring about dehydration, dealcoholization, and dehydrogenation, which results in delamination of insulating layers and causes cracks. in order to improve the water resistance, the combined use of a coupling agent and a surface active agent was examined but adequate results were not obtained. it is an object of this invention to provide electric windings having class h thermal resistance (1800c) or more and good water resistance. the invention as claimed is intended to provide
