<ABSTRACT>
A system for transmitting signals between a television camera 3 is proposed and the control unit 4 connected to it via light line Ter 1, 2.In this system, some tone signals, such as understanding signals, amplitude modulated and each frequency modulated with an unanim tone signal.These frequency-modulated signals are then pulse modulated with the video signal together with the video signal, wherein this pulse modulated signal mixture is modulated the light of a laser 6, 9, soft to a photodiode 8, 7 arranged in the counter station is transmitted via light conductor 1, 2.Finally, the pulse modu converted by the photodiode 8, 7 into electrical signals is demodulated signal mixture in reverse order and demodulating the modulation type.
