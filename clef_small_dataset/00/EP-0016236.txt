<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed an automatic control system for limit足 ing the operating temperature of a diesel engine (10) having a  shutdown lever (52) that repositions the rack of its fuel pump  (12) to a shut down position that closes the pump metering  valves and shuts off the fuel supply to the engine.  the system  includes a pyrometer (24) to sense the exhaust gas tempera足 ture from the engine and generate a signal therefrom, a temp足 erature controller (30) having an adjustable, maximum set  point temperature to receive the signal from the pyrometer  (24) and to generate a control signal which is applied to a  control valve (102) in a fluid pressure line (99) which applies  a fluid pressure to a pressure responsive actuator (82) that  moves the shut down lever (52) a fraction of its full travel  necessary for shut down and thereby repositions the fuel  pump rack to a throttling position in response to a sensed  exhaust gas temperature which exceeds the preselected max足 imum set point temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
diesel engine control means a common cause of damage and excessive wear of internal combustion engines results from excessive combustion temperatures in the engine. the operational temperature of the engine can rapidly exceed a safe operational limit by improper operation where the engine is overloaded at any speed, requiring overthrottling and an excessive rate of fuel injection. this often occurs when driving a diesel-powered vehicle into unnoticed head or side winds or climbing unnoticed grades, or failing to notice changes in ambient pressure resulting from altitude changes or high ambient temperatures. additionally, malfunctions in the engine and its accessory equipment such as in the fuel supply system or fuel injectors, improper timing, turbocharger, restricted air cleaner, leak in a cross over tube, etc. can also cause an improper supply of fuel to the engine and result in an excessive operational temperature of the engine. when the temperature of an engine exceeds a safe operational temperature, even for periods of relatively short duration, the damage that can be expected includes burned valves, head gasket failures, engine block distortion, cracked manifold and cylinder heads, burning and scoring of pistons, carbon deposits behind piston rings and on injector tips, piston ring failure with resultant high oil consumption and blow by, lubrication oil dilution, cracks in the turbocharger unit and expansion of aluminium pistons resulting in aluminium deposits on cylinder walls and piston sizure. it is generally recognized that the engine temperature of a diesel engine is critically affected by the aforementioned operational or equipment defects. as a result, many diesel engines are provided with pyrometers to monitor the exhaust gas temperature of the engine. some of the pyrometers have been equipped with visual or audible warning signal generators to alert the operator when the exhaust gas temperature exceeds a predetermined, safe operational level. these devices are not entirely satisfactory since the warning signals can be inadvertently or deliberately ignored during operation of the engine. since operations of relatively short durations at excessive temperatures can have disastrous effects on the engine, any failure to take corrective steps immediately upon indication of an excessive exhaust gas temperature, can result in an expensive and time comsuming engine overhaul. unmanned engines present similar problems. in prior patent applications there are disclosed and claimed control systems for a conventional turbocharged and normally aspirated diesel engine using a controlled fuel by-pass, and for turbocharged diesel engines having air-fuel ratio controllers using a controlled application intake manifold pressure to the ratio controllers. there is also disclosed in u.s. patent 3,605,711 a hydraulic control system which adjusts the position of a fuel rack in an on-off, non-proportional manner. none of these prior systems are particularly adaptable to diesel engines which lack simple provisions to by-pass fuel or lack air-fuel ratio controllers. this invention comprises an automatic temperature control system for use on a diesel engine. a pressure responsive actuator is linked to the shut down lever of the engine and has a limited travel to decrease, but not entirely shut off,
