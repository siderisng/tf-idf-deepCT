<ABSTRACT>
a cylindre head for turning up flexible material particularly synthetic guts for producing sausages, facilitates the withdrawl of the turn up part and subsequently avoids the deteriorations, since its diameter is adjustable within the sector comprising the turn up part.  preferably, the cylindre head comprises a plurality of spring elements, in particular round spring steel wires (15) distributed about its axis; these springs may be spaced radially from each other above the surfaces of the lugs (25, 26), by means of an elongated working member (17) which may moove inside the head of the cylindre.  such a head of cylindre may be used either manually or mechanically and makes possible a permanent supply of high pressure air into the gut to be turned up, thereby improving the working member (17) as a hollow tube.
