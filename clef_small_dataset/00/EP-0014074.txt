<ABSTRACT>
a combined brake pad wear and fluid level detection  system comprises four sensor loops (18, 20), (21, 22) emb足 edded respectively in four brake pads (16) and connected  in series with resistors (r1, r2), between lines (26, 30).  a  switch (24) operated by a float positioned in the brake fluid  reservoir is connected in parallel with the resistor (r1).  a  pair of comparators (32, 34) detect the voltage at the junc足 tion of resistor (r2) and loop (18) and drive an indicator  lamp (40) through a delay circuit (d4, r8, c2), a further  comparator (38), and a transistor (t1).  a switch (42) oper足 ated by hand brake (43) is also connected in series with a  lamp (40).  the lamp (40) is energised during each braking  operation when the wear to one of the brake pads (16) has  reached its working limit (19), the delay circuit (r8, c2,  d4) preventing such energisation at other times.  on break足 age of one of the sensor loops, or upon closure of the  switch (24), or upon operation of the handbrake (43), the  lamp (40) is energised permanently.
