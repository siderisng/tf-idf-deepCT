<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to apparatus for providing ink feed  to a printing press.  an inking-unit attachment for a printing press includes a  fountain roller (30), a ductor roller (32) for rocking movement  between the fountain roller (30) and a receiver roller (34) an  idler roller (28) in the nip between the receiver roller (34) and  an oscillator roller (26), and a pair of form rollers (22) for  transferring ink from the oscillator roller (26) to the plate  cylinder (20) of the printing press.  the receiver (34) and oscillator rollers (26) rotate at dif­ ferent peripheral speeds to provide a skidding action bet­ ween one or both of such rollers and the idler roller (28) to  provide an even distribution and an increased quantity of ink  to the oscillator roller.  a three-function cam serves to reciprocate the oscillator  roller (26), in an axial direction, rock the ductor roller (32)  between positions in engagement with the fountain (30) and  receiver (34) rollers respectively, and intermittently to drive  the fountain roller (30).  the form rollers (22) are movable  between a position in the nip between the oscillator roller  (26) and plate cylinder (20), a position spaced from the plate  cylinder (20) and engaged with the oscillator roller (26), and a  lift position spaced from both the plate cylinder and oscil­ lator roller.  the inking-unit attachment (18) is adapted to be  releasably hung on the frame of the printing press (10) and to  be driven from the plate-cylinder gear on the printing press  through a shaft affixed to the plate-cylinder frame, where the  shaft has an overload clutch to guard personnel from injury  and the unit from damage
