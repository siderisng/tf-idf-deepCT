<ABSTRACT>
heat pump apparatus and method for increasing the  heat content of a fluid and thereafter transferring the heat  content to an ambient atmosphere, the heat pump apparatus  employing a continuous loop passageway (10) containing a  plurality of freely movable, unrestrained bodies (12).  the  bodies (12) are accelerated around the passageway (10) in  one direction by adiabatic expansion of a fluid between the  bodies (12) in an expander region.  the expanded cooler fluid  is discharged from the passageway (10) via one or more  vent-intake ports (16, 18) beyond the expander region.   warmer fluid enters the passageway (10) via said ports  (16, 18) and is compressed between the propelled bodies (12)  in a compression region.  the compressed, warmer fluid is  thereafter passed through a heat exchanger (22) to extract  heat.  then the bodies (12) pass through a thruster region  wherein a force is applied to the bodies (12) to counterbalance  the external forces acting against the bodies (12) as  they move around the passageway (10).  from the thruster  region the bodies (12) pass to an expander region to repeat  the cycle.  from the heat exchanger (22) fluid, typically  together with additional compressed fluid from an external  source, is introduced into the expander region to again  accelerate the bodies (12).
