<ABSTRACT>
containers made of flexible material often have opening  arrangements in the form of a tear strip for opening an outlet  aperture.  the tear strip constitutes a part of the container wall  and is limited by a weakening line (9).  to facilitate initiation of  the tear-open operation a short length of the weakened line  has the form of a cut (16) or cuts extending fully through the  material.  two or more cuts may form a lug or projection, and if  located at a fold line of the container blank the lug of projection  may be arranged to automatically extend outwards from  the finished container.
