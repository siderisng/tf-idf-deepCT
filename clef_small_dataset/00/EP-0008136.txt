<ABSTRACT>
1.  holder for an annular deflection yoke fitted round the neck of a cathode ray tube and opening like a trumpet towards the picture screen, with a securing part attached to the further end of the deflection yoke, characterized in this, that the securing part consists of two rings, the first ring (1), fitted round the wider end of the deflection yoke, being axially displaceable in relation to it, pivotable around it and fixable in relation to it and comprising, at its end turned towards the picture screen, a recess which forms a contact surface with the second ring and widens towards the picture screen, that the second ring (2) is fitted between the first ring and the tube cone (3), is firmly connected to the tube cone (3) and, at its surface of contact with the first ring (1) is fitted to it in its shape, the two rings being made so as to be movable and rotatable in relation to each other and comprising means (5) for fixing them to each other in each of the possible positions.
