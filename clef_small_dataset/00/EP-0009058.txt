<ABSTRACT>
A facade maintenance platform suspension device comprises a capstan formed of four pairs of pulleys (4A, 5A, 4B, 5B, 4C, 5C, 4D, 5D). These drums or pulleys are driven by the electric motor (13). They have gorges to receive the cables each of which is wound on a pair of pulleys in five turns. On the side of the soft strand, each cable is guided on a slicing device (3) and then goes to a coil (1) which is mounted via friction couplings on a shaft (2). The latter is driven by the motor (13) during climb while during the descent of the nacelle, it is blocked by a unidirectional coupling, the wheel of treatment (15) being then free on the shaft (2 ) A safety trip of safety trigger intended to intervene in the event of a decrease in the traction force given by the friction is combined with the trenching device. If the voltage on the soft strand decreases below a given threshold, a safety trigger interrupts the arrival of the current to the motor and involves the genetic electroma brake on which this member is equipped.
