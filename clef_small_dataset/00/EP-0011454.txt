<ABSTRACT>
an integratable circuit is disclosed for monitoring the  voltage across a sensing resistor (16) in series with a load  (10) e. g.  motor vehicle lights for providing a warning (26) in  the event of a failure.  a power supply line (28) feeds two  reference current circuits (34, 36) in which the currents are  both temperature-dependent supply voltage-dependent.  a  voltage-stabilising circuit (32) supplies the line (28) and has a  temperature coefficient such as to offset the changes in a  reference current due directly to changes in temperature and  in the temperature-responsive voltage on the line (28).  a  current-repeater (42) receives one of the reference currents  (34) and provides an output which is dependent both on the  reference current and on the potential difference across the  sensing resistor (16).  a comparator (50, 52) compares the  output with the other reference current (36) and provides an  output signal indicating whether the potential difference  across the resistor (16) is above or below a predetermined  value.
