<ABSTRACT>
ac control apparatus includes a plurality of selectable  switches (11) connected to a tapped load (10) and arranged  to alter the magnitude of the volt-amp product consumed  by the load.  the switches (11) are activated by  control means which includes a zero current detector (12),  a decision circuit (14) and switching logic (13).  the  switching logic is responsive to a decision in the decision  circuit and to the detector (14) to change switch at zero  switch current.  the decision circuit (14) may be made responsive to  an input or load parameter, and where the tapped load  (10) comprises a tapped transformer having an output for  connection to an external load, the parameter may be a  function of the output voltage.  the switches (11) as preferably  semiconductor devices such as triacs.  as an alternative,  the tapped load may comprise a motor.
