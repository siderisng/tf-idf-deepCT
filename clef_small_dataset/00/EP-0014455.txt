<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to Cyclopropane (thiol) carboxylic acid esters of the general formula <image> wherein R¹ is lower alkyl, with halogen substituted lower alkyl, low alkenyl, low alkynyl, cyan or phenyl, wherein the phenyl radical optionally with halogen, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, aethoxy and / or nitro may be substituted; R² hydrogen, halogen, alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, alkoxy having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, alkenyloxy with 3 or 4 carbon atoms, alkynyloxy with 3 or 4 carbon atoms or nitro; R³ hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or alkoxy having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; x oxygen or sulfur; m the number 0, 1, 2 or 3; and n the number 0 or 1; mean and one of the two rings A and B or both may be saturated; however, the two symbols M and N are not at the same time representing the number o; With the mass that the two symbols R² and R³ are not at the same time hydrogen when X is oxygen and M, and the methylene group carrying the cyclopropane (thiol) carboxylic acid resistant is linked to the β-position of the naphthalene residue, process for their preparation; Pesticides containing these compounds as active ingredients as well as the use of such compounds and means for controlling pests.
