<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a temperature responsive  actuating device using the volumetric expansion of a subst­ ance (2) with high coefficient of expansion to expel a piston  (10) from a cylinder (1), wherein this substance is located in  the cylinder (1) between end plugs (3,4) and the piston (10)  passes through one of the end plugs (4) by means of a shaft  seal (12).  the invention is characterised in that the piston (10)  bears axialiy with its outboard end upon an inboard end of a  push rod (25) which can be moved separately from and  independently of the piston (10) and which is guided for axial  sliding movements, generally in line with the axis of  movements performed by the piston (10), this push rod (25)  being connected and arranged to transmit control forces  between the piston (10) and a high leverage operating  linkage operatively interconnecting the piston (10) with a  second load element, the cylinder (1) being connected to a  first load element.

<DESCRIPTION>
temperature responsive actuating device this invention relates to temperature responsive devices of the kind utilizing the volumetric expansion of substances or compositions having high coefficients of thermal expansion. typical of such substances are waxes or jellies, and in particular a mixture of paraffin wax and petroleum jelly. the volumetric expansion and contraction of such substances occurring when there is a change in the ambient temperature is employed to operate mechanisms such as bell cranks or linkages, say for controlling ventilators, windows, fanlights, shutters, valves and so forth. temperature responsive actuating devices which utilize the volumetric expansion and contraction of a substance have been proposed for example in united states patent specification no. 4 140 017. such a device essentially includes a straight tubular cylinder containing the substance and immersed in said substance a rod which is constituted as a piston and extends into the cylinder through a close fitting guide means incorporating a shaft seal. the piston passes through a bush which constitutes a means for allowing controlled axial sliding movement to the piston. this bush incorporates the shaft seal means engaging about the piston rod. the rod extends axially out of one end of the cylinder and is connected to the ventilator pane, for example by means of a linkage. this piston must be of a diameter such that on the one hand adequate shaft sealing is obtained (this limiting the minimum dimension) while if the piston is large in relation to the diameter of the cylinder, there will be inadequate axial piston movement for a given volumetric change consequent upon change of ambient temperature. in use the cylinder is adapted to be connected rigidly to a fixed frame with respect to which the ventilator pane is movable. for example the ventilator pane may be a window pivoted on the frame. the linkage is arranged to transmit to the movable pane the axial movements performed by the piston rod, on expansion or contraction of the temperature responsive substance contained within the cylinder. the linkage is arranged to transmit these movements at a high leverage of say 10 : 1 or more (with 1 cm of piston movement corresponding to at least 10 cm of movement of the movable pane relative to the fixed frame). if then a force of 10 kg is required to move the window pane, a corresponding force of 100 kg must be exerted on and by the piston. the piston rod is then required to move axially when subjected to high axial loadings transmitted through the linkage. the bush incorporating the shaft seal supports such axial sliding movement of the piston rod and the shaft seal prevents the escape of the thermally expansive substance from within the cylinder. this substance is commonly a mixture of paraffin wax and petroleum jelly upon expanding it may generate pressures of 35mn/mê or more. the shaft seal bears tightly upon the piston and so contributes frictional forces which have to be overcome when the piston is moved axially. however,
