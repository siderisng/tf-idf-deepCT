<ABSTRACT>
stacking apparatus for stacking banknotes or other  sheets includes a single slotted-wheel (14) that is rotated to  receive sheets (n) fed successively thereto.  the sheets are  retained in slots (13) of the wheel (14) so as to be carried  round with the wheel (14) into abutment with stripper means  (16) which dislodges the sheets from the slots (13) so that  they stack one upon the other (s).  the stripper means has  abutments on both sides of the single wheel (14), and may be  a plate (16) which is slotted to extend up on both sides of the  wheel to provide said abutments and which also provides an  abutment against which the stripped sheets fall in register  upon one another in orderly stack (s).  the wheel (14) may be  a plastics moulding with the slots defined by individual  curved-tines (19) moulded as one with the remainder of the  wheel, and may be mounted centrally of the sheet-feed path.
