<ABSTRACT>
a continuous length of sheet material is fed until its  leading edge is detected and is then stopped and clamped.   after than an intermediately positioned tensioning and  folding means draws out under tension further material from  the stop feed mechanism.  this sets up the material for  transverse clamping and severing of the already folded  lengths.  the transverse severing is preferably effected by  deflecting the material into the path of a band knife parallel  to the material face.  the severed and folded unit length can  be further progressed, either folded or partly completed  unfolded e. g.  to a cut-and-lay stack or to suitable sewing  heads.
