<ABSTRACT>
this invention is directed to a water-thinnable coating  composition comprising a water-miscible solvent, a water-­ soluble acidified aminoalkylated vinyl interpolymer and an  epoxy resin.  the important feature of this invention is that the  aminoalkylated vinyl interpolymer is acidified with hydrob­ romic acid optionally containing up to 30 mole percent hyd­ rochloric acid.  the coating compositions of this invention  demonstrate excellent cure rates even under cool and/or  damp conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
water-thinnable coating compositions from am inoalkylated interpolymers water-thinnable epoxy coating compositions have been prepared using, as curing agents, aminoethylated vinyl polymers acidified with hydrochloric acid or various monocarboxylic acids. such compositions cure under ambient conditions when those conditions are warm and dry. however, they do not cure in acceptable times when the conditions are cool and/or damp as is a common occurrence when exterior coatings are to be applied. a need exists for a composition that will cure under adverse conditions. the present invention is directed to a water -thinnable coating composition comprising a water -miscible solvent, a water-soluble acidified aminoalkylated vinyl interpolymer and an epoxy resin characterized in that the aminoalkylated vinyl interpolymer is acidified with hydrobromic acid optionally containing up to 30 mole percent hydrochloric acid. preferably, the interpolymer is acidified with a mixture of 80 mole percent hydrobromic acid and 20 mole percent hydrochloric acid. the coating compositions of this invention demonstrate excellent cure rates even under cool and/or damp conditions. vinyl interpolymers containing carboxylic acid groups useful in this invention are generally prepared from a solution of a mixture of monomers, one of which is a vinyl carboxylic acid monomer. the monomer mixture is polymerized in the presence of a catalyst and usually under controlled elevated temperatures with agitation until the polymerization reaction is complete. various modifications commonly practiced with solution polymerization reactions can be utilized; modifications such as stepwise addition of the monomer mixture during the polymerization; incremental addition of catalyst, polymerization under an inert atmosphere and continuous or batch polymerization. the details of such polymerization are well known and need not be discussed further herein. suitable vinyl carboxylic acid monomers include ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as methacrylic acid, atropic acid (alpha-phenyl acrylic acid), angelic acid (cis-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid) and tiglic acid (trans-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid). it is important that the carbon alpha to the carboxylic acid group bear no hydrogen atom. preferably, the vinyl carboxylic acid is methacrylic acid. the vinyl interpolymer is prepared by copolymerizing a vinyl carboxylic acid with one or more copolymerizable monomers such as, for example, vinyl aromatic monomers, alkyl esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, dialkyl esters of unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, vinyl and vinylidene chloride and fluoride and n-vinyl pyrrolidone. suitable vinyl aromatic monomers include styrene, a-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, the various alkyl-substituted styrenes, the various halo-substituted styrenes and vinyl naphthalene. the more preferred of these monomers are styrene, a-methylstyrene and vinyltoluene. suitable alkyl esters of unsaturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids include the esters prepared from aliphatic alcohols containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and from cyclohexyl alcohol with the vinyl carboxylic acids cited previously. the acrylic and methacrylic esters are preferred; most preferred of these monomers are methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl and 2-ethylhexyl acrylates or methacrylates. various amounts of acrylonitrile, or methacrylonitrile, less than 40 percent, may also be used to improve the film properties. the vinyl interpolymers are preferably prepared with a sufficient amount of a vinyl carboxylic acid monomer to provide from 1 to 20 percent by weight of carboxylic
