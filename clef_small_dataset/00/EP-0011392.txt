<ABSTRACT>
a photothermographic silver halide composition is pro­ vided which is capable of being coated on a support.  the  composition comprises a hydrophilic photosensitive silver  halide emulsion containing a gelatino peptizer with an  organic solvent mixture, a hydrophobic binder and an  oxidation-reduction image-forming composition comprising  (i) a silver salt of a long-chain fatty acid with (ii) an organic  reducing agent.  the solvent mixture comprises (a) a benzyl  alcohol or a 2-phenoxyethanol photographic speed-­ increasing solvent and (b) an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent  that is compatible with said photographic speed-increasing  solvent and, optionally, (c) 0 to 10% by weight of the solvent  mixture of a hydrophobic binder.  the described photother­ mographic composition can be prepared by very thorough  mixing, such as by ultrasonic wave mixing.  the preferred  hydrophobic binder is poly(vinyl butyral).
