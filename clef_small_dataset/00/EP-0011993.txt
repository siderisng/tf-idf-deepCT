<ABSTRACT>
arc tubes (10) for high pressure, metal halide, electric  discharge lamps comprise a tube (11) of ceramic material, for  example alumina, having end portions (12) of smaller cross-sectional  area than the intermediate portion of the tube.  cermet  end closures (14) of corresponding coss-section are sealed  to the tube ends and carry electrodes (17) and leads (18)  which are each inserted into an area of electrically conductive  cermet to make connection between them.  the reduced  cross-section of the tube ends and closures reduces heat  losses due to radiation and enables a higher 'cool spot temperature'  to be maintained.  it also minimizes loss of volatile  substances during the operation of final sealing of the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
electric discharge lamps this invention relates to electric discharge lamps and more especially to the provision of improved ceramic arc tubes for high pressure, metal halide lamps. discharge lamps operating at relatively low power but with high efficacy, for example low power, high pressure metal halide lamps, have of necessity a high power loading (watts per unit arc length) and a high power density (watts per unit arc tube volume). the arc tube walls consequently attain a high operating temperature and silica is not a satisfactory material for the tube if the lamp is to have a long life. ceramic materials, for example alumina, can withstand a high temperature, are chemically less reactive than silica, can easily be made in small sizes and are therefore suitable for use in this type of lamp. one of the problems facing the designer of a high pressure metal halide lamp intended for operation at low power is that of achieving adequate partial pressures of the metal halides. this generally requires a relatively high minimum arc tube temperature (cool spot temperature), which becomes progressively more difficult to achieve as the designed input power of the lamp is reduced. heat conservation thus becomes increasingly more important as the desired operating power is reduced, and these arc tubes are operated in evacuated outer envelopes or bulbs to reduce the loss of heat by conduction and convection from the surfaces of the tube. with these losses reduced to a minimum the main cause of heat loss is radiation from the hot arc tube. the equilibrium temperature of any part of the arc tube is determined by the balance between the inflow and outflow of heat, and in regions remote from the discharge (for example, in the vicinity of the seals, where the cool spot is usually situated) heat losses are due mainly to radiation, and increase with increasing temperature, surface area and emittance of the material employed. for example, in conventional fused silica arc tubes the large area of the pinch seals, which have high emittance, limits the cool spot temperatures that can be attained. in the case of ceramic tubes, we have now found that cermet materials which may be used to seal the tube also exhibit high emittance, and notably a higher emittance than that of the ceramic materials themselves. a further problem in ceramic lamps of small dimensions is that of making the final seal without loss of volatile fill substances. sealing involves heating parts of the arc lamp to a high temperature, perhaps even above 16000c, with the dose only about a centimetre away. we have found upon investigation that in the early stages of the sealing process the transfer of heat to the doses of volatile substances is mainly due to direct radiation from the heat region. the present invention is concerned with the design of ceramic arc tubes in which heat losses from the tube ends are reduced and cool spot temperature increased. the invention is also concerned to provide arc
