<ABSTRACT>
1.  a fencing constructed by means of posts (2, 2a) each obtained from a polygonal-sectioned element (6) having a plane of symmetry (xx) in the front surface of which is formed a groove (7) having an inwardly divergent section for fastening at an adjustable level by means of a bolt (19) screwed into a nut (21) engaged in the groove, an attachment (13) through which the bolt extends and which is clamped against said front surface for mounting fencing equipment (4) such as wire-netting, trellis-work, taut wires, etc. . . , characterised in that the groove (7) of each post (2, 2a) has a dovetail shape and the fencing equipment (4) is fixed, on one hand, at least on the end posts (2a) which may be anchoring posts, by means of attachments (13) each of which is connected to the corresponding post by a bolt (19) screwed into a nut (21) anchored in the dovetail groove (7) of this post, on the other hand, on other posts (2) by means of u-shaped fasteners (34) whose web (36) overlaps at least a fencing equipment wire and whose ends are so shaped that, when they are engaged in the groove (7), they are embedded therein by a resilient deformation and retained therein by a wedging in contact with the sides (7a) of the groove.
