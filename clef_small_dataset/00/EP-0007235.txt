<ABSTRACT>
reversible transmission for driving the propeller of a ship  from a unidirectional drive in both directions through a first  and a second shaft having the propeller associated therewith  and being drivingly connectable with said first shaft either  directly through a clutch or a planetary transmission having  its sun gear affixed to said first shaft, a plurality of planet gears  meshing with said sun gear, and a ring gear meshing with said  planet gears, and its planet gears rotatably disposed in a  planet carrier with braking means to stop rotation of said  planet carrier when activated for reversing the direction of  rotation of said second shaft and the propeller, characterized  in that said second shaft (11) is concentric with said first shaft  (7) and has said clutch (37) disposed at one end so as to cause  said first and second shafts (7 and 11) to rotate in the same  direction when said clutch is engaged and that said braking  means (27) which is associated with said planet carrier (25) is  disposed at the free end of said first shaft (7).
