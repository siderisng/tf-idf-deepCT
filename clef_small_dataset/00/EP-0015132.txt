<ABSTRACT>
a new crystalline zeolitic material, designated zsm-48,  the composition of which expressed in terms of moles per 100  moles of silica, usually falls within the range:   (0 to 15)rn : (0 to 1. 5)m₂/n0 : (0-2)al₂0₃ : (100)sio₂ wherein m  is at least one cation having a valence n, rn is a c₁-c20 organic  compound, having at least one amine functional group of  pka≧7.  zsm-48 is characterized by the distinctive x-ray pow­ der diffraction pattern shown in table i, and is prepared from a  reaction mixture comprising a source of silica, c₁-c₂₀ organic  compounds as defined above, with or without a source of  alumina, and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
crystalline zeolitic material, sthesis and use thereof this invention relates to a new crystalline zeolitic material, to a method for synthesising it, and to its use, inter alia as organic conversion catalyst. many crystalline zeolites are mown, in most cases as aluminosilicates. some occur (at least so far) only in nature, for instance paulingite and merlinoite; some occur only as a result of synthesis, for instance zeolites a and zsm-5; and some occur in both natural and synthetic forms, for instance mordenite, a synthetic counterpart of which is known as zeolon, and faujasite, synthetic counterparts of which are known as zeolites x and v, counterparts are of course demonstrated as such by correspondence of their x-ray diffraction data, the indicia by means of which the individuality of a zolite is established. such data are a manifestation of the particular geometry of the three-dimensional lattice, formed of sio6 and in most cases al04 tetrahedra crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms and including sufficient cationic complement to balance the resulting negative charge on any a104 tetrahedra, of which a zeolite may consist. the chemical formula of an aluminosilicate zeolite is thus mx/n: (a102)x: (sio2)y where m is a cation of valence n and x and y are the number of aluminum and silicon atoms, respectively, in the unit cell (the geometric unit which repeats throughout the extent of the lattice). this expression is however frequently transmuted into the "mole ratio of oxides1' form, m2/no: a1203:2y/x sic2 which is of course empirically ascertainable and thus the only formula which can be ascribed to a zeolite when its unit cell contents are unknown. since the only significant quantity in such a formula is the term 2y/x, and since this term (which is almost invariably a range) can usually be satisfied by many zeolites of widely differing lattice geometry, chemical formula is not uniquely restrictive in establishing the identity of a zeolite. furthermore, such a formula frequently expresses artefact when empirically derived, the cationic-valence/aluminum-atoms ratio deviating from unity, and it fails to provide for zeolites whose lattice structure can be brought into existence from reaction mixtures from which alumina is excluded. moreover, both the unit cell formula; and the "mole ratio of oxides" formula imply t-hat the geometrical identity which persists between succeedinf.unit cells is accompanied by their compositional identity. we have now discovered a zeolite having a lattice structure previously unknown, as evidenced by its x-ray diffraction data; which we call zsm-48. according to the present invention a crystalline zeolitic material; zsm-48; has a lattice constituted by si-04 and possibly alo4 tetrahedra crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms and characterized by the following interplanar spacings: table 1 d(a ) relative intensity 11.8 + 0.2 w-vs 10.2 + 0.2 w-m 7.2 + 0.15 w 4.2 t 0.08 vs 3.9 + 0.08 vs 3.6 + 0.06 w 3.1 + 0.05 w 2.85 # 0.05 w these values were determined by standard techniques. the radiation was the k-alpha doublet of copper, and a scintillation counter
