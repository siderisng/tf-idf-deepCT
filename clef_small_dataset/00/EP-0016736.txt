<ABSTRACT>
the columns (15) are sustained and guided by tractors or  other suitable means and terminally carrying the excavation  tools (21), such improvements including in combination and  coordination a support and positioning auxiliary platform  (16) which is at least partially mobile, a support plate (27)  which is at least partially rotating and sustained by said  auxiliary platform (16) and supporting the said telescopic  column; there being included means (18) for generating the  frontal oscillation of the auxiliary platform (16) and means  (32) for generating the partial rotation of the said support  plate (27).

<DESCRIPTION>
description of the invention entitled: "improvements in telescopic columns for making foun dations and columns for foundations thus improved" in the name of casagrande & u. s.p.a. of fontanafredda (pn) filed on under no the present invention relates to improvements in telescopic columns cor excavating trenches and foundations, as well telescopic columns for making tren chews and foundations adopting such improvements. the improvements relate to telescopic columns which serve to sustain, guide and drive buckets, d drills driils and other toois normally used in excavating - trenches, foundations and sim@lar. in the field of digging linear trenches, foundations and perforations by columns, telescopic colu mns are used which consent digging at a great depth by placing the support means on an easily accessable surface area. .it-is also known that the telescopic co-lumns are equi .ped with buchets, drills or similar means for the .purpose of executing the required excavation. it is also known, and the name itself hints at that, that the telescopic columns are advantageously formed of a plurality of columns insertable within each other and made to extend for use according to the depth of the job. there are also various types of known equipments whichare terminally provided on the columns and al so known are the driving and movementation system of these equipments. the present system is directed to the system of installing, anchorage and displacement of the co- columns. the present invention improves the manoeuvrabili- .ty of the telescopic columns expanding thus their .field of utility. .. it is a scope of the invention to permit a simpler and more precise drive control of the known means. it is also a scope of the present invention to consent complete manoeuvrability and autonomy. another scope of the present invention is the pos sibility of actuating mini telescopic columns for excavation work in tunnels or in uncomfortable work .sits having scarce useful overhead space. one further scope of the invention is to permit the digging and executing of inclined excavations @ one other scope is to permit the positioning of the telescopic columns in such a way as to execute excavations at an angle without difficulties nor com- plicabed auxiliary maneouvres of the support means. these scopes as well as other scopes and various advantages are achieved by the present invention. the invention is summed up by providing an auxi- liary platform, substantially horizontal but incl -nable at will at least inothe plane in front of the support means, which in turn sustains a telescopic column by means of plate which is advantageously at least partially rotating. these improvements permit the elimination of the traditional grider columns and also simplify the installation on the excavator tractor and lead to an improvement of the general and particular efficien cy. the inventionrelates to improvements in telescopic columns for foundations, columns which are sustained .and guided by a tractor or other suitable means and which carry terminally thereof the excavating and work means, characterised by the fact of including . in
