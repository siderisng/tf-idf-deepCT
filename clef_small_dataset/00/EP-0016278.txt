</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
title: acrylic polymer coated granular pesticidal compositions it is known that a number of phosphorus pesticidal compounds, such as 2-(diethoxyphosphinyl imino)-1, 3-dithiolane, 2-(diethoxyphosphinylimino)-4 methyl-1,3-dithiolane, 2-(diethoxyphosphinylimino)-1,3- dithietane, o,o-diethyl s-(ethylthiomethyl)phosphorodithioate and o,o-diethyl s-tt(l,l-dimethylethyl)thiogmethyl -phosphorodithioate, are highly effective for the control of broad spectrum of insects and/or nematodes which attack and destroy agriculturally important food and fodder crops. it is, therefore, of advantage to utilize such compounds in various compositions useful in agriculture. unfortunately, these otherwise highly effective pesticides are extremely toxic when introduced into the human circulatory system as by ingestion, inhalation, or dermal absorption. thus, the use of compositions containing the above referred-to compounds for the control of insect pests represents a distinct hazard to individuals engaged in the use and application thereof. similar hazards are encountered by those who are engaged in storing, transporting and distributing to the ultimate user such compositions. practical use aspects of the above referred 0 pesticide compounds for intended pest control often dictate the use of various granular carrier compositions in which the pesticidal compound is adsorbed or absorbed onto or into the carrier composition. these granular compositions not only provide a more dilute composition of twhe active pesticide for appropriate applications in agronomic uses but also serve to reduce the potential hazard in use of the pesticide through dermal absorption. even though such formulated compositions tend to reduce the potential hazard of dermal absorption of the above referred-to pesticides, it is highly desirable to reduce the potential hazard even more. it is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a granular formulation composition containing a phosphorus pesticide which exhibits reduced mammalian dermal toxicity, while retaining its presticidal effectiveness. to these ends, it has been found that, when solid granular compositions containing phosphorus pesticides are treated, as by spraying for instance, with certain acrylic latices, or with solutions of certain acrylic polymers in organic solvents, the resultant acrylic polymer coated compositions possess advantageously a two to three fold margin of safety due to their lowered mammalian dermal toxicity as compared to similar, uncoated compositions, while their pesticidal activity and physical integrity remains unchanged. these effects may be accomplished in a straightforward manner by applying certain acrylic latex compositions or solutions of certain polymers in an organic solvent to the surfaces of said impregnated pesticidal granules. more specifically, the invention in one aspect is a solid particulate composition comprising particles of an inert sorptive or non-sorptive carrier impregnated or coated with a phosphorus pesticide, and optionally cuat and blended with a finely divided sorptive substrate, characterized in that the carrier pesticide entity is coated with an acrylic polymer selected from the group consisting of a (1) hard, thermoplastic acrylic polymer having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.75 dl/g to 3.1 dl/g at 300c. in tetrahydrofuran, (2) hard, self-crosslinking thermoplastic acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 1.0 dl/g to 2.0 dl/g at 30or. in dimethylformamide and (3) acrylic polymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.05 dl/g to 0.1 dl/g at 30 c. in
