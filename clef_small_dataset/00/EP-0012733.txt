a storage plant (8) including vertically pileable load  carriers (3), which carry the goods to be stored, the load  carriers (3) being stacked in a plurality of vertical piles (4),  which are arranged close to each other.  moreover, the plant  includes pile beds (2) supporting the pile (4) of load carriers  (3) by means of support members (12) at a distance above  the floor (5) of the storage plant (8), and at least one carriage  (6) for insertion of the load carriers (3) in the piles (4) and for  removal of them therefrom.  each load carrier (3) is provided with stationary down­ wards extending rest members, which are adapted to co­ operate with complementary upwards extending support  members secured on each pile bed (2).  the rest members of  the lower load carrier (3) of the pile (4) are arranged to be  brought out of and into engagement with the support mem­ bers (12) of the pile bed (2) by menas of vertical movement  of the load carriers (3), which is performed by the carriage  (16).
