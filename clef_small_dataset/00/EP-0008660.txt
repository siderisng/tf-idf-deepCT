<ABSTRACT>
Holder for tripping devices with a movement element (1) which held contact-free in a relatively stable half teeposition from which it is triggered by expanding an outer force. The relatively stable holding position results by overlowing a potential field of magnetic cutting (9, 10, 11) with another potential field based on a mechanical bias of the motion element (1) or a magnet (12) such that the total potential run the holding position corresponding sink. By supplying an outer force, the motion element (1) is raised to a summit position of the total potential run, from which acceleration forces act on the movement element (1). The magnet (12) and the magnetic cutting (9, 10, 11) are formed in particular by magnets of rare earths, which z. b. For printers for pre-acceleration dip coil-driven pressure hammers can be used.
