<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus is provided for removing  contaminants or for receiving valuable minerals by ion  exchange treatment of a feed liquid, e. g.  waste water or  phosphoric acid.  the resin bed is a moving bed which is  circulated stepwise from the loading vessel (11) in which the  feed liquid is treated into a regeneration vessel (14).  to  obtain the advantages of a packed ion exchange resin bed  system, a loading reservoir (13) is provided in the resin path  between the regeneration vessel (14) and the loading vessel,  rinsing and purging of the resin bed taking place in the  reservoir (13).  also, a regeneration reservoir (15) is provided  in the resin path between the loading vessel (11) and the  regeneration vessel (14).  laminar flow of resin can be  achieved, and bulk movement of the whole resin bed  simultaneously can be avoided.
