<ABSTRACT>
process and apparatus for applying a flowable coating  medium to a travelling web by a reverse applicator roll technique  in which the peripheral velocity of the applicator roll  (u) is maintained at less than 0. 4 of the forward speed of the  web, and the dynamic viscosity of the coating medium (η) is  selected in accordance with the relationship h = kη0. 5u0. 5,  wherein k is from 0. 01 to 100, such that a layer of coating  medium of equilibrium thickness (h) not exceeding 5. 0 mm is  entrained on the surface of the applicator roll for transfer to  the web.  the technique avoids the use of a doctor blade to  meter the amount of coating medium on the applicator roll,  and is suitable for the high speed application of a heat sealable  coating layer onto a polymaric packaging film.  coating  quality can be improved by stabilising the web downstream  of the applicator roll.
