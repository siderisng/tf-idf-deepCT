<ABSTRACT>
herbicidally active thiocarbamates are employed in  combination with organophosphorothioates, the latter in suf­ ficient qualtity to prevent soil degradation of the former.  as a  result, the herbicidal effectiveness of the thiocarbamate is  significantly enhanced and prolonged, rendering a single  application of the herbicide effective over a longer period of  time.

<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention this invention relates to herbicidal compositions and methods of use. in particular, this invention relates to herbicidal compositions comprising an herbicidally active thiocarbamate in combination with an organophosphorus compound, the latter serving to prolong the effectiveness of a single application of the thiocarbamate herbicide in controlling undesired plant growth. thiocarbamates are well known in the agricultural art as herbicides useful for weed control in crops such as corn, potatoes, beans, beets, spinach, tobacco, tomatoes, alfalfa, and others. thiocarbamates are primarily used in pre-emergence application. they have been found to be particularly effective when incorporated into the soil prior to the planting of the crop. as a herbicide, the thiocarbamate is mrst concentrated immediately after its application. how long thereafter the initial concentration is retained depends in large part on the particular soil used. thus the rate at which the thiocarbamate herbicide concen traction declines following its application tends to vary from one type of soil to the next. this is evident both in the observable extent of actual weed control and in the detectable presence cf undegraded thiocarbamate remaining in the soil after con ,iderable time has elapsed. it has now been discovered that the soil persistence of certain herbicidally active thiocarbamates is significantly extended by the incorporation of certain organophosphorus compounds, which have no herbicidal activity of their own, into the herbicide formulation. this improvement in the soil persistence of the thiocarbamates manifests itself in a variety of ways. it can be shown, for example, that the rate of decrease of the thiocarbamate content of the soil is substantially lessened with the use of the organophosphorus compound. this is evidenced by soil analyses taken at regular intervals following application of the thiocarbamate herbicide. improved soil persistence is also shown by herbicidal efficacy tests, wherein the degree of weed injury is measured after a set period of time following application of the herbicide. in such a test, the organophosphorus compound, which has no herbicidal activity of its own, is shown to increase the herbicidal effectiveness of the thiocarbamate by increasing the persistence of the latter in the soil, and thus prolonging its effective life. other ways in which the effect manifests itself will be evident from the following description. brief description of the invention this invention relates to a novel herbicidal composition comprising (a) an herbicidally effective amount of a thiocarbamate having the formula emi2.1 in which r1 is c1-c alkyl, c -c alkenyl, c7-cg phenyl 1 6 . . 3 6 . . 7 9 . . alkyl, or phenyl, and is optionally substituted with one, two, or three halogen atoms, and rê and r are either selected independently from c1-c6 alkyl and c5-c7 cycloalkyl, or combined to conjointly form c4-c7 alkylene; and (b) an amount of an organophosphorus compound having the formula emi3.1 in which r4 is c1-c6 alkyl, c3-c6 alkenyl, c3-c6 alkynyl, or c5-c7 cycloalkyl, and is optionally substituted with one or more members selected from halo, cyano, c1-c3 alkoxy, and c1-c3 alkylthio,
