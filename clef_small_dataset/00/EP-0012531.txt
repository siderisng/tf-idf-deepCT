<ABSTRACT>
a tape tension arm arrangement for selectively dispo足 sing a pair of tension rollers (102) supported by respective  tension arms (101) in positions appropriate for tape loading  or tape drive.  each tension arm (101) is mounted on a  pivoted rocker member (107) which is coupled to a driving  crank member (104) by a connecting rod (105).  the con足 necting rod (105) engages the rocker member (107) in  such a manner that in the tape drive position the tension  arm (101) may move against a resilient bias (112) towards  the tape threading position, in response to an increase in  the tension of the tape.  a tape transport system is also de足 scribed which includes a tape tension arm arrengement of  the type described above and a reel mounting device for  supporting a reel having an internal support surface.  the  reel mounting device includes three resiliently coupled reel  mounting members each supported between symmetrically  disposed pivot points.  each member has a resilient peri足 pheral surface (9) capable of frictionally engaging the  internal support surface of the reel and a lever arm capable  of releasing the reel from such engagement.
