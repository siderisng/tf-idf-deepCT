<ABSTRACT>
a metal roller for preventing web-shaped material from being pushed together or for spreading it out, with single-thread or multiple- thread screw helices on the roller surface, consists essentially of a thin-walled tube (2), out of the surface of which the screw helices are shaped by cold working.  there can serve for the shaping a device which has two intermeshing passes (15, 17).  of these, one (15) is arranged as an inner pass on the inside of the tube (2) to be shaped and has an outside diameter smaller than the inside diameter of the tube, so that a free space (f) remains between the rear side of the inner pass facing away from the machining side and the inner wall of the tube.  the second pass (17) acts as an outer pass on the surface of the tube and is brought into engagement with the inner pass by means of an adjusting device (32, 33), with the tube casing (2) being shaped at the same time.  <image>
