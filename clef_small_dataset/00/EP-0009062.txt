<ABSTRACT>
a stereoscopic filmstrip (f) and associated viewer (20)  are described.  the filmstrip (f) is made from standard  35 mm film by a method which allows copies to be made  using standard film copy equipment.  image frames are ar­ ranged on the strip in two longitudinai rows (r₁,r₂) stereo­ scopically paired images (e.  g.  1l, 1r) being in one of the  longitudinal rows (r₁) and one of the images being spaced  along the row, in relation to its paired image, by four inter­ vening frames (e.  g.  23r, 2l, 24r, 3l).  the viewer illuminates the filmstrip by reflection of in­ cident light by mirror (120); a mask (94) in front of the  filmstrip has apertures (96) to allow viewing of paired ste­ reoscopic images (e.  g.  1l, 1r) only.  a filmstrip transport  mechanism (30) in the viewer is a ratchet-driven wheel  turnable stepwise by an amount corresponding to the spac­ ing on the filmstrip (f) between a first pair of images (1l,  1r) and a successive pair of images (2l, 2r).
