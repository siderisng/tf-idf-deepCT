<ABSTRACT>
in a dynamic random access memory including means  for inputting a row strobe signal and means for inputting a  column strobe signal, and having the functions of incorporatÂ­ ing a row address input in response to the row strobe signal  and incorporating a column address input in response to the  column strobe signal; the improvement comprises a first  insulated gate field effect transistor having drain coupled to a  first junction point, gate receiving the column strobe signal  and source supplied with a first power supply, means for  charging the first junction point within a period of active level  of the row strobe signal, a second insulated gate field effect  transistor having a drain coupled to the first junction point,  gate coupled to a second junction point and source supplied  with the first power supply terminal, means for precharghing  the second junction point within a period of absence of the  row strobe signal, and a third insulated gate field effect  transistor having drain coupled to the second junction point,  the gate supplied with the column strobe signal and source  supplied with the first power supply.  after completion of a  desired operation with respect to a selected memory cell, the  row strobe signal is made at its inactive level to be reset  while the column strobe signal is at its active level.  then,  after a necessary reset period when the row strobe signal is  made active a change from inactive level to active level of the  first junction point is suppressed thereby to inhibit active  operation based on the column strobe signal.
