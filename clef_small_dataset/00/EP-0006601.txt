<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing fiber-reinforced cellulose hydroche hook sheaths, in which one impregnates a fibrous hose continuously with viscose solution and coated, the surface of the longitudinal axially straightforward from top to bottom continuously continuous fiber hose continuously circulated circularly along the tube circumference with precipitating liquid, it at the end of the tube leads, then treated with washing liquid as well as chemical plasticizing liquid and dried it; Furthermore, it relates to a device consisting of a circle ring nozzle body (1) with annular slit gap (2) for the continuously impregnation and coating of the fiber tube with viscose solution and at least one device arranged below the circular ring nozzle body (1) for engagement of the viscosed fiber tube on the circumferential a circular line with precipitating fluid, which consists of a circular element in cross-section, which for acting on the outside of the viscosed fiber tube as a hollow cylindrical shell (8) with circular slot gap (9) in the jacket wall mouth (9a) of the circle ring slot gap on the jacket wall inner side and to be Antitude of the inside of the viscous fiber tube with precipitating liquid as a cylinder (15) with the circular ring slit gap (15a) to bear.
