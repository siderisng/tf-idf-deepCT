<ABSTRACT>
a panel for walls of electric furnaces comprising a series  of elements (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15) provided with holes (2a, 5a, 6a) in  which suitable tubes (16,3t,4t) for water circulation are  inserted or incorporated.  the surface of the panel looking the melted material is  preferably shaped with cavities (2a, 2b) so as to hold refracÂ­ tory material.  more refractory bricks (7) may be comprised  within adjacent elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
paolo fontanini adriano meroi i- 33100 udine "cooled panels for walls of electric furnaces" this invention relates to panels cooled by water or other suitable liquid for forming the walls of electric furnaces, wherein, as well knovin, smelting takes place by electric discharges. an ideal panel, which may be part of a wall or may form the whole wall of an electric furnace should fulfill the following requirements: (1) provide minimal heat losses through the panel. (2) provide the greatest possible safety against any accidental exit of water or other fluid. (3) be of a big enough size, so that only a reduced number of outside connections has to be carried out for the supply and discharge of water or other fluids. (4) be of a suitable size and having thermal characteristics according to each site or zone of each furnace. (5) enable a long life of the panel in use. (6) allow the partial replacement of zones of the panel according to requirements and as desired. different types of panel are commercially available, but the solutions hitherto proposed only partly meet these conditions. particularly, boxes or sectors are used as panels for electric furnaces having water circulating therein, but this fluid, though it has fixed paths, may, due to the provision of not circular sections, easily build up pockets of steam or dead water causing overheating of some zones of the boxes and accordingly a perforation thereof. also steel blocks are used as having a built-in inner coil. the water path is fixed therein, thus assuring a smooth flow, but the disadvantage arises that the panel smelting involves a complicated operation, the reduced size of the panel causing the increase of outside connections. a further disadvantage is that during use the considerable size of the anel causes cracks on the melted inner wall thereof. in this case, it is also required to provide panels for each specific requirement. thus, different panels should be provided for each type of furnace and in a same furnace panels which are different as to characteristics and size according to the different use zones or sites. it is the object of the present invention to provide as improved cooled panel for electric furnaces, by which a lower maintenance cost can be obtained having at the same time the possibility of providing in the least possible time panels having suitable characteristics according to the specific use intended therefor. it is another object of the present invention to provide a lower consumption of electric energy due to absorption of calories from water or other fluid in the panel. it is another object of the invention to allow for replacing only part of the panel in case of servicing or maintenance. it is a further object of the present invention to enable mutual displacements between tubes and body of the panel, such as to take up the differential thermal expansions created by the big cnanges in temperature. the main object has been accomplished by providing to form
