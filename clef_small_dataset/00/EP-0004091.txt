<ABSTRACT>
a novel cracking catalyst, a method of preparing same  and an improved hydrocarbon cracking process are provided  wherein adverse effects of metals such as nickel, vanadium  and iron in the cracking catalyst are precluded or mitigated  by contacting the cracking catalyst with at least one treating  agent selected from the group consisting of elemental tellurium,  oxides of tellurium and compounds convertible to  elemental tellurium or oxide thereof during cracking or  catalyst regeneration, whereby to said cracking catalyst is  added a modifying amount of said treating agent.
