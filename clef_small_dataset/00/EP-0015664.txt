<ABSTRACT>
a slag treatment process which comprises introducÂ­ ing molten slag into a slagging pit adding a finely divided  material capable of producing reducing conditions within  the sagging pit said finely divided material being added in  the form of an aqueous slurry and thereafter allowing the  reactions so initiated to proceed to completion.

<DESCRIPTION>
description the present invention relates to a treatment of metallurgical slags, and has particular reference to treatment of steelworks liquid slag to obtain better physical and chemical properties with a view to recycling them in sinter and blast furnace plants or utilizing them for other purposes with less subsequent processing. in modern integrated iron and steel works, steelmaking slags are transported in liquid form in slag ladles to specially constructed pits outside the steel plant, where they are tipped and cooled by water sprays. after solidification, they are excavated and then passed through slag handling plants where the metallic materials are removed using a series of magnetic separators and screens. further processing is carried out by passing the slags through various types of crushers and screens. as processed steel slags are still high in iron, lime and manganese, the o to 8 mm grain size of steelworks slags is recycled in the blast furnaces via the sinterplant and partially replaces more expensive fluxes. in bos steelmaking the percentage of slag that can be recycled in this manner depends on the maximum phosphorous content permissable in the hot metal. most steelpants demand a phosphorous content not exceeding 0.20/0. the remaining slag material of larger sizes are available for various other uses, particularly in highway construction. in an integrated iron and steel works the dust laden gases from the blast furnaces and bos furnaces are frequently cleaned in the last instance by water sprays, in order to remove the fine particles and thus enable the further utilization of the gases. the waters carrying the fine particles or slurry are conducted to settling basins. in due course the fine particles coagulate into thickened solids or a black mud-like substance very high in water content. these ponds have to be emptied from time to time to continue their usage. at the present time, these products can only be used in sinterplant mixes, if they are previously treated in a drying plant. the fineness of the product, however, greatly reduces the productivity of the sinterplant, and furthermore, the drying plant should include a roasting operation by the addition of carbon in order to pass the undesirable volatile alkali and zinc element into the gaseous phase. such plant requires a considerable capital investment and consumes considerable amount of energy. according to the present invention, there is provided a slag treatment process which comprises introducing molten slag and a finely divided material capable of producing reducing conditions into a slagging pit, said finely divided material being added in the form of an aqueous slurry and thereafter allowing the reactions so initiated to proceed to completion. the finely divided material may include carbon which may be included with the finely divided material or added separately. by finely divided material is to be understood a material of average grain size of 0.2 mm or less. in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the composition is a steelworks mud obtained in the manner described above. typical blast furnace gas
