<DESCRIPTION>
polymer bound phase transfer catalyst and process for its s preparation this invention deals ith an improved process for converting 3-thenylbromide to 3-thienylacetonitrile by reaction of the first of these compounds with an alkali metal cyanide and in the presence of triphase reaction catalysts. further, new catalyst compositions are provided. a significant and recurring problem in organic synthesis stems from the use, or desired use, of a watersoluble reagent in chemically altering a water-insoluble organic substrate. if the reaction is conducted as a heterogeneous process (e.g., organic phase-aqueous phase reaction) observed reaction rates are normally very slow owing to the low concentration of at least one of the reac-tants in each phase. techniques currently available to circumvent this problem rely on the use of rapid stirring, cosolvent, and phase-transfer methods. if chemical reaction takes place at a liquid-liquid phase-boundary, rapid stirring may have an accelerating effect by increasing interfacial contact. alternatively, the addition of a cosolvent can bring about a homogeneous state and thereby completely eliminate phase separation. although this latter approach is often useful, product mixtures are necessarily made more complex and the resulting workup made more difficult. in addition, with aqueous phase-organic phase reactions, use of a cosolvent not only renders the organic substrate accessible to the reagent, but also increases the substrate's contact with water and can promote competing hydrolytic pathways. recently, a third technique has been developed which appears to have considerable potential; this method has been referred to as phasetransfer catalysis. in brief, an organic-soluble, partial 1 water-soluble catalyst (most commonly a tetraalkyl arrf,onium or tetraalkylphosphonium salt) accelerates an aqueous phase-organic phase reaction, presumably, by extracting a given ionic reagent out of water and into the bulk organic phase where reaction can ensue. based on entranced reaction rates, high yields of products, and the convenience found with this method, it seems likely that zany industrial applications will be forthcoming. one practical limitation to the phase-transfer method, however, is that many of the catalysts used promote the formation of stable emulsions. more recently, a new type of heterogeneous catalysis termed '!triphase catalysis" has been introduced. the under lying feature which distinguishes this from other forms of heterogeneous catalysis is that the catalyst and each one of a pair of reactants are located in separate phases. this principle has been successfully applied to certain aqueous phase-organic phase reactions employing a slid phase catalyst. s. l. regen, j. an. chem. soc., 97, 5956 (1975). the present invention relates to a novel catalyst for use in such reactions. previously, such triphase catalysts have been used to catalyze aqueous phase-organic phase reactions in which homogeneous phase transfer catalysts have produced stable emulsions, greatly reducing the usefulness of homogeneous phase transfer catalysts. triphase catalysts have been used in cyanide displacement. halogen exchange, dichlorocarbene addition, dichlorocarbene chlorination, alkoxide and phenoxide displacement, dehalogenation of vic-dibrorides and oxidation of alcohols. s. l. regen. j. org. chem. soc., viol. 42, no. 5, 1977. in general, the triphase catalst employ chloromethylated polystrene beads, subsequently reacted with
