<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for treating soil by injecting grout into the soil  at different levels sequentially, the apparatus comprising a  pipe (10) having pistons (19, 20, 21, 22) slidable therein, the  pistons being apertured and means extending through the  apertures of the pistons longitudinally of the pipe and being  movable longitudinally of the pipe to close the apertures of  the piston in sequence thus allowing each piston to be  moved downwardly by the hydraulic pressure of the grout  thus to open apertures (11, 12, 13, 14) in the pipe in sequence  and allow grouting at the different levels in sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
grouting this invention relates to apparatus for treating soils by injecting grout into the soil. the grout solidified and thus stabilizes or consolidates the soil. the grout may, for example, comprise a mixture of sodium silicate solution with a hardener such as ethyl acetate. the ethyl acetate hardens the grout after it has been injected into the soil but the time of solidification can be controlled so that the grout is liquid at the time of injection. it is necessary in practice in many cases to inject grout into a soil mass sequentially at different levels starting at the lowermost level in the soil to be stabilized. thus a hole is bored in the soil and an injection pipe is lowered into the hole, the pipe having a series of circumferentially spaced apertures, the series being spaced apart along the length of the pipe. each series of apertures is closed by a flexible collar, the collar surrounding the pipe in alignment with the series of apertures. the usual way of controlling the injection is by the provision of what is known as a double packer in the pipe. this packer comprises two interconnected pistons which can be moved along the pipe so that the space between the pistons is aligned with a series of apertures in the pipe. grout under pressure is then supplied to the space between the pistons which prevent the grout flowing up or down the pipe so the grout deforms the collar which closes the apertures, flows out of the apertures, cracks the bentonite cement which fills the space between the bore hole and the pipe and flows into the soil. the collars form one-way valves and prevent the ingress of soil into the pipe. the double packer is then moved up until it is aligned with the next series of apertures and the operation repeats itself and so on until the required levels of soil have been stabilized. this apparatus which is in use has a number of dis the s=anç ab¯s she first is that it normally requires two orlrostorf to move the double packer from one position to another within the pipe. this means that two operators can use tally only operate about three injection pipes simult aneously. there are other disadvantages as well which are as fllows: - 1. when the pipe is lowered into the bore hole the collars shift thus allowing soil to enter the pipe and prevent proper seating of the packer so that clearing becomes necessary. when the grout is thus supplied to the space between the pistons it can return up in the pipe instead of flowing into the soil and it can solidify in the pipe and cause problems. 2. the pipe can deform in service and this can cause difficulties in moving the packer. 3. sometimes, even without the ingress of soil, the packer will leak so that one will get solidified grout above and/or below the packer. 4. in practice it is difficult accurately

claims    1. apparatus for treating soil by injection comprising a pipe having apertures spaced apart along the length of the pipe, a plurality of pistons slidable within the pipe in sealing relation thereto, each piston having an aperture therein which places the parts of the pipe above and below the piston in mutual communication, means for introducing grout into the pipe above the uppermost piston therein, limit means between adjacent apertures to limit movement of each piston between adjacent limit means along the pipe, and means extending longitudinally of the pipe and passing through the central apertures of the pistons and which can be moved along the pipe to effect closing of the apertures in the pistons in sequence thus to allow the hydraulic pressure of the grout to move each piston downwardly against the limit means.    2. apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said longitudinally extending means is arranged to inject material to solidify grout in a piston aperture thus to close said aperture.     3. apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said aperture is conical and converges downwardly.    4. apparatus according to claim 1 wherein sad longitudinally extending means comprises a pipe having an inflatable member at its lower end, the inflatable member being capable of being positioned in an aperture in a piston and inflated to close said aperture.    5. apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said longitudinally extending member comprises a rod or cable and a ball is arranged above each piston and dimensioned to close the aperture therein, the ball being retained out of the aperture by the rod or cable but allowed to fall into the aperture to seal it as the rod or cable is moved out of the aperture in the piston.
