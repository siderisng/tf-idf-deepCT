<ABSTRACT>
an outerwear coat or jacket is provided with a removable  liner whereby the liner has fastener means spaced from  the edges of the liner adapted to engage mating fastener  means on the edges of the outer shell so as to leave marginal  panels projecting from the front edge of the outer shell to  effectively increase the overall girth of the outerwear when  the liner is fitted to the outer shell such that the internal girth  is the same when the outer shell is worn with the liner as  when the outer shell is worn independently.
