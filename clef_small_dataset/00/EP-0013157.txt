<ABSTRACT>
a permanent magnet rotor (10) comprises a hub (12), to  the periphery of which are attached, as by brazing, a number  of wedge-shaped magnet support members (14).  between  each adjacent pair of support members (14), there are  mounted one or more permanent magnets (22), which are  also wedge-shaped, with an angle of taper of, typically, 12 to  16 degrees.  when rotating, the rotor is subjected to centrifugal  forces which wedge the magnets (22) more firmly into  the spaces between the support members (14), so that the  magnets cannot escape, and will not be subjected to tensile  stresses.

<DESCRIPTION>
"permanent magnet rotors, especially for dynamo-electric machines" this invention relates to permanent magnet rotors, especially for dynamo-electric machines, such as alternators, synchronous a,c. motors, and also for magnetic couplings. the prior art u.s patent no. 3,083,311 discloses an arrangement in which a permanent magnet rotor is used in an alternator. this rotor has a hub of a ferromagnetic material, around which are arranged a plurality of permanent magnets. each of these magnets is somewhat wedge-shaped, with the narrower end of the wedge pointing radially outwards. the magnets are held in place by being embedded in a ring of aluminium which is @est in situ around the magnets and the hub. thus, sen each adjacent pair of magnets, there is a wedgeshapes kart of the aluminium ring, and these wedgeshaped parts hold the magnets in place against centrifugal forces by their integral connection to the parts of the aluminium ring which lie axially beyond the ends of the magnets, and which in effect form two aluminium -d rings. although the aluminium is in contact with the material of the hub, there will be little bond strength asisting the end rings in resisting centri fugal force. such a structure is not suited to @@@ @rly @ od operation; in the specific exemple quoten in this prior u. s. patent, the rotor runs at 3600 r. p. m. other rotor structures employing permanent magnets are disclosed in u. s. patent no. 3,072,813 and german ratent application no. 2,659,650. the german patent application discloses the use of ferrite magnets, which are often brittle and weak in tensile strength. then brittle magnets are used on a rotor, it has been conventional to surround them by a reinforcing hoop, which receives the centrifugal forces exerted on the magnets, so that the magnets are stressed in compression rather than in tension. in any structure which employs a ring or hoop to resist centrifugal forces, the radial thickness of the ring has to be increased as the design speed of the rotor is increased; as the speed increases, more and ore of the strength of the ring is used to withstand the bursting centrifugal forces exerted on the mass of the ring itself, and less and less strength is available to restrain the magnets against centrifugal forces. also, where the ring or hoop actually surrounds the magnets, there may be some difficulties in distributing tb centrifugal forces evenly over the contact area between magnet and hoop. uneven distribution of these forces both stresses the hoop in bending, and may also result in cracking of the magnets. the use of a radially thick ring surrounding the magnets also results in increased reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and irerezsed flux leakage. su @@arv of the invention a@cording to one aspect of the present invention, a permanent magnet rotor, which comprises a hub, a plurality of wedge-shape support members mounted around the perlphery of the hub, with their narrower ends adjacent the periphery of the hub, each of the spaces between
