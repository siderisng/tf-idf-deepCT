<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a waistening device for wastewater with in a trough rotating, drum-like rotor, which is divided by axially parallel partition walls into a plurality of outside open, radial chambers and whose partitions are provided with outwardly facing outward portions with the dipping position, so that in the trailing part of the chambersAir volume is taken into the liquid.This air volume would suddenly relate to the bottom dead center and almost completely from the trough, which would lead to insufficient ventilation and high drive performance.According to the invention, the partitions (10-15) additionally have a portion (36-41) facing at the detour position.As a result, a part of the air volume (55) remains caught in the occurrence movement in the reliance part of the chambers (16-20).In the airlava gerung within the chambers can be achieved by baffles (42-47) an even better degree of ventilation.
