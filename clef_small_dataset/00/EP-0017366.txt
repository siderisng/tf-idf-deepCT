<ABSTRACT>
a cylinder lock includes two barrels (23, 37), a first (23)  carrying tumblers (30) that abut internal shoulders (36) of the  lock casing (2) to obstruct clockwise 'unlocking' rotation  only, and the second (37) carrying a single tumbler (43)  which obstructs only counter-clockwise 'locking' rotation by  abutment with a shoulder (48) of a rear-end casing-over (8).   a key (5) inserted through a keyhole-defining assembly (11,  16, 21) withdraws the first-barrel tumblers (30) during initial  clockwise turning from the insertion position, and the  second-barrel tumbler (43) during initial counter-clockwise  turning.  lost-motion coupling between the barrels (23, 37),  provided by lug-in- (38, 39) interengagement, enables clock­ wise turning of the second barrel (23) during withdrawal of  the first-barrel tumblers (30), and corresponding counter-­ clockwse turning of the first barrel (23) relative to the second  (37) during withdrawal of the second-barrel tumbler (43).   lug-in-slot coupling (22; 24) between the keyhole-defining  assembly (11, 16, 21) and the first barrel (23) similarly allows  initial slip for clockwise key-turning.  a coiled spring (42)  opposed resiliently second-barrel turning in both directions.
