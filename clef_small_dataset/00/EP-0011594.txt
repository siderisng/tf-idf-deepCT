<ABSTRACT>
The memory (80) is intended to be read or modified by an electronic logic system of a pocket calculator. It comprises a plurality of bistable electro-mechanical flip flops (82). Each rocker (82) comprises a locking input 1 (s) and a zero (R) input and an output (78). The inputs are individually connected to a multiplexer (702) controlled by a control circuit (701). The control circuit (701) is connected two directions with a central procoves via a bus (51). The control circuit (701) manages readings and inscriptions in the memory (80). The memory is intended to memorize data to be kept in the calculator safely and com mode, even if the power is cut off. The calculator is for example intended to perform calculations concerning the application of the OGINO method, the data to be memorized being the times of the previous cycles and the date of the last period.
