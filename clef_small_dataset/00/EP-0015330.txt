<ABSTRACT>
a power demand limiting circuit is disclosed com­ prising air temperature control apparatus coupled with a  municipal source of electric current through a thermo-re­ ponsive switch, through a meter having means for measu­ ring maximum power demand for any period in a succe­ sion of periods of preselected duration, and through a ti­ mer programmed to cycle a timer switch at least once du­ ring each of the periods, whereby the air temperature con­ trol apparatus is rendered incapable of demanding power  continuously throughout any of the metered periods.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus and method for controlling electrical power demand the invention relates to apparatus and a method for controlling connection of an electrical power consumer1 5 circuit to a power supply source so that metered charging for power supply, based not only on consumption but on available peak demand periods irrespective of actual consumption, can be limited. consumers of electrical power today are often charged by electrical utilities for both total power consumption during a billing period as well as for peak demand. this charge for peak demand is made irrespective of actual consumption made by the consumer during any specific period. the justification for this charge rests in the necessity of the utility having to have the resources available to provide power. during peak demand periods. in other words, it compensates the utility company for having to have the capacity available to service their customers during brief peak demand periods which capacity may remain idle during the remaining periods of each day and month. though billing periods of power companies normally cover a substantially long period of time such as a month, peak demand is calculated on a relatively short period of time such as quarter or half hour basis. accordingly, utility companies. meter both the total power supplied to their customers during each billing period as well as the maximum power delivered during any brief period in a succession of periods that cumulatively form the billing period. the maximum demand recorded during any of these brief periods in any one month is then imputed into a billing formula, exemplary of which is: emi2.1 <tb> <sep> f2 <sep> kw <sep> = <sep> ii-t14 <sep> rate <sep> | <sep> + <sep> t[na <sep> j <sep> maxt2 <sep> demand <tb> billing <sep> charge <sep> = <sep> 1 <sep> charge <sep> charge <tb> where t2 is the aforementioned relative brief period of time such as a quarter hour or half hour and t1 is the relative long billing period such as a month. typically, the electrical load that imposes the greatest demand for electricity for the majority of utility company customers is their temperature control systems, be it an air conditioning or electrical heating unit. thus, on hot summer days, air conditioners usually account for peak demand of customers whereas in winter their heaters account for peak demand. these temperature control units are themselves ordinarily controlled by thermostats which cyclically couple the system with. line voltage dependent upon sensed temperatures at which they are set to respond. their control function therefore is eventually divorced from the just described method or formula by which their consumption cost is calculated. accordingly, it is the general object of the present invention to provide means for limiting peak power demand. more specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electrical circuit for limiting peak power demand of air temperature control systems such as air conditioning and electrical heating systems. another object of the invention is to provide a power demand limiting circuit of

claims:   1. a consumer's electrical circuit having an electrical load coupled with a source of electric current through meter means for metering power consumption during a time period of relatively long duration and for metering maximum power demand during any time period in a succession of periods of relatively short duration occurring during the time period of relatively long duration, characterised thereby that means are provided for allowing the consumer to control his billing rate insofar as determined by maximum power demand during said periods of short duration, comprising programmable timer means for interrupting the coupling of the electrical load with the source of electric current for a selected time at least once during each of said demand periods of relatively short duration.   2. a power demand limiting circuit for allowing a consumer to control his billing rate by limiting peak power demand by an air temperature control system comprising, in combination, means for connection to a source of electric current; means for metering maximum power demand during any single demand period in a succession of demand periods of the same preselected duration and which cumulatively constitute a billing period, said metering means coupling said source of electric current with said air temperature control system;  and circuit means for coupling said air temperature control system with said source of electric current serially through a pair of switches with one switch means being a thermostat responsive to the temperature of  air controlled by said air temperature control system and with the other switch means being a timer programmed to cycle on and off at least once during each period in said succession of demand periods whereby a consumer may control his billing rate by allowing said control system to consume power for a portion only of-each period.   3. a power demand limiting circuit in accordance with claim 2 characterised thereby that said metering means further includes means for measuring total power consumption during said succession of periods.   4. a power demand limiting circuit in accordance with claim 2, said air temperature control system comprising an air conditioner compressor, characterised thereby that said air temperature control system further comprises an electrical resistance heating element, and said power demand limiting circuit further comprises selector switch means for coupling said air conditioner compressor and said electrical resistance heating element alternatively with said municipal source of electric current.   5. a power demand limiting circuit for allowing a consumer to control his billing rate by limiting peak power demand for an electrical system coupled with a municipal power supply and including means for metering maximum power demand during any demand period in a succession of demand periods of preselected duration which cumulatively form a billing period characterised thereby that means are provided for cycling said system on and off for a selected period of time  at least once during each demand period in said succession of demand periods.   6. a peak power demand limiting circuit for limiting power demand from an electrical system coupled with a municipal power supply which includes means for measuring power consumption over a complete billing period and means for measuring power consumed during each of a succession of equal, brief time periods which cumulatively form the billing period, said electrical system including demand switch means which may demand power throughout the entirety of any and each given one of said brief time periods whereby the electrical system could consume a maximum amount of power during each said given one of the brief time periods,  characterised thereby that timer means are provided for preventing power consumption by said electrical system for a significant fraction of each said given one of the brief time periods whereby the amount of power which may be consumed by the electrical system during each said given one of the brief time periods is significantly less than said maximum amount.   7. in an electrical distribution system servicing a plurality of customers and including first metering means for determining the total electrical power consumption of each customer over a billing period such as a month and second metering means for determining the power consumed by each customer over each of a plurality of successive time periods such as a half hour which cumulatively
