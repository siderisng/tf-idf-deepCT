<ABSTRACT>
a photographic camera for providing a plurality of  film images in order to produce a stereogram.  the camera  has a plurality of objectives which are independently adjustable  so that the optical axes of the lenses can be made  substantially parallel in a first plane.  the objectives have  substantially the same focal length and common shutter,  aperture and focal control.  the camera may include a film  magazine having a film advance equal to the number of  objectives.  placed between the lenses and the film is a  film plate (67) having a plurality of spaced image transmitting  openings (68-73) having their centers lying in a  first plane, the openings being symmetrically disposed  about a second plane orthogonal to the first plane.  the  widths of the openings (68-73) measured in the first plane  increase with the distance of the opening from the second  plane.
