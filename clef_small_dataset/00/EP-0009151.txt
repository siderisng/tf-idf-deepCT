<ABSTRACT>
it is provided for an insulating body (101) to be constructed in the form of a trough for a protective multiple outlet using bus bars and its mounting in a channel cover.  two contact bar pairs (5; 6) and an earth bar (7) are arranged on its base plate (134), which is fitted with support profiles.  an essentially flat cover plate (70) rests on the upper end edges (197) of the raised channel side walls (35) - if required with a channel cover (66) between them - on which cover plate (70) plug containers (56) are integrally formed, dipping between the side walls (35).  by this means, the problem is solved of creating a protective multiple outlet using bus bars, which can be produced cost-effectively and which can be installed easily, mechanically and electrically, for whose construction no traditional wiring complexity is required and which can be installed even in confined installation channels and without any requirement for the separate earthing of metallic channel covers (66).  <image>
