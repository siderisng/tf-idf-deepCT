<ABSTRACT>
The means include vertical crutches that can down or mount in wells practiced in the load to move. Each crutch has a pad that can slide on an associated sole, by means of cylinders. For the displacement, we go down the crutches, which raises the load, then we drag the skates on their soles, which moves the whole, then we go back the crutches to rest the load and, finally, we move, in the Other meaning, the soles with respect to the skates. The crutches (2) are removable and have, at the top, locking means (14) for locking them in a groove (26) of each well (1). The locking means (14) are automatically latched when putting on a crutch (2) in a well (1) and that they reach the throat. We can unlock them to remove each crutch (2) from its well (1) open to both ends. Each pad (3) is removable. The connection between a pad (3) and a crutch (2) is provided by a key (62). Between the pad (3) and its sole (4) is injected with pressurized water. These means can be used to achieve pontoons of amphibious factories. The removable crutches are not immobilized unnecessarily during pontoon parking.
