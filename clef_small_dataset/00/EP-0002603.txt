<ABSTRACT>
a yacht foresail or mainsail support and change-over  device is disclosed.  ready sail substitution is good seamanship, particularly  if carried out while maintaining at least one of the sails raised  at all times, to thereby maintain boat speed.  associated with  this desirable capability is the convenient storage of several  sails in readiness for raising and the ready storage of a  lowered sail.  the support (3) comprises at least two tracks (9)  on which sails (43) slides (10) are slidingly captivated.  the  support (3) is mounted against longitudinal movement, by  bush (15) with the lower end thereof upwardly of the lower  end of the supporting fixture, stay (36).  a said slide storage  magazine (18) is detachably mounted to the lower end of the  support (3).  the magazine (18) incorporates a track(s) (9a)  complementary to and aligned with the tracks (9) of the  support (3).  thus, a sail (43) can be pre-loaded in the  magazine (18) and, with mounting to the support (3) as  aforesaid, raised.  at the same time, conventionally immediately  thereafter, a previously raised sail can be lowered into  the empty magazine (18) in readiness for re-raising or  storage therewith.
