<ABSTRACT>
A film cassette for a light-sensitive film strip suitable for receiving multiple images is formed as a flat che, light-friendly bag, which has at least one perpendicular to the pocket length opening for passing the filmstrip. The bag may be bending SAM and inserted into its use suitable photogra fish camera straight or in a bow. The filmstrip can be pulled out of the pocket for exposure in the camera and transported back to it or moved past a pocket-side exposure window from a pocket half to the other. Such film cassettes have the advantage that they can be easily carried by the user as a flat cassette stack in greater number. Corresponding cameras have suitable cassette spaces and means for transported the film and possibly for opening and closing the pockets in the camera for recording and guiding such pockets. When such a pocket is inserted in one or more bends in an associated camera, spacer can be seen in the pocket inside for obtaining a free interior when pulling out and pushing back the filmstrip. A manufacturing and packaging procedure for a carcent cassette can be best hen in the wrapping of the spacer with light-tight material and previous or subsequent introduction of a filmstrip.
