<ABSTRACT>
in a ccd scanning arrangement, first and second ccd  arrays (10, 11) are used to look at spaced apart reading lines,  the sensor elements of the two arrays being staggered lon­ gitudinally relative to one another by half a pitch of the sensor  elements.  first and second stylus arrays (14, 15) spaced apart  by the same distance as the reading lines are connected  respectively (via appropriate eiectronics) to the sensor ele­ ments of the first and second ccd arrays (10, 11).  thus, in use,  as the first and second reading lines in turn scan a document  (2), the first and second stylus arrays (14, 15) create a copy.   the second line fills in the gaps between the styli of the first  writing line, thereby doubling the lines per cm across the  copy.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for reproducing graphic information this invention relates to an apparatus for reproduc ag graphic information, and is particularly concerned with an apparatus comprising optical means for forming in an image plane an image of a line of an original, scanning means for causing relative scanning motion between the original and the image plane in a direction transversely of the line, a linear array of photosensitive elements in the image plane arranged to receive the succession of line images, and marking means comprising a linear array of marking elements for marking a copy material in response to the outputs of the photosenstive elements. the marking elements are typically an array of electrographic styli, and may generate a reproduction of the original either in the same location as the original, or at a remote location after transmission of the electrical signals by facsimile transmission techniques. in an apparatus of this kind, an original, usually a document, is scanned by focussing an image of a line of the original information onto an array of photosensitive detectors, and either moving the document past a fixed optical system, or moving elements in the optical system, so that the detector array 'sees' a flowing succession of linear portions of the original document, the linear portions extending transversely of the scanning direction. the electrical outputs of the individual detectors may in the simplest case be individually amplified and passed directly to corresponding individual marking styli, eg, electrographic styli. alternatively, the electrical output signals of the detectors may be arranged in serial fashion for transmission to a remote location. the set of styli, whether in the same location as the detectors, or at a remote location, are arranged to form an electrostatic image on a copying material. the electrostatic image thus formed may then be developed, for example, by the same techniques as those used in xerography, to produce a visible copy of the original. the number of styli used in such arrangements to produce reasonable resolution is typically at least 80 per cm. thus, a 22 cm page width requires at least 1700 styli, for which a matrix addressing arrangement may be used to reduce the number of drivers required. in order to increase resolution in the copy, it is of course possible to increase the number of marking elements (eg styli) so that there are more of them per cm. the difficulties of manufacturing an electrographic array with such small styli has led to the use of two arrays of styli that are spaced apart in the scanning direction and in which the individual styli of the two arrays are staggered with respect to one another. such systems suffer from the disadvantage that an incoming succession of electrical signals needs to be treated in such a way that they energise appropriate ones of the styli. various electronic means have been proposed for this purpose. another problem which arises is that of obtaining sufficient resolution of the image at the array of photosensitive detectors. typically, arrays
