<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an antistatic film having a polypropylene  substrate and a polymeric heat-sealable surface  layer on which is present an antistatic composition comprising  (a) a quaternary ammonium compound, such as choline  chloride, (b) an organic polyol containing at least two free  hydroxyl groups, such as glycerol, (c) a glyceride of a long  chain fatty acid, such as glyceryl monostearate, and, optionally,  (d) an ethoxylated amine salt, such as an ethoxylated  tallow amine sulphate.  the composition is conveniently applied directly to the  surface of a polymeric extrudate which is subsequently  drawn to yield an oriented film, but at least the glyceride may  be preblended into the film-forming polymer.  the invention facilitates the production of uniformly  antistatic packaging films despite variations in ambient relative  humidity.
