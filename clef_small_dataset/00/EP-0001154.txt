<ABSTRACT>
a vibration detector incorporating two or more seismic  elements.  shock and vibration responsive switches commonly  employ a seismic element mounted on two parallel rods for  indicating a break in an electrical circuit connected to the rods.   these switches occasionally operate because foreign matter  lodges between the element and one of the rods.  these false alarms can be avoided by mounting two or  more seismic elements (25) on rods (18) which are bent so as  to provide concave surfaces (24) which support the elements  (25) so that they remain in contact with each other, thus  providing additional conductive paths between the rods (18).  although all of the elements (25) would simultaneously  lift off at least one of the rods (18) when subjected to shock or  vibration, it is unlikely that this condition would result from  foreign matter.  where the elements (25) are ferro-magnetic, they can be  mounted on straight rods (19) and urged together by a  magnetic field.
