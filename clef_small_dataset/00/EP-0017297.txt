<ABSTRACT>
a cryogenic separation of a feed gas mixture comprising  hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane is obtained by  partial condensation.  the feed gas (111) is partially cooled  and condensed, then separated to form first gas and liquid  fractions, the latter is separated into carbon monoxide  product gas and methane product gas, and the first gas  fraction is further cooled for additional partial condensation  and separated into a hydrogen enriched gas fraction and a  second carbon monoxide rich liquid.
