<ABSTRACT>
device for selecting the colour of weft threads in looms,  characterized in that the mechanism (m) controlling the  weaving programme transmits a mechanical order to a so  called colour selector (a) which converts the said order in a  first electric signal which is sent to a synchronization device  (c) and is momentarily stored therein, whereas a second  signal is produced by a damping disc (d) and a contactless  switch (s) as a function of the rotation of the axis of the loom,  whereby the said first signal is sent by the said synchroniza­ tion device to a so called colour giver (b) as soon as the said  second signal has reached the said synchronization device.

<DESCRIPTION>
colour selector the present invention relates to a device for selectively presenting weft threads of different colours to the grippers of a loom which are equipped with a jacquard or a dobby mechanism. it is known that the said mechanisms are actuating a series of pulling hooks or levers, whereby as well the weaving pattern as the various colours may be determined in the fabric. numerous systems are known for selecting weft threads having different coulours and for presenting them to the grippers; however, a large number of said systems have important drawbacks resulting from the difficult synchronization between the jacquard or dobby mechanism and the loom, principally at the presently applied high weaving speeds. the object of the present invention is to prevent such drawbacks by providing a new device which has not the abovementioned shortcomings. according to this invention, the control for the colour selection of the jacquard or dobby mechanism is transmitted to a double pulling hook or lever actuating a contactless switch producing a signal actuating, through a synchronization device, a device presenting a weft thread of a defined colour to the gripper as soon as the said signal is received. the scope of this invention will be more clearly apparent from the following description of a non limitative embodiment given by way of example, reference being made to the enclosed drawings in which figure 1 is a block diagram of the whole device according to the invention; figure 2 is a cross-section of the device through which the colour is selected; figure 3 is a top view of the double lever according to the arrow f3 in figure 2; figure 4 is a diagrammatic view of a damping disc and the corresponding contactless switch; figure 5 is a cross-section of the device presenting the thread; and figure 6 is an operating diagram showing the relation between the opening of the shed and the rotation of the axis of the loom. the block diagram of figure 1 gives a general view of the device according to the invention. as known, for each weft, the nature of the weaving pattern and the sequence of the various colours in the fabric are ordered by a jacquard or a dobby mechanism m. these data are sent to a device consisting of a series of pulling hooks or levers, each lever relating either to the weaving pattern proper or to the colour of the weft thread being presented. however, in the present case, the levers relating to the selection of the colour of the weft thread are only considered. the device in which said levers are disposed is called a colour selector a which additionally comprises also the same number of contactless switches cooperating with the said levers. the signals emitted by said switches are synchronized in a device c with periodical signals produced by a damping disc d mounted on the driving axis of the loom or of the dobby or jacquard mechanism, and a contactless switch s, whereby

claims.   1.- device for selecting the colour of weft threads in looms, characterized in that the mechanism (m) controlling the weaving programme transmits a mechanical order to a so called colour selector (a) which converts the said order in a first electric signal which is sent to a synchronization device (c) and is momentarily stored therein, whereas a second signal is produced by a damping disc (d) and a contactless switch (s) as a function of the rotation of the axis of the loom, whereby the said first signal is sent by the said synchronization device to a so called colour giver (b) as soon as the said second signal has reached the said synchronization device.   2.- device according to claim 1,   characteried    in that the colour selector (a) comprises substantially a casing (1) in which are adapted a series of levers (2) and the same number of contactless switches (3), whereby each lever is at least of a double construction and both lever arms (4,5) are rotatably mounted on a common axis (6).   3.- device according to claim 2, characterized in that between the said levers arms (4,5) and at the level of the said common axis (6), is provided a small friction plate (9), e.g. made of metal or synthetic material, said plate being clamped between the said levers arms under the influence of a spring (10) adapted at the level of the said axis.   4.- device according to claim 2, characterized in that only one (5) of the said lever arms is folded back at its end (11) remote from the said axis, whereas the corresponding end of the other (4) lever arm is so provided that it may cooperate with the said mechanism (m) controlling the weaving programme.   5.- device according to claim 2, characterized in that the said casing (1) has at least one groove-shaped opening (13) in which the said lever arms (4) may be at least partially  shifted.   6.- device according to claim 2, characterized in that, in the said casing (1) and per lever arm (5), are provided at least two stops (14,15) which may be adjusted or not and which are defining the distance on which one lever arm (5) may be shifted in order to damp or undamp the said contactless switch (3).   7.- device according to claim 2, characterized in that only one double lever (4,5) is provided in the said device per selectable colour.   8.- device according to claim 2, characterized in that the colour selection is carried out according to a binary system, whereby n levers (4,5) and the same number of contactless switches (3) allow to sellect 2n colours.   9.- device according to claim 1, characterized in that the signals coming from the colour selector (1) are synchronized with the periodical signals produced by a damping disc (d) fixedly secured on the axis (16) of the loom and a contactless switch (3), whereby said damping disc is displaced on about   270     relative to the zero position of the said axis.    10.- device according to claim 1, characterized in that the said colour giver (b) comprises substantially a casing (23)in which an electromagnet (24), a hinged armature (25), a cam (26), an intermediate lever (27) and a lever (28) are .adapted for each colour so that, when a signal for colour selection is introduced into the said colour giver, the corresponding electromagnet (24) is energized, thereby pulling down the hinged armature (25), as a result of which and under the influence of the constant rotating movement of the cam (26), a swinging movement is imparted to the intermediate lever (29) round one end of the said hinged armature (25), whereby this movement is transmitted, -through an intermediate bar (31),  to a lever (28) provided with an arm (37) presenting the thread to a gripper.
