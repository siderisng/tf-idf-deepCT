<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for marking smooth hard surfaces, such as  vehicle windows, comprises a conventional blast gun (20)  supplied with compressed air from a compressor (22) for  conveying a granular abrasive material to a stencil box (1).   the granular material is heated prior to use and any water in  the compressed air is extracted by mechanical extractors (27)  prior to reaching the blast gun (20) in order to improve the  cutting efficiency of the material and enabling a clean mark  to be obtained on the target surface even in wet or humid  conditions.
