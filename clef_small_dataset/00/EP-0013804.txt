<ABSTRACT>
there is provided an improved continuous homogeneous  catalytic carbonylation process wherein a mixed gas stream is  removed from the carbonylation reactor, condensable liquids  separated from said gas stream and said gas stream vented,  the improvement comprising contacting said gas stream with a  plurality of hollow fiber membranes selectively permeable to  hydrogen under conditions substantially non-degrading of the  membranes generating a non-permeated gas stream gas  stream of higher carbon monoxide content and recycling said  non-permeated gas stream to the carbonylation process reac­ tor.  there is also provided for the recovery and recycle to the  process of carbonylation products such as acetic or propionic  acids by adsorption and removal from a solid adsorbent or ab­ sorption in a liquid absorbent.
