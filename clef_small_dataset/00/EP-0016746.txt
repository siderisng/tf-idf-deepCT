<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the general formula    wherein the dotted lines represent optional double bonus, x  represents a halogen or pseudohalogen selected from cl, br  or cf₃, and a represents a monoloweralkylamino group or  the group    wherein r is a hydroxyloweralkyl group, pharmaceutical  preparation and methods of treatment employing such  compounds.  the compounds are useful as neuropharmaco­ logical agents especially as neuroleptic or anti-psychotic  agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
new therapeutically active spirocycloalkylamines and pharmaceutical preparations comprising such compounds description technical field the present invention is related to new compounds of the spiro-dibenzocycloheptene-cyclohexaneamine type. an object of the invention is to provide compounds for therapeutic use. a further object is to provide compounds having a therapeutic activity in the central nervous system. bckgrd'unl art among the compounds disclosed by us patent 4 053 632 are compounds under the general formula emi1.1 wherein the dotted lines represent optional double bonds. the compounds have neuroleptic properties. disclosure of invention the present invention is related to compounds of the general formula emi2.1 wherein the dotted lines represent optional double bonds, x represents a halogen or pseudohalogen selected from cl, br or cf3 and a represents a monoloweralkylamino group or the group emi2.2 wherein r is a hydroxyloweralkyl group. lower alkyl means an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. the hydroxy group, when occurring, is optionally esterified with a fatty acid having 3 to 20 carbon atoms. pharmaceut- ically acceptable acid additions salts of the compounds of formula i are within the scope of the invention according to a preferred embodiment the invention is related to compounds of the formula emi2.3 wherein a is as defined above. preferred compounds of. the invention are those compounds of formula i or ia in which a represents the group emi3.1 the compounds of the invention as defined above have valuable therapeutic properties as neuropharmacological agents, especially in use as neuroleptic or anti-psychotic agents. further, the compounds of the invention have a reduced heart toxicity as compared with related known compounds. additionally the compounds of formula i may be useful as anti-depressive or anxiolytic agents. in a broadened concept the invention is related to compounds of formula i wherein a additionally represents the group nh2. the compounds wherein a is nh2 have a neuropharmacological activity and may be useful for treatment of certain neurological disoroers such as depression. the primary amines are further useful as intermediates in preparation of other compounds of the invention. the compounds of the invention exist in two diastereomeric forms, one wherein the chlorine atom and the nitrogen atom are in "cis" relationship to each other and one wherein said atoms are in "trans" relationship to each other. for convenience these diastereomers are referred to as "cis" and "trans" forms respectively. in compounds of the invention containing a double bond in the six-membered hydrocarbon ring each diastereomer exists as two optical antipodes or enantiomers. this invention also takes into consideration that compounds which structurally deviates from the formula i, after administration to a living organism may be transformed to compound of the formula i and in this structural form exert their effects. this consideration is a further aspect of this invention. methode of preparation the compounds of the invention may be obtained by one of the following methods, constituting a further aspect of the invention. a) reacting a compound of the formula emi4.1 wherein d represents emi4.2 or emi4.3 and n
