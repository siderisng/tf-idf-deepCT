<ABSTRACT>
phenol containing less than 30 ppm hydroxyacetone is  produced by feeding hydroxyacetone-contaminated phenol  obtained by the decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide,  which phenol is substantially free from cleavage catalyst and  light ends such as acetone and water, and up to 22% by  weight of cumene and/or alpha-methyl styrene to an intermediate  point in a distillation column from which there is  removed overhead a fraction containing cumene and/or  alpha-methyl styrene and a substantial proportion of the  hydroxyacetone in the feed and there is removed from the  base a fraction comprising phenol containing less than 30  ppm hydroxyacetone, whilst maintaining the column under  such conditions of temperature and pressure that cumene  and/or alpha-methyl styrene forms from 55 to 80% by  weight of the composition on the uppermost 15 to 70% of the  trays in the stripping section and phenol forms greater than  50% by weight of the composition on the bottommost 10 to  50% of the trays in the stripping section.
