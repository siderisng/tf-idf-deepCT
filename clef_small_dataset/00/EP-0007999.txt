<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a stand construction with four at least approaches in the corners of a rectangle, which - in the case of planes terrain - are in a common zero plane, to make adaptable to uneven terrain, is proposed that the supports (12) relative to the construction (10) in the same vertical direction to the zero plane movable and coupled together in such a way that when deflecting a first support (12) relative to the zero plane, a second to the first diagonally opposite support (12) relative to the zero plane in the same direction and approximately the samethe route is deflected, during the third and the fourth support (12) compared to the zero level in the opposite direction deflected those like the first and the second support (12), both around approximately the same route as the two first supports (12).
