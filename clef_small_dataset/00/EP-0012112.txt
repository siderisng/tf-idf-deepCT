<ABSTRACT>
a pressure-sensitive or heat-sensitive recording material  which contains in its colour reactant system, as developer for  colour formers, at least one compound of the formula    wherein z is the radical of a reactive organic methylene or  methyl compound or a radical of the formula    wherein each of a₁ and a₂ independently is carbon or unsubstituted  or substituted alkylene, arylene or aralkylene, each of  x₁ and x₂ is halogen, cyano or nitro, each of d₁, d₂ and e  independently is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, aralkyl,  aryl, alkanoyl, alkysulfonyl, aroyl, arylsulfonyl,  cyanoamidino, or is the group    wherein each of r₁ and r₂ independently is hydrogen or  unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, aryl or aralkyl, whilst d₁  and d₂ are also hydrogen, or each of the pairs of substituents  (r₁ and r₂) and (d₁ and e) together with the nitrogen atom to  which said pair is attached is a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic  radical, w is -co-, -so₂-, -coco-,   -co-  -co- or unsubstituted  or substituted alkylene or phenylene, g is unsubstituted  or substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl or is a 5- or 6-membered  heterocyclic radical, and m is 1 to 6.  the grouping -a₁-(x₁)m is  preferably -c(hal)₃ wherein hal is halogen.
