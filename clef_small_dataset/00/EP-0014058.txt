<ABSTRACT>
a turnable mounting for a record player comprises a  platform (4) for rotatably supporting a turntable (11).  the  turntable has three angularly spaced holes, and the shanks  of bolts (13) pass freely through the holes and are secured  into sockets (3) in the base (2).  compression springs (17)  on the bolts extend between the platform and nuts (16) on  the bolts, so that the platform is resiliently supported.  dur­ ing assembly, the nuts (16) are adjusted to provide the de­ sired tension in the springs and are set so as to turn with  the bolts if the latter are adjusted to effect levelling of the  platform.  in this way, the setting of the nuts and thus the  tension in the springs is not altered.  should the tension in  a spring require to be altered, the nut can be held by a  spanner whilst the bolt is turned.
