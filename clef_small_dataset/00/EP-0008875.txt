<ABSTRACT>
a device for plating a thin layer of a first metal onto the  surface 10 of a generally flat metal strip b formed of a second  metal as the strip is moving in a selected direction along a  given path includes an anode 50 and means for supplying  electrolyte l containing ions of the first metal between the  anode 50 and the moving strip.  the anode comprises an  electrically conductive, non-consumable, anode element 100  having an outer surface 102 with a transverse width substan­ tially as great as the width of the strip.  a plenum chamber 112  is formed behind the anode element 100 and generally coex­ tensive with the outer surface of the element so that apertures  70 in the anode element direct jets of electrolyte through the  anode element 100 and directly against the surface 10 being  plated to provide a uniformly turbulent flow of electrolyte at  the surface of the strip.
