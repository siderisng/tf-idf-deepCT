<ABSTRACT>
a rotary seal unit is fitted between a shaft (10) and a  surrounding member (14).  the unit comprises a runner (34)  fixed to the shaft and within an outer housing (16) fixed to the  surround member (14).  mating sealing rings (24,31) are  carried one by the housing and the other by the runner.  one of  the rings (24) is axially fixed while the other (31) is axially  slidable and urged by springs (44) towards said one ring (24).   the housing encloses and protects the sealing rings prior to  and during fitting.  a soft (or hard) setting ring (62) may be  provided to axially locate the axially fixed ring (24) and the  component (34) carrying the other ring (31), but permitting  rotation between them, so that the spring loading of the rings  is not disturbed during fitting.  the softer material wears away  in use.  the setting ring also protects against entry of dirt.  the  seals within the unit can be provided in axially spaced pairs,  defining a space (46) between them.
