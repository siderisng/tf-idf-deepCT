<ABSTRACT>
a motion transmitting device including eccentric means 5,  wheel means 7 having portions 31, e. g.  teeth,  shaped to engage with teeth 29 on links of a chain and having  movement-limiting means including a datum member so that  the teeth on the links move into and out of engagement with  those on the wheel means can form a speed changing or  torque conversion device in which the load is spread over  approximately a quarter of the teeth enabling high torques to  be obtained.  the present invention provides an improved  form of movement-limiting means for such a quadrant drive  transmission device in which certain practical limitations to  the load-carrying capacity are avoided.  this is achieved by  providing rollers 23 each engaging a first ovoid hole 41′ on the  datum member 40 and engaging a second ovoid hole 41 on a  meshing element 31, the meshing elements being separately  hingedly connected by pins 21, so separating a number of  functions which were all performed by the chain link pins in  the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in or relating to motion transmitting devices this invention relates to motion tran#mitting devices for transmitting rotary motion. tt relates more particularly to torque convertors and speed changing devices. conventional gearing employs two meshing gears and engagement is usually provided by one tooth from each gear or, at most, between a few adjoining teeth. therefore, at any given moment, one tooth or at best a few teeth transmit the entire load, the remaining teeth idly and wastefully rotating until their turn arrives to momentarily perform useful work. this waste is aggravated when large speed ratios are required. in such cases, rather than employing huge multitooth gears, several stages of conventional gearing are usually preferred or, alternatively, worm and gear or planetary gear mechanisms (such as epicyclic or hypocycloidal) are utilised, but in all such systems only one tooth per gear meshes (and transmits the load) at any given time and, when high torques are transmitted, this tooth may be subjected to very high loads. most of these problems were solved by our prior invention in rotary motion transmitting devices which is described in cur united states patent no. 4023440. in that specification constructions are described which make possible multitooth engagement and thereby multitooth transmission of load with all the ensuing advantages in size reduction, weight reduction and cost savings. such constructions are capable of large speed reductions-while they can simultaneously transmit high, or very high, loads. in fact, according to the above specification, devices may be constructed in which approximately one half the teeth of a gear may mesh at any given time and approximately one quarter may carry and share the load. such devices in which the load is spread over the gear 11 in this way have been termed "quadrant drives briefly, each device according to the above-referred prior specification includes eccentric means, wheel means having portions shaped to engage with linked but independently movable meshing elements, a movementlimiting means ¯including a datum member, wherein said eccentric means is arranged to cause said meshing elements sequentially to enter into and subsequentlv to move out of engagement with said portions of said wheel means, said meshing elements being individually guided by said movement-limiting means within predetermined limits of orbital motion relative to said datum member such that a plurality of adjacent areas of said meshing elements are always simultaneously in engagement with, and stationary relative to, a corresponding number of said portions. the wheel means typically is a toothed wheel and this construction enables a large number of teeth on the wheel to carry and share the load. more particularly in that specification constructions are described in which approximately one half of the teeth of a gear mesh at any given time and approximately one quarter carry and share the load as is described in that specification, in a motion transmitting device, if one considers the four integers, namely the eccentric means, meshing means, the wheel means and the movement-limiting means, one of these integers may be driven
