<ABSTRACT>
a programmable medical device, e. g.  a cardiac  pacemaker, utilizes digital circuitry 40 for controlling the pro­ vision of cardiac stimulating pulses and analog circuitry 42 for  providing clocks, an output circuit and heart activity sensing.   digital circuit 40 includes a memory in which may be prog­ rammed on a permanent or temporary basis from an external  programmer control information relating to rate, pulse width,  pulse amplitude, refractory period, sense amplifier sensitivity  and the mode of operation desired, in addition the output can  be inhibited or a threshold margin test can be performed in  which a reduced energy output pulse is provided to check if  heart capture is lost.  the pacemaker can operate in a hys­ teresis mode and provides a high rate limit which can how­ ever be exceeded by programming.  the pacemaker further  includes means for signalling the acceptance of a program­ ming signal and means to reset the program acceptance cir­ cuit if extraneous signals are detected as programming sign­ als.  the acceptance circuit checks for the receipt of the proper  number of signals within a given time, for an access code and  correct parity.  timing is by means of a crystal oscillator and a  voltage controlled oscillator controls pulse witdth to obtain  energy compensation with varying battery voltage.
