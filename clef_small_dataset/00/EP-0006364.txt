<ABSTRACT>
in a optical cable comprising at least one separate  optical fibre and/or optical bundle, the optical fibre or  bundle (4) is loosely housed in, or surrounded by, an elon­ gate compartment (11) bounded by a fluid-impermeable  wall or fluid-impermeable walls (6, 8).  the elongate com­ partment (11) extends throughout the cable length and  contains a fluid, e.  g.  air above or below atmospheric  pressure, at such a pressure that detection of a change  in pressure of the fluid will serve to indicate that a fluid-­ impermeable wall (6, 8) has been ruptured, e.  g.  by so­ meone illegally tapping the cable.  the cable may also  incorporate at least one electric conductor (5, 9) exten­ ding along the cable length radially outward of the op­ tical fibre or bundle and, when a detectable current is  flowing in the conductor (5, 9), constituting part of an elec­ tric alarm system.

<DESCRIPTION>
an tmproved optical cable this invention relates to optical cables for the transmission of the ultra-violet, visible and infra-red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, which regions, for convenience, will hereinafter all be included in the generic term "light," and especially, but not exclusively, to optical cables for use in the communlcation field adapted for trars- mission of light having a wavelength within the range 0.5 to 1.3 micrometres. optical cables for this purpose comprise at least one separate optical fibre and/or at least one optical bundle as hereinafter defined and examples of such optical cables are described and claimed in the complete specifications of our british patents nos. 1 479 426 and 1 479 427 and of our co-pending patent application no. 30474/77 (serial no. by the expression "optical bundle" is meant a group of optical fibres or a group of fibres including at least one optical fibre and at least one non-op'tical re ..',-zin- fibre or other reinforcing elongate member. each optical fibre of the optical bundle may be used independently as a separate light guide, each with its own modulated light source and detector, or a plurality of optical fibres of a bundle may be'used together as a single light guide, with a single light source. it is in the interests of users of optical cables forming part of a communications system that the system should be protected against illegal tapping of transmitted signals and it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved optical cable of such a form that any tapping of the cable can readily be detected. according to the invention, in the improved optical cable the separate optical fibre or fibres and/or the optical bundle or bundles is or are loosely housed in, or surrounded by, an elongate compartment bounded by a fluid-impermeable wall or fluid-impermeable walls, which elongate compartment extends throughout the length of the cable and contains a fluid at such a pressure that detection of a change in pressure of said fluid will serve to indicate that the fluid-impermeable wall or one of the fluid-impermeable walls has been ruptured. the optical cable has the important advantage that there is no visible indication to a person wishing to tap the cable illegally that the cable incorporates an alarm system for alerting that the cable has been opened up. the fluid may be air or any other suitable gas at a pressure above or below atmospheric pressure or it may be a liquid, e.g. water. when the optical fibre or fibres and/ or optical bundle or bundles is or are loosely housed in the elongate compartment containing a fluid under said pressure, the fluid will be a gas or liquid to which the or each optical fibre is inert and which will have no deleterious effect on the transmission characteristics of the cable. in its simplest form, the elongate compartment of the optical cable is the bore of a tube in which the or each separate optical fibre and/or optical

what we claim is:   1. an optical cable comprising at least one separate optical fibre and/or at least one optical bundle as hereinbefore defined, characterised in that the separate optical fibre or fibres and/or the optical bundle or bundles is or are loosely housed in, or surrounded by, an elongate compartment bounded by a fluid-impermeable wall or fluid-impermeable walls, which elongate compartment extends throughout the length of the cable and contains a fluid at such a pressure that detection of a change in pressure of said fluid will serve to indicate that the fluid-impermeable wall or one of the fluid-impermeable walls has been ruptured.   2. an optical cable as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the fluid is air or other gas at a pressure above or below atmospheric pressure.   3. an optical cable as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the fluid is water or other liquid.   4. an optical cable as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the elongate compartment is the bore of a tube in which the or each separate optical fibre and/or optical bundle is loosely housed, the wall of the tube being of fluid-impermeable material and the bore of the tube containing fluid under said pressure.     5. an optical cable as claimed in any one   or    the preceding claims, characterised in that the optical cable also includes, radially outwardly of the or each optical fibre and/or optical bundle, at least one electric conductor which extends throughout the length of the cable and along hitch a detectable current can be caused to flow, an   inner      eruption    in the current flow indicating that the   conductor    has been cut.    an   optical    cable as claimed in claim   a,      caracterised    in that the or each electric conductor is embedded in or positioned radially inwardly of the cable sheath, or of the   flud-imnermeable    wall which is radially   ou'.':ardly    of the or each optical fibre and/or optical bundle, so that there is no visible indication that the cable includes an electric alarm system.   7. an optical cable as claimed in claim 6,   naracterised    in that the electric conductor is a circumferentially contin- uous conductor that surrounds the separate optical fibre or fibres and/or optical bundle or bundles and   tat    is embedded in the cable sheath or said fluid-impermeable wall.   s. an optical cable as claimed in 'any one of claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the optical cable includes inner and outer electric conductors radially spacea apart and electrically insulated from one another; in   tat    the  elongate compartment is a bore in, and extending throughout the length of, the inner conductor   andbr    a compartment extending throughout the length of the cable between the inner and outer conductors and surrounding the inner conductor; and in that the or each separate optical fibre and/or optical bundle is loosely housed in the bore of the inner conductor and fluid   nder    said pressure is contained in said bore or in the compartment between the inner and outer conductors.   9. an optical cable as claimed in any one of claims   5    to 7, characterised in that the optical cable includes inner and outer electric conductors radially spaced apart and electrically insulated from one another; in that the elongate compartment is a compartment extending throughout the length of the cable between the inner and outer conductors and surrounding the inner conductor; and in that the or each separate optical fibre and/or optical bundle is loosely housed in the compartment between the inner and outer conductors and fluid under said pressure is contained in said compartment.    10. an optical cable as claimed in claim 9, wherein the inner and outer conductors are radially spaced apart by spacing means comprising at least one elongate member which extends helically around or substantially parallel to the inner   conductor w bylongitudinally    spaced discs each having   a,hole    or holes for longitudinal flow of fluid.
