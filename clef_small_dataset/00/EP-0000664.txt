<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a hairspray product having  improved hair-holding properties.  the hairspray composition  comprises, as is usual, a solution of a hairspray resin in a  suitable solvent, but to improve the holding power there is  also included a minor amount of a drag reducing agent  which is soluble in the solvent for the hairspray resin.  the  drag reducing agent is present in an amount such that the  weight ratio of the hairspray resin to the drag reducing agent  is 10,000 to 2:1.  the drag reducing agent amounts to less  than 0. 3% by weight of the composition.
