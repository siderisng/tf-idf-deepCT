<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for moulding sanitary articles such as washbasins comprising a mould carried by a frame and provided with a lower half-shell (3), an upper half-shell (4) pivotally mounted on the frame in such a manner as to undergo a pivotal displacement between a closed position in which a mould cavity is defined between the two half-shells and an open position which permits extraction of the moulded article from the lower half-shell (3), and provided with means for the introduction of slip into the mould cavity (5) as well as means of the discharge of slip from the said cavity, characterized in that the mould comprises an intermediate drying flangeplate (8) placed in the closed position between the two half-shells (3, 4) and pivotally coupled to the frame in such a manner as to undergo pivotal displacement between the closed position and at least one position of withdrawal, the said flange-plate (8) being such as to define a peripheral bearing surface on which only the edge of the sanitary article is applied both in the closed position and in the withdrawn position(s) of the said flange-plate.
