<ABSTRACT>
method of manufacturing patterns with which sand casting moulds are produced.  the mould surface of a female mould of the pattern is provided with a thin, porous coating of metal by flame spraying.  this coating is back-filled with a synthetic casting resin which penetrates into the pores of this metal coating.  the side of the metal coating facing away from the synthetic compound forms the mould surface of the pattern manufactured in this way.  <image>
