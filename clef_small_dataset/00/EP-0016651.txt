<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus are provided for classifying  areas on a raster-type display unit.  as shown, the unit has a  scan/video processor (svp) which presents graphic data  from picture element stores (st1-st4) for display on a video  monitor (vm).  the problem is to identify areas defined by a  closed boundary - e. g.  for filling in such areas.  boundary data  are entered, e. g.  by vector generator (vg), into a first  "polygon" store (pst) which has a plurality of memory  locations each corresponding to a respective dot position of  the display field, and at least one seed point is identified.   each dot position is then examined to see whether there  exists a connected path, not including a boundary position,  from it to a seed point, and if there is, this fact is recorded in a  second, "fill" store (fst).  the criterion for deciding whether  or not a path is connected depends on the definition of what  constitutes a closed boundary.
