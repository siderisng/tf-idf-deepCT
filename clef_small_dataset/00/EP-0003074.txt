<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a process for the  preparation of 4-(6¹-methoxy-2¹-naphthyl) butan-2-one and  to certain compounds for use in that process.  british patent specification no.  1,474,377 discloses inter  alia that 4-(6¹-methoxy-2¹-naphthyl) butan-2-one possesses  useful anti-inflammatory activity.  a particularly favoured  process has now been discovered that can be used to  produce 4-(6¹-methoxy-2¹-naphthyl) butan-2-one in particularly  good yield.  the present invention provides a process for the preparation  of 4-(6¹-methoxy-2¹-naphthyl)butan-2-one which process  comprises the hydrogenation of a compound of the  formula (i):    wherein ar is a 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl group; x and y are  each hydrogen atoms or together represent a second bond  between the carbon atoms to which they are attached; and r  is a group such that -co₂r represents an ester group  convertible by hydrogenation to a co₂ h group.
