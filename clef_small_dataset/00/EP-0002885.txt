<ABSTRACT>
a passive three-point lap and shoulder belt system has  the inboard ends of the lap (24) and shoulder (26) belts  mounted on the vehicle body (10) generally adjacent the  hip of the occupant by an emergency release buckle (28,  30).  lap and shoulder belt retractors (46) are mounted on  the door generally adjacent the hip of the occupant for  winding the belts thereon upon closing movement of the  door and unwinding the belts therefrom upon opening  movement of the door.  an anchor loop (42) is mounted on  the door generally adjacent the shoulder of the occupant  and slidably receives the shoulder belt to dispose the  shoulder belt diagonally across the chest of the occupant  when the door is closed and forwardly of the occupant  when the door is open.  a guide loop (64) is attached to the  shoulder belt at a point thereon which travels between the  retractor and the anchor loop during movement of the  door between open and closed positions.  the guide loop  slidably receives the lap belt to lift the lap belt from the  retractor and vertically along the door toward the anchor  loop during opening movement of the door so that the lap  belt assumes a stowed occupant access position generally  parallel with the shoulder belt to facilitate occupant ingress  and egress.  closing of the door winds the shoulder belt  and lowers the lap belt to the restraining position across  the lap of the occupant.
