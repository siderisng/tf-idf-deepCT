<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for manufacturing building units in pallet moulds is particularly suitable for the production of precast concrete units and consists of a conveying device (1) and a number of heat treatment units (4) arranged one above the other.  a mould (3) is introduced into each of these units, which are assembled to form a block (2).  a continuous working procedure is achieved by filling and emptying in consecutive steps.  the heat treatment programme can begin immediately for each mould (3) and can be adapted to the type of unit.  the conveying device (1) can be designed with a tilting frame (14) and vibrating beams (21) as a working platform.  <image>
