<ABSTRACT>
a corrugated tubular filter element (1) is provided, resistant  to corrugation collapse under high differential pressure,  although formed of filter sheet material susceptible to such  collapse, comprising, in combination, filter sheet material (2)  enclosed in a dual layer of more open foraminous sheet material  and formed in a closed corrugated configuration having  axial corrugation folds arranged in groups (4) with adjacent  side surfaces in supporting contact with each other; and,  interposed between said groups, solid wedge support elements  (10) extending axially of the corrugation folds from end  to end of the element having side surfaces in supporting  contact with external side surfaces of the end folds of each  group, substantially filling the spaces between the end folds  of adjacent groups, and confining the folds of each group in  substantially parallel array against lateral movement; and a  foraminous support sheath (15, 16) disposed at least one of  externally and internally of the filter sheet material in supporting  contact with adjacent fold ends and retaining the wedge  support elements and folds against one of outward and  inward movement.
