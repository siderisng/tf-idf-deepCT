<ABSTRACT>
a method of cooling a flow of a molten material involves  simultaneously subjecting the flow to a stirring action which  is such that the temperature of the material is substantially the  same at any point in any one plane perpendicular to the  direction of flow.  the cooling may be applied to a molten  material to bring it either closer to its melting point of liquidus  temperature or to bring it within its freezing range where this  is desired as in, for example, the production of metallic slur足 ries.  in apparatus for cooling a flow of a molten material hav足 ing means for cooling and means for simultaneously stirring  the flow, both means preferably comprise at least one ele足 ment extending transversely within a duct through which the  flow is directed.  the element, which may be a hollow rod  arranged to carry a flow of a coolant, is preferably made of a  highly conducting material e. g.  graphite or a metal whereas  the walls of the duct are preferably of a insulating material.  by  this means nearly all of the cooling effect can be concentrated  in the elements which permits close control over the cooling  action.  the number, arrangement and size of the elements  will depend on the degree of cooling required and on the  amount of stirring which is necessary to achieve even cooling  along the duct.  the cooled flow, after passing through the duct, is conve足 niently led into a mould or series of moulds or into a casting  machine in which solidification to give a shaped article takes  place.
