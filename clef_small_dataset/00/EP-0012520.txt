<ABSTRACT>
an electrical switch having spaced stationary contacts  (40, 41) and a contact carrier (c) carrying a bridging con足 tact (44) in linear reciprocation relative to the stationary  contacts, with the bridging contact biased toward the sta足 tionary contacts.  the bridging contact is linearly movable  by the contact carrier and is rotatably hinged to the contact  carrier and a projection (60) is disposed between the sta足 tionary contacts for engagement with the leading contact  end (46) for pivoting and lifting the leading contact end  from its stationary contact in coaction with the hinged con足 nection with a quick break action during movement of the  contact carrier to the non-bridging position.  each conductor wire (70) connected to the switch is  releasably secured therein by a spring-like retainer blade  (72) biased diagonally against the wire.  each retainer blade  has a release arm (78) for deactivating the retainer blade  thus permitting easy withdrawal of the conductor wire.
