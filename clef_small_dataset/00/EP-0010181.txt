<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve space utilization in absorption cooling furniture and to increase the effectiveness of cooling, a special design of the evaporator rib body (20) is proposed, which consists of a base plate (22) and of associated cooling fins (23).The base plate is parallel to a wall of the cooling furniture (1) and has a protrusion (21) directed against the space (3) directed against the space to be cooled (21) into which the horizontal or slightly inclined evaporator tube (17) of the cooling unit (1O).Above and / or below the out of book (21) protrude with the base plate thermally conductive verbun denective cooling fins in the room to be cooled.Such shaping of the rib body favors the convective heat transfer.Furthermore, the evaporator tube does not require any additional space or depth in such a design because it is within the rib body cross.
