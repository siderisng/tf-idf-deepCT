<ABSTRACT>
activated sludge is circulated at a first stage around a  system comprising a downcomer 12 and a riser 13 communiÂ­ cating with each other at their upper and lower ends, an  oxygen-containing gas being supplied to the sludge as it  passes through the downcomer or riser or both.  aerated  sludge is then fed to a second stage (15) in which it is mixed  with raw sewage and in which absorption, adsorption and/or  biosorption of sewage occurs.  subsequently, the resulting  mixutre is fed to a third stage (18) where the sludge and  liquid are separated.  the separated liquid is decanted and at  least part of the separated sludge is returned to the  downcomer/riser system.

<DESCRIPTION>
"treatment of bioloaicalls-degradable waste" this invention relates to a method and apparatus for the treatment of liquid borne biologically-degradable waste material hereinafter referred to for convenience as sewage. methods commonly used in the treatment of sewage comprise an initial treatment by screening and sedimentation to remove coarse and heavy material followed by a further treatment employing biological methods to remove organic materials. the present invention'relates in particular to the further treatment stage. in the well known activated sludge process raw sewage, after initial treatment, is circulated for a period of 7 - 8 hours in an aerated tank so that organic materials are oxidised or converted into activated sludge by biological action promoted by the micro-organisms present in the sewage. the activated sludge is then separated from the liauid component of the sewage in settling tanks. most of the activated sludge may then be fed back so as to mix with the sewage in the aerated tank whilst the excess sludge is then ultimately disposed of. it is also well known to replace the aerated tank with a so-called deep shaft as, for example, described in rp. #, 473' 665 in which sewage is caused to circulate around a system including a down-comer and a riser during which an oxygen containing gas (commonly air) is introduced into the sewage in the down-comer. as :as resulted in an increased transfer rate for - er. in the aerating gas into the sewage and in a 3curable reduction in the land area required for sewage treatment plants. the biosorption process resulted from the discovery that if activated sludge is mixed with sewage in an aeration tank and samples are removed at regular intervals of time, the amount of organic matter, i.e. the biological oxygen demand (b.o.d.) loading of the settled supernatent followed a curve wherein there was an immediate drop in the b.o.d. followed by a rise and a second drop. the biosorption process comprises mixing the raw sewage, after initial treatment, with a high concentration of activated sludge for 20 to 60 min. to assimilate the organic material on to the activated sludge by absorption, adsorption and/or biosorption. the sludqe is then separated from the supernatant liquor in a settling tank and concentrated sludge is then aerated to stabilise the organic matter and to renew the activated sludge surfaces in an aerating tank before it is returned for re-mixing with the influent sewage. excess sludge is disposed of in any convenient manner. the invention provides in one aspect a method of treating sewage, comprising at a first stage circulating activated sludge around a system comprising a downcomer (i.e. a chamber of descending flow) and a riser (i.e. a chamber of ascending flow) communicating with each other at their upper and lower ends, an oxygencontaining gas (as hereinbefore defined) being supplied to the sludge as it passes through the downcomer, feeding the aerated sludge to a second stage in which it is mixed with influent sewage and in which absorption, adsorption and/or biosorption
