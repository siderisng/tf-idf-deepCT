<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method for periodically generating  a display measurement with an improved stability, said a­ paratus comprising: a sensor (100) associated with an  analog/digital converter (200) generating a digital signal  corresponding to the measurement sensed by the sensor  (100) and including a portion of more significant digits and  a portion of less significant digits; a display device (500)  including a plurality of discrete indicators; a storage buffer  (400) coupled to the a/d converter (200) and the display  device (500) and receiving the more significant digits; and  a logic (300) coupled to the a/d converter (200) and the  storage buffer (400) and receiving the less significant di­ gits the less significant digits being analyzed by the logic  (300) and used to inhibit the application of the more signi­ ficant digits from the buffer (400) to the display device  (500) when the less significant digits are adjacent to a  transition of the more significant digits (i. e. , when one  count more or less in the digital signal causes a change in  the more significant digits).
