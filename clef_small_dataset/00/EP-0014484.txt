<ABSTRACT>
the present invention encompasses devices which are  used in the vagina to deliver spermicidal surfactants.  these  devices can be inserted by the user, and do not require  insertion by a physician as, for example, in the case of  intrauterine contraceptive devices.  by virtue of their unique  construction and shape, the devices herein are foldable for  easy insertion.  once in position at the cervical os, the devices  open to "cap" the os and remain in position, even during  intercourse, so that access of the spermicidal surfactant  source to the cervical os is not interrupted.  the devices are  designed to remain comfortably in the vagina during the time  between menstrual periods to provide desirable, prolonged  release of a spermicidal surfactant, and their contruction and  shape facilitate retention therein while minimizing awareness  and discomfort.  an effective between-period contraceptive  device is thereby provided.
