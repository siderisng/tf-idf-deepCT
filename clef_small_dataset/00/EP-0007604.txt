<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous dye preparations of water insoluble to heavy-soluble dyes, which are used to prepare pressure pastes for printing on textile materials and for printing on carrier materials for transfer printing.These preparations are characterized in that they are at least 10% by weight of water, 25-60 weight percent of a fine dispersion in water-insoluble to heavy-soluble dye, 0.1 - 5 weight percent of at least one water-soluble aminoplast precondensate, 0.5 - 5 weight percent of a nonionic copolymer of ethylene oxidewith a further olefin oxide having at least 65% by weight of ethylene oxide content and a molecular weight over 12000 and optionally further non-ionogenic additives.
