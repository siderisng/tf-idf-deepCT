<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an improved method and  apparatus for the production of a warp-free corrugated  cardboard from a corrugating machine.  in one aspect a method for producing warp-free corru­ gated cardboard (17) is characterised in that a continuously  running web of corrugated cardboard is induced with al­ ternate upward and downward warps by applying moisture  alternately to the two liners (13, 16) of said corrugated card­ board for each length corresponding to a first predeter­ mined number of cut cardboard sheets, and subsequently,  after said web of corrugated cardboard has been con­ tinuously cut into sheets having a predetermined cut length,  a second predetermined number of said sheets are success­ ively stacked so that said induced warps may be reformed  by the weight of the sheets themselves.  preferably, the se­ cond predetermined number should be chosen to be an  integral multiple (2 or more multiple) of the first predeter­ mined number.  another aspect of the invention resides in the apparatus  for effecting the method of the invention.
