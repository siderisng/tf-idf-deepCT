<ABSTRACT>
a method of preparing a hair conditioning product comprising incorporating an aqueous suspension of a metal salt of pyridinethione, especially zinc pyridinethione, wherein the salt is suspended using a cathionic suspending agent, in a liquid vehicle comprising a cationic hair conditioning agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
composition for treating human hair this invention relates to a process for the preparation of a product for application to human hair after shampooing to impart an attractive appearance and manageability, and to combat dandruff. it is well known that shampooing removes oils from the hair and leaves it clean but with a rather dull appearance and rather difficult to arrange into a desired style. to counteract these undesirable effects products are available for application to the hair after shampooing to restore an attractive gloss and manageability such products usually contain cationic substances which are substantive to or coat the individual hair shafts. they are often generically called '2conditioners" or "conditioning rinses". zinc pyridinethione is a known antidandruff agent, often included in shampoos. during shampooing it is deposited on the hair and scalp, but a large proportion is washed out during rinsing, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the treatment. it would therefore be desirable if zinc pyridinethione (or another metal salt of pyridinethione effective against dandruff) could be applied to the hair after shampooing and rinsing. one way this might be achieved would be to incorporate the pyridinethione salt in a traditional hair conditioner preparation, to obtain the benefits of good appearance and manageability as well as dandruff control. zinc pyridinethione can be supplied as a dry powder or an aqueous suspensio but the latter is almost always used because of severetoxicity and handling problems with the powder. zinc pyridinethione suspension is commercially available only using anionic suspension aids. these anionic suspension aids are incompatible with the cat ionic conditioning agents found in conditioner products. according to the present invention there is provided a method for the preparation of a composition for treating human hair comprising incorporating an aqueous suspension of a metal salt of pyridinethione wherein said salt is maintained in suspension by means of a cationic suspending agent, in liquid vehicle co.nprising a cationic conditioning agent. since it has not previously been practicable to prepare a hair conditioning product including a salt of pyridinethipne, the compositions prepared by the method of this invention are new. accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a composition for treating human hair comprising a liquid vehicle comprising a cationic conditioning agent± and, suspended therein by means of a cationic suspending agent, a metal salt of pyridinethione. by the term "conditioning agent" is meant a substance which is substantive to and/or which coats hair fibres to impart a visual gloss andjor manageability to the hair as a whole. such substances are well known in the hair-care art. they are often quaternary ammonium compounds. examples of cationic conditioning agents include quaternary ammonium compounds such as stearyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, n-stearyl colaminoformyl methyl pyridinium chloride; cetyl ethyl morpholinium 2-etho-sulphate, and mink-amidopropyl dimethyl 2-hydroxyethyl ammonium chloride. the liquid vehicle comprising the conditioning agent may be an oil-in-water emulsion in which the cationic conditioning agent is present in the oil phase. such emulsions can be prepared by
