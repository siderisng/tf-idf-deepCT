<ABSTRACT>
ink is supplied to the nib (2) of the pen under the  control of a motor-actuated ink delivery device (9).  an ink  holder (1a) is formed covering a slit region (4) of the nib  (2) to form an ink pool (1) between the ink holder and the  nib.  a detector (6) is provided for detecting the quantity of  ink in the ink pool (1) at any time.  a pen holder (5) supÂ­ ports the nib (2), and includes an ink reservoir (8) opening  into the ink pool (1).  the ink delivery device (9) is coupled  to the ink reservoir (8) for delivering ink to the ink pool (1)  under pressure.  an electrical power source (15) and a  power delivery circuit are provided for controlling the flow  of current to an operating motor (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
fountain pen this invention relates to a fountain pen provided with means for automatically supplying ink to its nib in a controlled manner. a conventional fountain has a pen feed for feeding ink from an ink reservoir to the nib. the pen feed has an ink groove along which the ink runs, and an air groove for introducing air. unfortunately, if an ink reservoir having a large capacity is provided in the pen holder, ink may ilow over the nib, resulting in ink dripping. this occurs because the ink may be supplied to the nib at an excessively high rate due to a pressure or temperature change. as the ink is used, the internal pressure in the ink reservoir decreases until air is drawn into the ink reservoir. at which time the internal pressure increases. thugs, when writing with the pen, the internal pressure in the ink reservoir alternately decreases and increases, resulting in a pulsating flow of ink. as a result, the user's handwriting is likely to be irregular in density. in order to give accent to handwriting, it is necessary to increase the writing pressure. upon increasing the writing pressure in a conventional fountain pen, the slit in its nib tends to open thereby stopping the flow of ink onto the paper. moreover, if a conventional fountain pen is not used for a relatively long time, the ink tends to dry making it difficult to commence writing satisfactorily. the aim of the invention is to provide a fountain pen which does not suffer from the above-described difficulties. the present invention provides a fountain pen comprising a nib, an ink reservoir, means for transferring ink from the ink reservoir to the nib, and an electric power source for powering the transfer means. advantageously, the nib has a slit region, and an ink pool is formed between the nib and an ink holder. this allows -the:lnk to be transferred continuously onto a sheet even if the slit in the nib is opened, and to commence writing satisfactorily even if the nib was initially dry. moreover, even if the ink has dried in the slit, application of writing pressure will open the slit to break the dried ink so that ink can again pass through the slit to the point of the nib. in this connection, as the ink pool is adjacent to the nib, the ink can be more quickly supplied than if the ink pool were to be provided at other positions. the ink holder may be in the form of a flat plate or a plate member which is curved, in cross-section, towards the nib. alternatively, the ink holder may be in the form of a flexible cylinder having a hole which communicates with the slit region of the nib. again, the pen may further comprise a pen feed, and the ink holder may be formed as a recess in a surface of the pen feed which confronts the slit region of the nib. only an ink introducing
