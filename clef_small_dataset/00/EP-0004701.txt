<ABSTRACT>
a method of and apparatus for reducing priming and  carrier sweep-out losses in scr switching circuits by delaying  the rise of scr current upon such switching for a  predetermined priming interval, thereby also generating  additional minority carriers in the scr; limiting the current  during the priming interval; thereafter generating a reverse  voltage to effect sweep-out of such minority carriers during a  sweep-out interval, limiting the current during the sweep-out  interval; and transferring the energy resulting in each of said  priming and sweep-out intervals back to the power supplies  to reduce heat dissipation of the said resulting energy.
