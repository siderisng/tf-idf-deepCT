<ABSTRACT>
this invention is directed to stable dispersions of  copolymers in polyols containing added unsaturation.  the  polymer dispersions are prepared by reacting a polyol containing  added ethylenic unsaturation and an ethylenically  unsaturated monomer or mixtures thereof in the presence of  a free radical catalyst characterized in that the dispersion is  prepared by the williamson synthesis or a phase transfer  catalyst modification thereof employing in situ polymerization  of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer or mixtures  thereof in the polymer containing added ethylenic unsaturation.   the unsaturated polyols prepared by these methods  may be used alone or they may be blended with polyols not  containing added unsaturation.  the dispersions are relatively  low viscosity liquids which are useful in the preparation  of polyurethanes such as, for example foams and elastomers.
