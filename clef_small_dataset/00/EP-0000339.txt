<ABSTRACT>
a combination breast pump and gavage feeding apparatus  and method, the apparatus including means (100)  for applying suction to the nipple portion of a mammary  gland while accommodating manual manipulation of the  mammary gland for colostrum extraction and improved  lactation.  a pulse unit (127) may also be included in the  apparatus to impart the desired manipulatory action to at  least the areola portion of the breast engaged by the breast  pump.  air pressure and wall thickness and contour of the  pulse unit are used in the pulse unit to provide the desired  manipulatory action.  the apparatus also includes interchangeable  reservoir means (107) for collecting the colostrum  and/or milk therein for subsequent oral feeding and/  or gavage feeding.  a syringe barrel is configurated as the  reservoir means for the gavage feeding portion of the apparatus.
