<DESCRIPTION>
a process and apparatus for thermodinamically determining the elasto-plastic limit load. this invention relates to a method of determining the limit of elasticity in (metal) structural materials, the associated apparatus used, and its use. particularly, the invention aims to determine a parameter qualifying the elasto-plastic properties of a material. in structure design, the goal is to specify the boundary between elastic and plastic behaviour in materials. due to operative problems, which are solved by the present invention, the so-called yield point is commonly referred to. the standard for specifying such parameter is based on stress-deformation uni characteristic curve(6-g)and varies depending on the nature of the material. two typical cases should be pointed out. i) there is a sharp change in slope of the characteristics curve(6-±) in this case, the yield point coincides with the point of largest change in slope. ii) the slope of the characteristic curve(±)continuously varies, tending to become zero at plastic zone: in this case, said yield point is conventionally obtained as that load which corresponds to a permanent deformation of 0.2% of the initial test length. in such a case, a straight line is drawn parallel to the tangent at the origin of the curve #-#), and passing through the point of the cordinates having a deformation 8 = 0.2% and allotting to load 6 0.2 intercepted by such a straight line on the curve(6 & the significance of yielding point. particularly, in this second case, which is the most common case, the standard appears to be artful. moreover, due to the difficulty in specifying the direction of the tangent at the origin of the curve(6-±, the slope of which continuously varies particularly in austenitic stainless steels, the inherent uncertainty in these tests may lead to the provision of structures which are stressed either too much or too little, since in a great deal of materials a thus defined yielding point is localized quite far away from the region exhibiting an elastic behaviour. this could influence costs and even safety in most serious cases. on the other hand, it is known that during tensile tests, variations occur in the specimen temperature, in addition to changes in load and deformation. particularly, a study published in the name of d. ronnpagel following the priority date of this application (j. phys. e: sci, instrum., vol. 12 1979) teaches the possibility of using such variations in temperature in order to quantitatively disting,uish the thermic energy developed by mechanical deformation during the stationary plastic condition following the thermo-elastic cooling. however, the problem was never dealt with to assure whether and to which extent said variations in temperature are in mutual relationship with the characteristics of elastoplastic transition. particularly, but not exclusively referring to case ii), it is the primary object of the apparatus according to the present patent application to univocally establish the load relating to the limit between small elastic deformations and plastic deformations,8 (3. thus, in design calculations, lower factors of safety than those commonly used can be allotted
