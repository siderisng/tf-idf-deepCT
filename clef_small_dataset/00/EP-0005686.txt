<ABSTRACT>
a hand held machine tool intended for grinding and like  operations, having an outer housing (10) lodging a pneumatic  vane motor (11) by which a tool carrying spindle is  rotated.  at its forward end, the motor is supported in the  housing by a resilient o-ring (29) for absorbing radial  vibrations arising in the spindle during work and a conical  thrust ball bearing (30) for transferring axial load to the  housing without restraining the radial resiliency provided by  the o-ring.  at its rear end, the motor is supported in the  housing by a substantially non-resilient o-ring (38), which  means that the motor is apt to perform a pendular movement  about its rear end when exposed to vibrations from the  spindle.
