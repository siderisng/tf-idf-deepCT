<ABSTRACT>
barium oxide is used as an ethoxylation catalyst for the  reaction of ethylene oxide and alkanols of all classes.  the  reaction is carried out at temperatures of from about 200  to about 500Â°f to yield the ethoxylated product.  the product  abtained has a very narrow, high adduct distribution  with low levels of by-products and unreacted free alcohols.   calcium and magnesium oxides show no catalytic effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
barium oxide catalyzed ethoxylation this invention relates to the production of ethoxylated alcohols by reacting said alcohols with ethylene oxide. more particularly, this invention relates to the production of ethoxylated alcohols by reacting said alcohols in the presence of a barium oxide catalyst. the general reaction of alcohols and ethylene oxide to form ethoxylated alcohols or ethylene oxide adducts, has long been known and practiced on a commercial scale. for example, these ethylene oxide adducts have been used as detergents and cleaning agents, domestic and industrial laundry detergents, detergent builders, polishes, sanitizers, and dry cleaning materials. other users include the pulp and paper industry, and the fiber industry. these materials are especially adapted to these uses since they have functional properties such as wetting power, foaming, emulsifying and dispersing abilities as well as solublization and detergent abilities to facilitate their use. much literature is available in the general area of ethoxylation of alcohols. many references are also available relating to the catalytic ability of various materials, and the mechanism and kinetics of these reactions. for example, french patent 1,365,945 teaches the use of compounds containing an active hydrogen atom reacted with ethylene oxide in the presence of alkali metal base. acidic catalysts in general are also known. however, the ethoxylation of alcohols inevitably produces a distribution of various adducts. for example, in surfactant applications an adduct with too few ethylene oxide molecules is not effective because of poor solubility, while an adduct with too many ethylene oxide molecules is likewise undesirable because of surface tension reduction per unit mass decreases drastically with increasing molecular weight. thus it has long been essential to produce and use ethoxylates with as sharp a distribution in the desired mole adduct range (5 to 10) as possible. acid catalyzed reactions such as that described above produce such ethoxylates, but these catalysts produce harmful side products such as dioxanes which must be separated and removed prior to use. russian patent 523,074 teaches that alkali metals and various carbonates can be used to catalyze this reaction. the side product formation in these base catalyzed reactions is very low, but in base catalyzed reactions the adduct distribution is undesirably broad, such that a large proportion of the product obtained is not useful. representative of, but not exhaustive of, the art in this area is u.s. patent 3,328,467 which describes the use of zeolites and modified zeolites as catalysts in ethoxylation reactions. french 1,557,407 uses triethyloxonium fluoroborate to catalyze such reactions. indeed, the art abounds with references to alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium and potassium hydroxide, tertiary amines and sodium metal. german offengungsschrift 2,639,564 teaches polyalkylation of active hydrogen compounds in the presence of sodium trifluoroborate or perchlorates of metals such as magnesium, calcium, manganese or zinc. u.s. patent 3,969,417 uses tertiary oxonium salts as a catalyst. however, all these materials have the disadvantages described and set forth above. it would therefore be of great benefit to provide a catalyst which provides the low by-product levels of base
