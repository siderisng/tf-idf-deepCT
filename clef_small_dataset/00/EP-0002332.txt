<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle seat has a seat part (10) mounted on a base  part by a suspension (12) which includes a gas spring (15).   valve means (18, 20) are provided to control the seat ride  position by controlling the entry and exit of compressed gas  into and out of the gas spring (15).  the difference between  the actual ride position and a selected ride position of the  seat part (10) is sensed, and a control circuit (a. r. c. ) is used  actuating the valve means (18, 20) to raise or lower the seat  part (10) to reduce this difference to zero.  in order to prevent  seat vibration, such as is caused by passage of a vehicle over  rough terrain, from continually causing actuation of the valve  means (18, 20) the control circuit is provided with desensitizing  means.
