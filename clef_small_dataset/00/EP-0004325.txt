<ABSTRACT>
1.  gear for window and door locks or the like with a gear housing (1), two toothed racks (10', 10") inside it on the housing front wall with contra-rotating adjustment, engaging or capable of engaging in each case with a connecting rod, and two bevel gears meshing on the one hand with one another and on the other hand in each case with one of the two toothed racks (10', 10"), of which again the one is supported directly in the housing side walls (2', 2") and fitted with a connector gearing (7), e. g.  a many-sided perforation for a control hand lever, while the other rests on one of the two threaded bushings (8") secured in the housing side walls (2', 2"), which constitute the retaining thread for the fastening bolts of the control hand lever's bearing collar, characterized by the fact that both bevel gears, in respect of their divided circle calibrations or outer contours, constitute identical twin bevel gears (4, 5; 14, 15), the overall breadth of which corresponds in each case to about 2/3 of the interior width of the housing, and that the graduated pinions located in the middle of the housing and which mesh directly with one another (4", 5"; 4', 5"; 14", 15"), in each case have a different divided circle calibration or outer contour from the outer graduated pinions (4', 5'; 4", 5'; 14', 15') of the corresponding twin pinion (4, 5 or 14, 15), which mesh with the toothed racks (10', 10") on opposite sidewalls of the housing (2' and 2") so that an exaggerated or periodically uneven thrust motion is imparted to at least one of the toothed racks (10', 10") which are to be adjusted.
