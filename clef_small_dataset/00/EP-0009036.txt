<ABSTRACT>
a saw blade (10) is provided with an arrangement and  form of teeth which reduces vibration, cutting noise and  chatter, and which enhances cutting speed and blade life.  in  addition to having teeth (12-18) arranged in recurrent groups  (11) wherein the teeth (12-18) alternately decrease and  increase in gullet depth and pitch with the tips of the teeth in  alignment and being set laterally to the same extend, the  smaller teeth are given a positive rake angle which increases  with decrease in tooth size so that the angle of attach of the  smaller teeth is sharper thereby causing them to dig in and  remove a larger clip, thereby tending to equalize the size of  the chips removed by the different teeth.
