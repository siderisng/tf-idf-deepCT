<ABSTRACT>
novel compounds of the formula    in which each of   r₁, r₂ and r₃ are independently alkyl, and   r is an optionally substituted aralkyl, phenyl, indolyl  or benzocycloalkyl radical.  they are prepared by acylating a corresponding com­ pound of formula   h₂n-r   with a corresponding compound    or a reactive derivative thereof.  the 4-sila carboxylic acids are novel and are prepared  in via intermediates of which several are novel and in which  the carboxylic radical is replaced by a methylol resp.  a  boron containing methylene group.  the compounds i are  useful as anti-atherosclerotic agents.
