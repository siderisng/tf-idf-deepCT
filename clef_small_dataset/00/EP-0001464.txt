<ABSTRACT>
for cleaning the outside as well as the inside of a filler  pipe in packaging machines of the kind which form a packaging  tube around the filler pipe it is suggested to use a  cleaning container (8) in the form of a tubular body (9)  and a detachable base (10).  the tubular body (9) surrounds  the lower end of the filler pipe (4) and has an inside  diameter greater than the outside diameter of the  packaging tube (3); it may be provided with spraying nozzles  (11).  the base (10) is provided with a controllable  outlet (16, 17).  cleaning is effected by circulation of a  cleaning liquid that may be delivered via the interior of the  filler pipe (4) as well as via separate nozzles (11) directed  towards the outside of the filler pipe (4).  the delivery of  cleaning liquid through the filler pipe (4) may be reduced  when the level in the cleaning container (8) exceeds a  predetermined limit.
