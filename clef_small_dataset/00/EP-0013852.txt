<ABSTRACT>
this is a modular-assembly door.  the assembly of the sections of the stanchions and the panels comprising the dovetail groove (11) has a male edge and a female edge (32) of v-shaped general cross-section, the opening of the v being greater for the male edge than for the female edge so that the sides (34, 35) of the latter are applied constantly on the inclined flanks of the male edge, while sliding obliquely against one another, when a more or less large pressure on one towards the other (arrow 38,39) is exerted, and this is produced when they are brought closer together with a sizeable pressure in order to slide the assembly guide (29) and when the effort is released in order that the sections or stanchions assembled draw constantly on the said assembly guide.  application to garage doors in particular.
