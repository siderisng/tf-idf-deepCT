<ABSTRACT>
in a method of and apparatus for measuring the rate of  fuel consumption of a vehicle driven by a liquid fuel, electriÂ­ cal distance pulses proportional in number to the distance  travelled (b) and electrical fuel pulses proportional in  number to the units of fuel consumed (a) are derived and fed  to a computer which computes the numerical relationship of  distance to fuel pulses; this relationship is converted by a  preset factor (d) which is dependent on the sytem of units to  be used and the physical constant of the vehicle and the  resultant distance per unit fuel consumption is displayed (h).
