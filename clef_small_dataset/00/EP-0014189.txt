<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the working up of ferrous ll sulphate heptahydrate by reaction with cacl2  into raw gypsum in which the slightly hydrochloric fecl2 -solution containing excessive cacl2  and obtained after precipitating the raw gypsum is mixed with burnt limestone or caco3  after precipitating the raw gypsum, whereupon fe ll is, at least partly, oxidized into fe lll by means of gaseous oxygen, particularly air, the precipitated iron oxide hydrates are separated and the produced cacl2  is recirculated, characterized in that the cacl2 -solution, which is mostly free of iron after precipitating feo(oh), is separated and that the raw gypsum is purified by adding thereto this cacl2 -solution free of iron and that the cacl2 -solution, which contains fe-ll-chlorides after purifying the raw gypsum, is used in the precipitation of the raw gypsum.
