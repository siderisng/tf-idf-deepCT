<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the production of stepped windows in layers consisting of insulating material (4) and electrode material (3) in the formation of an integrated semiconductor circuit, in which said layers are applied one above another on a semiconductor body or on a layer (2) arranged thereon, and are etched away with the aid of lacquer masks (5, 6) to such an extent that the lower layer (3) which is adjacent to the semiconductor body projects beyond the edge of the layer (4) which is arranged on top, characterized in that a single lacquer mask is used, and in that : - a) after the application of the layers (3, 4), the lacquer mask (6) is applied to the layer (4) which is arranged on the top, and the mask openings of the lacquer mask (6) are so selected that they lie above the windows which are to be etched into the lower layer (3), and are somewhat smaller than these windows ; b) subsequently, the upper layer (4) is selectively etched away through the mask opening, whereby the lacquer mask (6) is underetched by a predetermined length ; c) the lacquer mask (6), possibly after previous swelling, is heated above the flow point until it is deposited on the parts of the surface of the lower layer (3) exposed by the underetching ; and d) finally, the surfaces of the lower layer which are exposed by the lowered lacquer mask (5) are etched away.
