<ABSTRACT>
The paper transport device allows optional several different paper transport paths. The paper transport takes place via a pivotable toothing lever, which drives a paper transport roll over a freewheel. The toothed segment lever is pivoted by a cam plate (4) and a curve lever (5) rotating with the cam rotary lever (5) by a plurality of difference in low oppressions (A, B, C, D) at different angles which result in different paper transport paths. The selection of different paper transport paths takes place depending on the phase position of the curves (4) at the time of release of the toothed segment and attachment of a roller (3) on the toothed segment lever (4) at the circumference of the cam (4). The cam (4) and the cam lever (5) are attached to a laterally arranged by this carrier disk (4a). The cam lever (5) is arranged in the deepest reactive (B) of the cam (4) and pivotally mounted on the carrier disk (4a), with its free, based on the radius of the cam laterally finend end end pressing against the cam.
