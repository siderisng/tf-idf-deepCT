<ABSTRACT>
an electrode for use in electrochemical processes  is made in the form of a valve metal substrate such as  titanium mesh, which carries a semiconductive inter­ mediate coating consisting of tin and antimony oxides,  advantageously laid down upon the valve metal substrate  in a series of layers, and an electrocatalytically-active  top coating of an oxide of manganese, applied in a series  of layers of one or more thermally-decomposable  manganese compounds or by the direct electrodeposition  of manganese oxide, the coated or electroplated substrate  subsequently being baked in an oxidizing atmosphere at  a temperature in the range of 380° to 420°c so as to  convert the one or more compounds or the electro-­ deposited oxide to an electrocatalytically-active form of  an oxide of manganese.
