<ABSTRACT>
a travelling wave stripline antenna array adapted for use  as a frequency-swept antenna, comprising a pattern of  conducting material 4,5 on an insulating substrate 2 with a  conducting backing 3, the pattern comprising a feeder strip 5  and a plurality of radiating antenna elements 4, each in the  form of a strip attached to and extending transversely away  from the feeder strip, and having an open circuit termination  at its free end.  at least some, and preferably all, of the strips  4 are formed with a longitudinal slot 6 extending from the  opposite side of the feeder strip and terminating before the  open circuit end of the strip, so that each slotted strip  behaves as a phase shifter as well as a resonant radiating  antenna element.
