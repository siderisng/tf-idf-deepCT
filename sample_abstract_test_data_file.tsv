/Users/giorgossideris/Downloads/final_clef_ip/61/EP-1084947.txt	an environmental friendly, long-lasting, practical, effective and economic method of rendering a surface antifouling properties is achieved by attaching a very thin copper-containing layer, sheet or foil directly to said surface so as to form an electrically conductive layer. these copper-containing sheets are, according to the invention, protected from oxidation by intermittently applying a cathodic protection. first, copper has been believed to prevent biological growth as a result of the leaching of copper-ions. all previous methods, based on copper, have therefore been designed to release copper-ions, which pollutes the water and causes harm to the biological life. it was thus highly surprising that, by the application of intermittent cathodic protection to the copper-containing sheets, a method which essentially and totally prevents all release of copper to the aquatic environment, the antifouling properties were still maintained. as no corrosion occurs very thin layers can be used adding further advantages to the method such as ease of application, weight and cost. secondly, it was found, surprisingly and contrary to common belief, that such very thin layers in the form of copper-containing sheets, because of their low weight, flexibility and feeble thickness, could be made to follow any shape so closely, that many commercially available water-resistant adhesives are sufficient to exclude water from penetrating in-between the surface and the copper containing sheet so that said sheets are basically held in place by the hydraulic pressure exerted on the sheet, once the structure is submerged. the new method avoids all the disadvantages of the more common use of toxic paints, as the surface will have a lower degree of roughness, be smear-free, offers long-term protection, eliminates the environmental hazards and further protects the surface from other effects of its contact with water.

/Users/giorgossideris/Downloads/final_clef_ip/61/EP-1081592.txt	interactive services with multiple interfaces are realized by employing a modular approach to their implementation. such an approach facilitates supporting natural language understanding interaction with users through use of interfaces that at least allow the user to provide information beyond what is currently being requested by the service, and/or different ordering of inputs, and/or incomplete information, and/or correction of information, and/or the return of control to prior points in the service. this is realized, in an embodiment of the invention, by employing an interactive service logic that uses "reactive constraint graphs", i. e. , a form of event-driven graph, in which nodes contain contraints on events, in conjunction with a service monitor. the service monitor manages the communication between the service logic and the multiple user interfaces. as such it provides a communication mechanism in the form of a so-called "look ahead" in which the user can input information beyond what is currently required by the interactive service. specifically, in each round of user interaction, reactive constraint graphs report to the service monitor the set of events that are currently enabled. these enable events correspond to the information the interactive service is currently requesting (or ready to accept) from a user. the user interfaces collect information (perhaps beyond this set) from the user and send it to the service monitor. the service monitor then matches the received information against the information requested by the service logic, and sends the information one event at a time to the service logic, in a priority order specified by the service provider. after each event is sent to the service logic from the service monitor, the service logic reports its new set of enabled events back to the service monitor. in turn, the service monitor sends another event that matches the enabled events to the service logic. the service monitor then notifies the user interfaces to send a new collection, i. e. , set, of information from the individual users only when no current information matches the enabled events. this approach advantageously allows a user to input information beyond what is currently needed by the interactive service.

/Users/giorgossideris/Downloads/final_clef_ip/61/EP-1081593.txt	interactive services are provided by employing a modular approach to implementing interactive services with multiple interfaces. such an approach facilitates supporting natural language understanding interaction with users through use of interfaces that allow at least different ordering of inputs, and/or incomplete information, and/or correction of information, and/or the return of control to prior points in the service. this is realized, in an embodiment of the invention, by employing a single interactive service logic that uses "reactive constraint graphs", i. e. , a form of event-driven graph, in which nodes contain a set of constraints on events. specifically, control progresses from a node to a derivative node, i. e. , "child", only when all the constraints in the set on the node have been satisfied. a single set of constraints implicitly supports a significant number of the possible different orderings of inputs. incomplete information is supported because the constraints in the set are evaluated as soon as possible. correction of information is supported because information in the constraint set is updated upon receipt of new information. indeed, use of the reactive constraint graphs allows nodes to be labeled, and allows control to revert to a prior node, i. e. , ancestor, hence allowing the user to go back to prior points in the service. new inputs can be added to the constraint sets with a complexity polynomial of the order of the input set.
