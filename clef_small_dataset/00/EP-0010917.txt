<ABSTRACT>
a method of determining foetal lung maturity by refe­ rence to the lamellar body-derived phospholipid level in  amniotic fluid surrounding a foetus.  a sample of the am­ niotic fluids is subjected to centrifugation over a cushion  material, and lamellar body material which forms a band at  the interface between the cushion material and the amino­ tic fluid during centrifugation is isolated and analysed to  determine its phospholipid level.  a phospholipid level  which is determined to be greater than about 3. 5 to 5. 0  mg/dl of amniotic fluid indicates a mature foetal lung.
