<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing structured patterns in the material of an originally smooth fabric, which became mechanically a pleating treatment underzo gene, d. H. the standing or lying permanent folding wrinkles has been provided in regular or irregular distribution. The machine-plated fabric web is continuously heated for this forfendlau Fend and the pleated wrinkles are concentrated simultaneously or subsequent to the heating either by tensioning of the fabric web or by intimately the partial impression of the pleated folds. The forming is then fixed by cooling the fabric web. The structured substance can also be partially printed partially in the structures of the strip of the fuel rail in the transfer printing method in a color and / or pattern of the base material, by a thermal print paper web (116) with the desired color or pattern during the desired pattern during the Wearing step in installation to the fabric (110) is pressed.
