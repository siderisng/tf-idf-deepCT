<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for preparing 2,3-dihydro-2-ethylbenzofurane-5-ylacetic acid by reacting essentially equimolar quantities of chloroglyoxylic acid ethylester and 2,3-dihydro-2-ethylbenzofurane in the presence of a friedel-crafts catalyst in a solvent at low temperature as well as in the further course making use of a reaction with hydrazine hydrate as reactant, characterized in that one uses for the reaction of the chloroglyoxylic acid ethylester with the 2,3-dihydro-2-ethylbenzofurane as friedel-crafts catalyst titanium tetrachloride and/or tin tetrachloride an as a solvent 1 or more lower aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons and one applies as temperature form -30 to +50 degrees c as well as one makes to react the obtained 2,3-dihydro-2-ethylbenzofurane-5-ylglyoxylic acid ethylester isolated from the reaction mixture immediately with 80 to 100 % hydrazine hydrate in the presence of 1 or more alcohols having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and/or glycoles having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms as solvent(s) to yield 2,3-dihydro-2-ethylbenzofurane-5-ylgyoxylic acid hydrazine hydrazone and one heats the latter immediately in the presence of a solution of 1 or more strong inorganic bases to a temperature of 100 to 200 degrees c.
