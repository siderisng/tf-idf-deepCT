<ABSTRACT>
in the case of a fastening element for fastening a carrier (10), provided with a slot (12) cut behind it, to a hollow beam (11) arranged transversely thereto, a sliding plate (31) with a projecting hook head (32) is arranged in the hollow beam, which can be drawn into the hollow beam (11) by means of an eccentric (41), the sliding plate (31) being displaced in the carrier (10), transversely to the longitudinal axis of the slot (12), on oblique surfaces (22, 37) which are arranged on the sliding plate (31) itself and on a base plate (21).  by this means, the hook head (32) hooks onto the wall (13, 14) at the slot (12) and at the same time draws the hollow beam (11) against the outer wall (17, 18) of the carrier (10).  a helical spring arranged between the hollow beam (11) and the sliding plate (31) ensures that the hook head (32) is pressed back into its original position again, once the eccentric (41) is released, in order to be able to draw it out of the slot (12).  <image>
