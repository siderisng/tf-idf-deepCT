<ABSTRACT>
high melt flow olefin polymers suitable for such  applications as injection molding, and the like requiring  a narrow molecular weight distribution are produced  using a catalyst made by reducing and reoxidizing a chromium  catalyst on either a titaniumsilica cogel or a self-reduced  silica-containing composition.  in the first embodiment,  a cogel formed by coprecipitating silica and titania,  and containing a chromium compound, is treated in a  non-oxidizing atmosphere, such as co, hydrogen, nâ‚‚ or  a material decomposable to these materials, and thereafter  reoxidized.  in the second embodiment, a titanium-free  chromium-containing catalyst is first heated in air or  the like to dry the catalyst and oxidize the chromium  after which it is heated in an inert atmosphere wherein the  composition is self-reduced to give chromium in a lower  valence state.  the resulting selfreduced composition is  then heated in a reducing ambient and then reoxidized as  in the first embodiment.
