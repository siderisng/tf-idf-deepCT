<ABSTRACT>
an improved medical electrode particularly adaptable  to tape-like configurations for use in sensing and stimu­ lation applications in which the electrode is applied to  the skin.  an essential electrode component comprises a  mixture of a polymerized form of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl­ propanesulfonic acid or one of its salts with water and/or  an alcohol.  the mixture possesses electrically conductive  properties, flexible properties and adhesive properties,  particularly lending itself to skin contact and adhesion.

<DESCRIPTION>
tape electrode i. description. background of prior art in its preferred embodiments this invention is directed to medical electrodes for application to the skin. skin electrodes are of varying types and may be used either as transmission electrodes or sensing electrodes. a wide variety of design configurations have been provided in the past for these kinds of electrodes. a desirable skin electrode is one which maintains good electrical contact with the skin and is free of localized current "hot spots, for example, a prior art electrode utilizing karaya gum tends to creep on use and flatten out exposing the skin to possible direct contact with the current distribution member or lead wire. it is an object of this invention to provide electrodes in which the component contacting the skin possesses superior adhesive properties. the adhesive properties are not appreciably affected by skin moisture, allowing the electrodes to be. used for several days at a. time. it is also substantially homogeneous and creep resistant and is thus able to avoid the development of "hot spots". the skin contacting component is also inherently electrically conductive, not requiring electrically conductive additives. it is a further object of this invention to provide electrodes having desirable elastic properties and wherein the skin-contacting component does not foster the growth of bacteria or other micro-organisms between the electrode and the skin. brief summary of invention accordingly, the electrodes of this invention essentially comprise electrical lead means contacting a mixture of polymerized 2-acrylamido- 2-methylpropanesulfonic acid or one of its salts with water and/or an alcohol. polymer mixtures and copolymers may also be used as described below in detail. the mixture gels and takes the form of a self-supporting flexible material having adhesive properties. additionally, it has inherent electrically conductive properties. other constituents may optionally be included in the mixture and various components such as backing supports and differing electrical lead arrangements may be used. brief description of the drawings figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of an electrode according to the invention. figure 2 is an elevational view of the electrode of figure 1. figure 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 3-3 of figure 2. detailed description of the invention as previously pointed out, this invention particularly lends itself to medical electrodes of varying shapes and configurations. for exemplary purposes herein, a skin electrode 10 is shown in one of the more common rectangular configurations. electrode 10 includes flexible, adhesive and conductive member 12 for contacting the skin. an electrical lead 14, including a conductive member 14a and an insulating sheath or covering 14b, electrically contacts member 12. in its my'sot preferred form, as shown in the fig ures, the electrode also includes an electrical current distribution member 16 which also electrically contacts electrical conductor emi3.1 member 12. in this configuration, member 12 is referred to as a substrate. current distribution member 16 is preferably formed of a metallic foil, such as stainless steel foil, which is readily available in very thin configuration or form
