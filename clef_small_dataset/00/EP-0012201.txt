<ABSTRACT>
aryl and heteroaryl mono chlorides are coupled in an  aprotic solvent under an inert atmosphere by a catalyst  mixture of a nickel compound and a ligand in the presence  of a reducing metal; catalyst composition comprising a  nickel compound, at least one ligand, magnesium or man­ ganese, and a promoter.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention pertains to a method of coupling aryl and heteroaryl mono chlorides and more particularly to the use of a catalyst mixture of an anhydrous nickel compound and a ligand in the presence of a reducing metal in a dipolar aprotic solvent. reactions which form carbon-carbon bonds are few although they are extremely useful in organic synthesis. in the formation of these bonds involving aryl groups, coupling is usually accomplished through the use of a metal. the use of copper in the ullman reaction is described in chem. rev. 38, 139 (1946); 64, 613 (1964). the use of nickel complexes was described by m. f. semmelhack, et al in j. am. chem. soc., 93, 5908 (1971). the use of palladium complexes was described by f. r. s. clark, et al, j. chem. soc. perkin i, 121 (1975). the latter reactions with nickel or palladium complexes have the advantage of proceeding at moderate temperatures but are disadvantageous in that aryl chlorides were either completely unreactive or gave very poor yields. in tetrahedron letters no. 47, pages 4089 to 4092 (1977) the homo coupling of aryl and alkenyl halides is described. actually, the examples deal only with the homo coupling of bromides and nothing is said about the possibility for coupling corresponding chlorides. in j. am. chem. soc. 1971, pages 5908 to 5910 it is described that only bromo or iodo compounds give satisfying yields when coupled in the presence of o-valent nickel compounds. by this reference, a prejudice was created to use chloro compounds in case o-valent nickel is used as catalyst in corresponding reactions. it was therefore unobvious that by carrying out corresponding coupling reactions in the presence of catalytically active compositions prepared in situ, a new process is provided which yields the final products in very high yields, sometimes in quantitative yields. these yields are higher than those described in the above mentioned publications. the process of the present invention for coupling aryl and heteroaryl mono halides having 4 to 30 carbons by which said mono halides are contacted in an aprotic solvent, with a catalytically active composition which is prepared from an anhydrous nickel compound and at least one ligand selected from a triaryl phoisphine having 6 to 14 carbons in each aryl moiety and an aromatic bidentate compound containing at least one ring nitrogen atom and 5 to 30 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof and a reducing metal selected from zinc, magnesium and manganese, at a temperature of 0 to 250°c, optionally in the presence of at least 0.1 moles per gram atom of nickel of an inorganic salt as a promotor, the catalytically active composition being formed in situ, the ratio of gram atoms of nickel to moles of aryl or heteroaryl mono halide being in the range of 0.0001 to 0.5, the amount of ligand being 0.1 to 100 moles per gram atom of nickel and the amount of reducing metal being at least 1 gram atom per mole of reacted aryl or heteroaryl
