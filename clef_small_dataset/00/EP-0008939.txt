<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed an intumescent composition.  the  applicants disclose such compositions which impart durable  flame retardancy to wood, which compositions comprise a  cyclic nitrogen compound, a hydroxy-containing organo­ phosphorus compound, and organo-phosphorus acid, and  water, wherein:   a) said cyclic nitrogen compound is    wherein a, b and c are integers selected from the group  consisting of 1 and 2, a plus b plus c equal about 3 to 6, and  x, x′, and x″ are independently selected from the group  consisting of hydrogen and -ch₃;   b) said hydroxy-containing organo-phosphorus com­ pound is selected from the group consisting of    and mixtures thereof, wherein d is an integer of from 0 to 2, e  isan integer of from 0 to 2, f is an integer of from 1 to 3, and d  plus e plus f equal 3; z is an integer of 0 to 1; x is an integer of  1 to 2, y is an integer of 1 to 2, and x plus y plus z eqal 3; r₁  r², and r³ are selected from the group consisting of alkyl  radicals containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms  and haloalkyl radicals containing from about 2 to about 6  carbon atoms, provided that when r³ is haloalkyl it contains  at least 3 carbon atoms; r⁴ and r⁵ are selected from the  group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl radicals, and haloalkyl  radicals, wherein said radicals contain from about 1 to about  6 carbon atoms; and the total number of carbon atoms in the  r¹, r², r³, r⁴, and r⁵ groups does not exceed about 14; and   c) said acid is selected from the group consisting of    and mixtures thereof, wherein r⁶, r⁷, r⁸, r⁹ are indepen­ dently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl  of from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms, haloalkyl of from  about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms, and hydroxyalkyl of from 1  to about 3 carbon atoms, provided that the total number of  carbon atoms in the r⁶, r⁷, r⁸, and r⁹ groups does not  exceed about 5; wherein q is an integer of from 1 to 2, h and i  are integers independently selected from the group consist­ ing of 0, 1, and 2, and g plus h plus i equals 3; and wherein  r¹⁰ and r¹¹ are independently selected from the group con­ sisting of alkyl of from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms,  haloalkyl of from about 1 to 6 carbons atoms and from  1 to about 3 halogen atoms, hydroxy-polyalkyleneoxy con­ taining 2 to 6 carbon atoms and 2 to 6 oxygen atoms, alkoxy  of from about 1 to 6 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkoxy of  from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, haloalkoxy of from  about 2 to about 6 atoms and from about 1 to about 3  halogen atoms,    wherein r¹² is selected from the group consisting of alkylene  of from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, haloalkylene of  from about 3 to about 6 carbon atoms and from about 1 to  about 3 halogen atoms, polyalkyleneoxy containing 2 to 6  carbon atoms and 2 to 5 oxygen atoms, and hydroxyalkylene  of from 3 to about 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 4 hydroxyls, and  r¹³ and r¹⁴ are independently selected from the group con­ sisting of hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl of from about 1 to about  6 carbon atoms, haloalkyl of from about 1 to about 6 carbon  atoms and from about 1 to about 3 halogen atoms,  hydroxy-polyalkyleneoxy containing about 2 to about 6 car­ bon atoms and 2 to 6 oxygen atoms, alkoxy of from about 1  to about 6 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkoxy of from about 2 to  about 6 carbon atoms, and haloalkoxy of from about 2 to  about 6 carbon atoms and 1 to about 3 halogen atoms, pro­ vided that the total number of carbon atoms in the r¹⁰ and  r¹¹ groups does not exceed about 8.
