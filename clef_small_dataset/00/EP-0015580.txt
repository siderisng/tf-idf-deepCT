<ABSTRACT>
a machine for punching holes (21) in sheet metal (10)  has a punch roller (3) carrying a plurality of punches (4)  and a back up roller (6) having a groove therein which has  a bottom (14) at a predetermined depth in the back up rolÂ­ ler (6).  its method of use is to run sheet metal (10) through  the nip between the two rollers (3) and (6) so that the  punches (4) punch out slugs (12) of metal so that a point  (13) on each slug (12) bears against the bottom (14) of the  groove which acts as a pivot point (13) on which the slug  (12) pivots to cause the slug (12) to be completely freed  from the parent metal (10) by the further action of the  punch (4).
