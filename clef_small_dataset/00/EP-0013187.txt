<ABSTRACT>
a bottle holder for a squeeze-type eyedropper-bottle (24)  has means (36) for holding a bottle, spacer bars (31,34) and a  nose-bridge rest (30).  the nose-bridge rest (30) is coupled to  the means (36) for holding a bottle by said spacer bars (31,34)  and is positioned thereby at a determined distance from said  means (36).  the nose-bridge rest (30) can be rested on the  bridge of a patient's nose as eyedrops are being dispensed by  the patient to locate the bottle with respect to the patient's  eye.  the nose-bridge rest (30) may be adjustable in position  with respect to the means (36) for holding the bottle (24) to  allow variable relative positioning for individual patients.

<DESCRIPTION>
eyedroppcr-bottle holder" the invention relates to an eyedropper-bottle stabilizer for administering eyedrops from an ordinary squeeze-ttpe dropper bottle. an object of the invention is the provision of a bottle holder that can be used interchangeably with bottles of the same or different sizes, and which preferably can be adjusted to suit an individual patient, alloying safe and accurate administration of drops to the eye of the patient. in the administration of eyedrops, it is important to hold the dispensing tip steady and far enough from the eye to allow the medication to drop directly onto the eyeball and to keep the tip of the dropper-bottle from touching the eye. it is important and desirable to drop the medication near the centre of the eye, and to be able to do this using only one hand. in selÂ±-aduiinistration of eyedrops, it is necessary to brace that hand against a steady object and at the same time position the dropper-bottle tip directly over the centre of the eye. it is desirable, if possible, to position the tip of the dropper-bottle directly over the centre of the eye so that the eye receiving the medication can see the drop as it forms and falls. the ordinary eyedroppers or squceze-type dropping bottles are convenient. simple to operate, and inexpensive to manufacture. however such devices suffer from the drawback of messiness and unsteadiness of the person who is administering the medication to hint elf a number of devices have been prepared to allow steady, safe, and accurate dispensing most of these devices suffer from disadvantages such as bulkiness, complicated operation, or high cost of manufacture. in addition, most of the prior art devices suffer from the aspect of being "throw-away devices.1, that is, the structure which is intended as a means of assisting the patient is an integral part of the administering container; and thus when the medication is exhausted, the relatively expensive device must be discarded along with the container. according to one aspect of the invention there is provided all adjustable eyedropper-bottle holder for use in conjunction with a squeeze-type eyedropper bottle for dispensing of eyedrops, comprising a nose-bridge rest, a spacer bar, a slide channel integral with the nose-bridge rest and the spacer bar and a slide bar to slide in close fitting relationship in the slide channel and having at one of its ends means to receive and hold an eyedropper-bottle. according to another aspect of the invention there is provided an eyedropper-bottle holder for use in conjunction with a squeeze-type eyedropper-bottle for dispensing of eyedrops, comprising an integral structure including a generally cylindrically- shaped eyedropper-bottle receptacle and a nose-bridge rest having a concave shape to engage the bridge of a patient's nose, the nosebridge rest being displaced from the eyedropper-bottle receptacle by an l-shaped spacer bar integral at one of its ends with the cylindrically shaped bottle receptacle and at the opposite one of its ends with the nose-bridge rest, the lengths of the arms of the lshaped spacer bar
