<ABSTRACT>
a cooling filter (30) for a chemical air bag inflator (44) is  made by crimping smooth wire into a squiggle pattern, cut­ ting the crimped wire into a plurality of segments, placing the  segments in a molding having the form desired for the filter, and  pressing the wire segments together in the mold.  the filter is  characterised by its ability to determine and control the ope­ rating pressure of the inflator, and enables the structuring of  an inflator for lower pressure operation with less weight and  reduced cost.

gas inflator structures, cooling filters therefor and methodsof making such filters backcl1\#o#jni) 01 tiij-'. :1 nvl'n'i1ton field of the invention this invention relates to gas inflators or generators, and particularly to chemical or solid fuel gas generators that employ cooling filters and are useful for inflating safety cushions for automotive vehicle crash restraint systems. description of the prior art various forms of cooling filters for gas generators have been proposed in the prior art including filters made of wrapped screen wire or screen wire cut into a pattern and stacked. typically, screen wire cooling filters, such as the filter disclosed in u. s. patent 3,985,076 that was granted october 12, 1976, have a depth in the direction of flow of the effluent from thirteen cms. or less to several cms. while such cooling filters have worked satisfactorily, certain limiting conditions exist that are corrected or significantly improved by the present invention. - with reference to wranped screen cooling filters as described in patent 3,985,076, the effluent flow generally is parallel to the screen surface or between alternate layers of screen. the maintenance of a constant and uniform porosity is extremely important for the achievement of uniform and reproducible gas generator or inflator operation. any step or loose section in the wrapped or stacked screens allows the effluent to pass through the filter uninterrupted with the result that the effluent going to the safety cushion or crash bag is neither cooled, nor filtered. thus, wrapped screen filters require extreme care in fabrication, require careful inspection and have a high rejection rate in production. cooling filters made with pattern cut and stacked screens generally overcome the problems associated with by-pass of the effluent resultina from flows within the filter. such filters, however, are very expensive. screen wire is relatively expensive and cutting the typical circular or doughnut pattern to make a stacked filter results in a significant waste of material. the present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems of the prior art cooling filters iiil )lovi(l additionally, advantages of increased flexibility of inflator structural design, the use of lower cost materials, and ease of control of filter density and thereby control of inflator operating pressure. su!a.#tapy of tiie invention among the objects of the invention is to provide an improved method of making a cooling filter for a chemical or solid fuel gas inflator or generator, another object of the invention is to provide a simplified structure for chemical or solid fuel gas inflators or generators. a further object of the invention is to provide an improved gas inflator or generator that can be structured for lower pressure operation with less weight and reduced cost. still another object of the invention is to provide an improved cooling filter configuration for chemical or solid fuel gas inflators or generators that ensures intimate and uniform contact with the gas stream. yet another object of the invention is to provide sur;.i# a cooling filter that can be made from wire of different materials with little or
