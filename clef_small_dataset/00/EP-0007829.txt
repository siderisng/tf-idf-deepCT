<ABSTRACT>
a counterflow evaporative heat exchanger comprises a  vertical conduit (10) in which a coil assembly (16) is  positioned.  a fluid to be cooled or condensed passes through  the coil assembly (16) while water is sprayed downwardly  over it and air is blown upwardly through it.  the coil assembly  (16) comprises a plurality of tubes (66) which at each level in  the assembly are spaced apart from each other in the horizon­ tal direction by an amount greater than the diameter of the  tubes.  this has been found to improve heat transfer in com­ parison to counterflow evaporative heat exchangers using  closely packed coil assemblies.
