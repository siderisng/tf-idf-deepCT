<ABSTRACT>
It is provided a film storage device, which is arranged between an X-ray film cassette and an X-ray film winding device. In the device, three X-ray films can be stored at the same time. Each film falls from the cassette (31) into a light-tight housing, where it comes to the clamping point of a S-shaped system of rollers and bands (8, 9) in contact. The film is then transported quickly to the end of the tape system where it is supplied via a curved plate (23) and a roller arrangement two slower rotating rollers (26, 27) which are part of the developing device. Due to the curved plate (23) and the rollers (26, 27) ensures that the X-ray film is curved accordingly and pressed together when waiting for further processing. An electrical display device on the developing device is electrically connected to a switch on the fast-running S-shaped roller system. The operation of these controls ensures that the film supply to the developing device may be required if necessary, while the first film is processed. When a third film is inserted into the system, the control devices ensure that the films are stored either in the S-shaped roller and tape arrangement or in the light-tight feed housing until the developing device can handle it.
