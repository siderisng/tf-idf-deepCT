<ABSTRACT>
a crystalline vinylidene chloride polymer powder which  is dispersible in polyols and other non-solvents for vin足 ylidene chloride polymers is prepared by aging a latex of  crystallizable vinylidene chloride polymer particles until sub足 stantially all the latex particles are crystallized and then  recovering the latex particles from the latex.  the resulting  powder can be dispersed with moderate shear in a non-足 solvent for vinylidene chloride polymers, such as a polyol  used in the preparation of polyurethane materials.  a disper足 sion of the powder and a polyol is eminently suitable for use  in the preparation of polyurethane foam material to impart  enhanced load-bearing properties and flame-retardancy  thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
crystalline vinylidene chloride polymer powder and polymeric materials containing same the present invention relates to vinylidene chloride polymers and, more particularly, to vinylidene chloride polymers which are dispersible in non-solvents for such polymers. this invention provides vinylidene chloride polymer powders that can be dispersed in a non-solvent organic liquid for vinylidene chloride polymers and thereafter used to prepare polymeric materials having enhanced physical properties. more specifically, the present invention provides a vinylidene chloride polymer powder, high in chlorine content, that can be dispersed in a polyol used to prepare polyurethane foam materials. in one aspect, this invention provides a process for preparing a crystalline vinylidene chloride polymer powder which is dispersible in non-solvent organic liquids which comprises emulsion polymerizing monomers comprising a major proportion of vinylidene chloride to prepare a latex wherein the latex particles have a diameter less than one micron, aging the resulting latex until from 75 to 100 percent of the latex particles are crystallized and then recovering the polymer from the latex. in another aspect, the present invention resides in the resultant crystalline vinylidene chloride polymer powder and a new composition of matter which comprises the resultant vinylidene chloride polymer powder dispersed in a non-solvent for vinylidene chloride polymers such as a polyol used in the preparation of polyurethane materials. crystallizable vinylidene chloride polymers in accordance with the present invention include the homopolymer and copolymers of vinylidene chloride with at least one copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated comonomer. exemplary comonomers which can be utilized in the present invention include nitriles of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids such as methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate; hydroxyalkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids such as hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, and hydroxybutyl acrylate; vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids such as vinyl acetate; amides of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylamide acid; ethylenically unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol; vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride; and other ethylenically unsaturated monomers known to polymerize with vinylidene chloride. of these, methyl acrylate is the preferred comonomer. in order to obtain a crystallizable particle, the amount of vinylidene chloride in the polymer will vary with the particular monomer used. in general, the tendency for the latex particles to crystallize while still in emulsion will increase with decreasing molecular weight, with increasing particle size, with increasing temperature during aging of the latex, or with increasing vinylidene chloride content. typically, a sharp crystallization break point at a specific comonomer concentration can be identified for each comonomer used. if the level of comonomer is increased beyond the break point, the crystallization induction time increases exponentially and the tendency for the particles in the latex to crystallize decreases exponentially. for example, at a polymer composition of 92 weight percent vinylidene chloride and 8 weight percent methyl acrylate, the tendency for latey particles having a size of about 1200 and relative viscosity of about 1.5 to crystallize is so low that the latex can be held at the
