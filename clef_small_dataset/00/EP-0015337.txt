<ABSTRACT>
a force transducer comprises a block of material  which is formed with a generally u-shaped or pi-shaped  throughaperture 24 and a generally t-shaped throughaper足 ture 26 in such a way as to form two loading members 10,  12 coupled together by first flexure elements 14, 16 which  constrain the loading members to move in a predetermined  direction under load and a second pair of flexure elements  18, 20 united by a connecting portion 22.  in use, one loa足 ding member is connected to a fixture and the other is  connected to a force receiver so that when one loading  member is displaced relative to the other in said predeter足 mined direction, the second flexure strips 18, 20 undergo a  lateral deflection which is a measure of the applied force.   this arrangement is particularly suitable for use with strain  gauges as the flexures 18, 20 are subjected to a substan足 tially uniform stress along their lengths when loaded.
