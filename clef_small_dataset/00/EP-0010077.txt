<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method for regulating the  phase position of a controlled signal in relation to the  phase position of a reference signal in a telecommunica­ tion system, and an arrangement for carrying out the  method.  the reference signal (c2) is delayed in a delay cir­ cuit (dl1) and the delayed reference signal (d1) is com­ pared with a controlled signal (c1) in a first comparison  circuit (ff1) which produces a first comparison signal (q1)  at a high or a low level in dependence on the phase differ­ ence between the delayed reference signal (d1) and the  controlled signal (c1).  the controlled signal (c1) is delayed  in a delay circuit (dl2) and the delayed controlled signal  (d2) is compared in a second comparison circuit (ff2) with  reference signal (c2).  the second comparison circuit (ff2)  produces a second comparison signal (q2) which is at a  high or a low level in dependence on the phase difference  between the signal (d2) and the reference signal (c2).  the  outputs from the comparison circuits (ff1), ff2) are con­ nected to a logic circuit (lc).  in dependence on the signal  combination received at its inputs the logic circuit pro­ duces a binary control signal which is used to correct the  phase position of the controlled signal (c1) in relation to  the phase position of the reference signal (c2).
