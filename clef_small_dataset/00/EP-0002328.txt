<ABSTRACT>
an hydraulic system as applied to a vehicle steering gear  (1) has an open centre valve (3) which directs hydraulic fluid  derived from a pump (12) and in response to a steering  manoeuvre through a shaft (4) to a servo motor of the gear  (1).  downstream of the open centre valve (3) is a restrictor (8)  which is subjected to a pressure differential on one side  through line (14) and on the opposite side to fluid pressure  derived from the downstream side of the valve (3) through  line (6).  the restrictor (8) is arranged to be at minimum  restriction to fluid flow through the line (6) to the reservoir  (11) when the valve (3) is in its neutral open centre condition.   upon pressure developing in line (14) in response to the  valve (3) being adjusted from its neutral condition, the  restrictor (8) progressively increases the restriction.
