<ABSTRACT>
the compounds of the formula <image> in which r<1>, r<2>, r<3>, x and y have the meaning indicated in the description, are obtained when succinic anhydrides are reacted with anilines in the presence of a diluent and the resulting hemiamides are cyclised in the presence of a dehydrating agent.  the active compounds according to the invention have a broad spectrum of action and can be used against parasitic fungi, which infest above-ground parts of plants or attack the plants from the soil, and against pathogens which can be transferred by seeds.  the active compounds according to the invention can be used to particularly good effect as plant protecting agents for controlling botrytis and pellicularia, and as cereal dressing agents, in particular against wheat bunt.
