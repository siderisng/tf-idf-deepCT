<ABSTRACT>
wastewater is treated by circulating it around a system  comprising a downcomer (1) and a riser (2) communicating  with each other at their lower ends, the level of the wastewa­ ter in the downcomer being above the level of the wastewater  in the riser and providing a hydrostatic pressure head (2)  which causes circulation of the wastewater around the sys­ tem, supplying a gas containing free oxygen to the wastewa­ ter as it passes through the downcomer, and pumping the  wastewater up from or from near, the top of the riser to a  part of the downcomer, at or near the top thereof, which has,  for at least a part of its length, a cross-sectional area which is  less than the cross-sectional area of the remainder of the  downcomer below the said part.
