<ABSTRACT>
double sectioned tank for ship's ballast and cargo that  can be bult into or placed in the cargo space of a ship (10) to  contain ballast water or another liquid without cross-contamination  with the cargo residues, i. e.  allowing for the  carriage of segregated ballast in the cargo space.  allowance  is also made for double-bottom space (12) in the ship's  loaded condition.  a large part (16) of the top, or lid, or the  special tank is movable in a vertical direction from the highest  part of the tank to the lowest part of the tank and special  machinery and safety devices are fitted to expedite this  movement.  a rubber or flexible fabric√† sheet (18), which is  watertight, connects the moveable (16) and stationary part  (66) of the tank top and divides the tank into an upper (14)  and a lower section (12) between which there is no communication.   the flexible sheet (18) is designed to take the  internal contours of the inner tank when the cargo is loaded.
