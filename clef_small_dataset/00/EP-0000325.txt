<ABSTRACT>
1.  mounting for a tongue (12), carrying a coupling head (10), of a trailer coupling to be attached particularly to heavy-goods vehicles, with a bearing box (16), which surrounds the tongue (12) with a radial spacing and which is located immovably on the heavy-goods vehicle, and in which the tongue (12) is guided, via bearing rings (28) lying in contact with the inside of the bearing box (16), rotatably about its axis, displaceably in an axial direction against spring pressure and immovably in a radial direction, the bearing box (16) having at its ends bearing faces (24), which extend conically outwards axially, for conical faces (26) made complementary to these on the outer periphery of the bearing rings (28), the bearing rings (28) being tensioned, by axially acting spring means (50, 52), against the bearing faces (24) of the bearing box (16) and being elastically deformable under the axial prestress, in such a way that these bearing rings substantially prevent a radial play between the tongue (12) and bearing box (16), characterised in that the bearing rings (28) made of plastic are each provided, on their end face (36), substantially normal to their axis, intended for bearing on a pressure face (58, 64) of the spring means (50, 52), with a packing ring (34), which is designed as a marginal bead (34) elevated above the end face (36).
