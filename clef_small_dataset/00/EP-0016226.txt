<ABSTRACT>
a synthetic acrylic resin plate and production thereof,  said resin plate being laminated with acrylic films and having  a wrinkle-free, glossy surface which is improved in printability.   in more details, said acrylic resin films (f) are partially  swelled and dissolved by acrylic monomer contained in  synthetic resin supplied through a syrup feeder (6) onto a belt  (1'), before the synthetic resin is hardened by polymerization,  and then said films (f) are firmly integrated to the acrylic  synthetic resin plate while said acrylic monomer makes  polymerization (18,9).

<DESCRIPTION>
acryl1c synthetic resin sheet technical field this invention relates to an acrylic synthetic resin sheet on which an acrylic film is integrally laminated. more particularly, this invention relates to an acrylic synthetic resin sheet on which an acrylic film is laminated, characterized in that said acrylic film is partially swollen and dissolved with monomer which is to be polymerized and hardened into the acrylic synthetic resin sheet and the film becomes integral with the sheet when the monomer is polymerized and hardened. background art hitherto, patterns or colors have been printed on acrylic synthetic resin sheets by screen printing, painting or offset printing, but these printing operations are complicated and require many workers and moreover printing patterns or colors on a large-sized sheet was nearly impossible by these methods. it is also known to heat-bond an acrylic film on which patterns or colors are printed to an acrylic synthetic resin sheet. in this case, too, a great number of workers are needed and moreover it is also difficult to print patterns or colors on sheets of large size. a prior art, british patent 1,274,516 discloses production of solid resin articles by pouring a liquid prepolymer in a mold wherein a synthetic resin film is applied to the inner surface of the mold prior to pouring oi said liquid prepolymer, then the liquid prepolymer is poured in the mold and this is heated to produce a solid resin article, a resin film compatible with the prepolymer being used as said synthetic resin film. furthermore, said british patent discloses in its examples that methyl methacrylate is used as the liquid prepolymer and polyvinyl chloride is used as the synthetic resin film and that in the case of the final resin being an acrylate resin polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride or polycarbonates are preferred as the compatible film. however, in case the final resin is an acrylate resin, use of the films as mentioned above results in wrinkles during production to damage the commercial value. the present invention is directed toward solution of these defects. disclosure of invention said improvement has been attained by an acrylic synthetic resin sheet on which an acrylic film is integrally laminated, characterized in that said acrylic film is partially swollen and dissolved with monomer for acrylic synthetic resin before being polymerized and hardened into a sheet and becomes integral with the polymerized and hardened acrylic synthetic resin sheet. methyl methacrylate resin sheets can be used as the acrylic synthetic resin sheet in this invention and synthetic resin sheets which comprise copolymers c f at least 90% by weight of methyl methacrylate and other copolymerizable monoethylenically unsaturated compounds and/or polyfunctional compounds may also be used. suitable monoethylenically unsaturated compounds are methacrylic esters, acrylic esters, styrene, or the like. suitable polyfunctional compounds are methacrylic esters such as glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl methacrylate, or the like, diallyl phthalate, diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate and mixtures thereof. alkyl methacry'ate films are preferred as the acrylic film and examples thereof are those which are produced
