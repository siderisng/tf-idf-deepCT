<ABSTRACT>
a method for recording and retrieving document infor­ mation on a recording medium, the information representa­ tive of each separate document being in the format of a video  signal comprising two sequential interlaced fields.  to record  the document information the video signals (f₁, f₂) corres­ ponding to the two fields are used to amplitude modulate  quadrature components of a single carrier frequency (12).  the  modulated components are vectorially added and the resul­ tant "qam" signal (21) is then angularly modulated on a high  frequency carrier signal (23) to produce a signal (26) which is  recorded on a rotating disc storage device.  to retrieve the  recorded information the disc is rotated and the recorded  signal is demodulated upon successive revolutions of the disc  to produce a field sequential signal comprising, in alternation,  the two fields of information.  the signals representative of the  two fields of information are then applied to a video monitor  or alternatively, electronically processed and applied to either  a line-sequential printer or a dual-line printer.
