<ABSTRACT>
a cyclic redundancy check word is customarily placed at  the end of a data block, occupying one or more of the last  bytes of the block.  this can impose an undesirable restraint  upon the person composing the data block, e. g.  the editor of  a teletext page.  the invention allows the check word effec­ tively to be embedded anywhere convenient in the block.  a  location in the block is selected (one or more bytes - preset  address 16) and all preceding bytes and cyclically encoded  (encoder 18) to yield a first check word.  the succeeding bytes  are subjected in reverse order to complementary encoding  (encoder 28) to yield a second check word.  a third check  word is formed from the first and second check words  (encoding logic 32) and inserted in the selected location.   each bit of the third word is the logical product of the corres­ ponding bit of the first word and selected bits of the second  word, such that when the bytes of the complete block, includ­ ing the third word, are cyclically encoded, the final check  word has the required final form e. g.  all zeroes, to indicate  compliance of the block with the cyclic redundancy check.   the location can be selected by the editor but is preferably  selected automatically by a search for a free location comply­ ing with predetermined conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
cyclic redundancy data check encoding method and apparatus the use of cyclic redundancy check codes, referred to more briefly herein as check words, is well known as a means of protecting blocks of binary data when errors in one or more received bits cannot be tolerated. the check words can be used in ways well known in themselves, and forming no part of this invention, to correct some errors and detect other errors (which require re-transmission of the data block). an encoder is used to generate the check word for a block and this check word is transmitted along with the block. at the receiver the same encoding operation is performed on the received block plus check word and the result is a final check word which has a predetermined form, e.g. all zeroes if tbe block has been received without error. one example of the use of this technique is in teletext data transmission. in the standards currently adopted in the united kingdom a data block is a page consisting of 24 lines numbered 0 to 23, each comprising 40 8-bit characters. the data block which is encoded may be restricted to lines 1 to 23 or to these lines plus part only of line 0 since line 0 is the "page header" which can contain rapidly changing tine information. (see broadcast teletext specification, september 1976 published jointly by british broadcasting corporation and others.) to take the case of just lines 1 to 23 there are 23 x 40 8-bit words, i.e. 920 words, for which a 16-bit check word suffices. this check word is inserted in the data block itself as two data words, i.e. two characters, at the end of line 23. the requirement always to assign these two characters to the check word can be a troublesome constraint on the editor setting up a page and the object of this invention is to provide an apparatus and method which enables the check word to be effectively embedded anywhere in the data block. the editor can then place the check word where it will not matter so far as the ultimate use of the data block is concerned. the apparatus and method according to the invention are defined in claims i and 2. the invention will be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: the sole figure is a block diagram of an encoder embodying the invention. in the figure all connections are shown simply as single lines. obviously many of these lines represent bit-parallel, multiple lines. the apparatus shown in the figure comprises a page store 10 in which 24 lines of 40 8-bit characters (each including a parity bit) are stored. the editor has conventional means comprising at least a keyboard for entering data as indicated by the line 12 labelled data entry. the store is coupled to a conventional visual display unit (vdu) 14 which is used by the editor to monitor what he is

<CLAIMS>
 claims ¯   1. cyclic redundancy check data encoding apparatus comprising a multi-byte store for storing a block of data, means for designating, a selected part of the stored block, an encoder for encoding the bytes preceding the said selected part designated by the designating means, to provide a first check word in a register of the encoder, a complementary encoder for encoding, in reverse order, the bytes succeeding the said selected part designated by the designating means, to provide a second check word in a register of the complementary encoder, encoding logic responsive to the first and second check words in the registers to generate a third check word, and means arranged to enter the third check word in the store to occupy the selected part of the block of data designated by the designating means.   2. a method of processing a multi-byte block of data to render the block consistent with a given cyclic redundancy check, wherein the bytes preceding a predetermined part of the block are cyclically encoded to generate a first check word, the bytes succeeding the said part of the block are subjected in reverse order to complementary encoding to generate a second check word, and a third check word is generated from the first and second check words and introduced into the said part of the block, the bits of the third word being predetermined logical functions of bits of the first and second words such that when the whole block, including the introduced third word, is cyclically encoded, the final check word thereby generated has a predetermined form.    3. a method according to claim 2, wherein the said part of the block is predetermined by automatic scanning of the block to select a free location for the introduced check word.
