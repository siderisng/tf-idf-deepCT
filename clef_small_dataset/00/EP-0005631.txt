<ABSTRACT>
a tube hanger for a cable conveying system including a  pair of substantially identical sheet metal members wherein  each of the members includes a hook portion, a tube  engaging portion and a suspension portion with an opening  being disposed in the suspension portion.  the hook portions  are connected together and the openings are in alignment  for reception of an s-shaped hook for connecting the tube  hanger to a supporting member and for holding the members  together in a tube supporting position.  the sheet metal  members have an inside contour which is identical to the  outside contour whereby such members can be stamped  from a single sheet of metal without wasting material  between members being formed.
