<ABSTRACT>
apparatus is described for producing hard copy prints of  images displayed on a raster-scanned crt terminal.  a row of  light-fibres 4 are attached to a preselected scan line of the  crt 3 located behind the crt bezel 5.  the other ends of the  row of light fibres 4 are located along the surface of a print  roller 8 on which light sensitive paper 6 is supported.  a light  pattern produced as a result of an image scan along the  preselected scan line is transmitted by the light fibres 4 to the  paper 6 which is exposed to form a latent image of the light  pattern in a print row on the paper.  in order to print a complete  image, the paper is drawn past the print row and  exposed successively to each raster scan row of the image to  be printed.  the exposed paper is then passed through a  developing station 10 where the latent image is developed  by heat.  two modes of operation are described.  in one mode  the image display is interrupted during the print cycle, in the  other mode both display and printing are performed concurrently.
