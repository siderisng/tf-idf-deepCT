<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacture of a substantially iso­ merically pure acylanilide of the structure    where r is hydrogen, lower alkyl, hydroxy-lower alkyl or  lower alkoxy-lower alkyl; r₁ is lower-alkyl, phenyl, lower-­ alkylphenyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxyphenyl,  chlorophenyl, nitrophenyl, dichlorophenyl, choro-lower  alkyl, cyano-lower alkyl, lower alkyl, amino, sulfamoyl­ phenyl, carbamoylphenyl or lower alkoxy-lower alkyl; and x  is -co- or -so₂-; comprising the step of treating an alcohol  solution of a diamino compound of the structure    with an acylating agent, to give an alcohol solution of the  acylanilide, wherein substantially equivalent amounts of the  acylating agent and the diamino compound are used and  therein the treatment is carried out by the slow, drop-wise  addition of the acylating agent at a temperature in the range  of about 0 to 5° c.  the process is particularly advantageous  when the alcohol solution of the diamino compound is  produced by reduction of a suspension of the correspon­ ding dinitro compound in the alcohol.
