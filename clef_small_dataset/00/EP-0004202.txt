<ABSTRACT>
a tire building machine comprises a number of modular  packages which can be used interchangeably in single stage,  second stage, or first stage tire component assembly.  some  of the modular components are particularly useful in the  manufacture of larger or truck type tires but can also be used  in the automatic or semi-automatic production of smaller  passenger size tires.  one of the principal modular components  is a carriage mounted device for transfer of components  such as bands or belt and tread assemblies, or finished  tires, which also functions as a bead setter and as a retractable  two-position idle journal support for the non-driven end  of the main shaft of the tire building drum or shaper.  the  shaft supports a wide variety of shapers or drums for single,  first or second stage building.  the device is mounted for  movement to and from the shaper or drum and includes a  support arm which moves in a circular arc to assume and  maintain various positions during various periods in the  machine cycle.  for certain types of shapers, the device provides  support and means for automatic removal and  replacement of the outboard bead seal flange.  a bead setter  is supported on the device and is adjustable omnidirectionally  to obtain concentricity and squareness and is also  adjustable axially for accurate bead placement symmetrically  about the axis centerline of the shaper or drum and thus  the tire being built.  a bead gripper, actuated by fluid power,  automatically rotates clear of the bead flippers or apex and  clamps the tire bead securely and squarely to ensure accurate  bead placement while transferring the tire bead to its  selected location.  a retractable positive intermediate stop is  employed to position the carriage of the device to perform its  various functions.  a wide variety of arrangements of the  components may be employed performing various tire building  processes for different types and sizes of tires.
