<ABSTRACT>
device for separating oil from a refrigerant comprising a  separator (1) and a heat exchanger (2), said separator (1)  having an inlet (3) passing through the heat exchanger (2) for  refrigerant including oil from a compressor, and an outlet (13)  for the separated oil to be returned to the compressor,  whereby the separator comprises a primary and a secondary  section, the primary section being located above the secon­ dary section and the oil-rich mixture of refrigerant and oil  formed in the primary section being passed through the outlet  (13) to the heat exchanger (2), where the refrigerant is evapo­ rated by the heat of the refrigerant and oil passing through the  inlet (3) and whereby liquid refrigerant is continuously dis­ charged from the separator (1) through a line (8) and is  returned to the inlet (3) on a constant amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
a device for separating oil from a refrigerant. the present invention relates to a device for separating oil from a refrigerant comprising a separator and a heat exchanger, in which separator the oil is separated from the gaseous refrigerant by gravity, partial condensation and dissolution in the liquid refrigerant, said separator having an inlet for refrigerant including oil from the compressor, an outlet for the gaseous refrigerant freed from oil to be passed to the condenser and an outlet for the separated oil to be returned to the compressor, and through which heat exchanger an oil-rich mixture of refrigerant and oil is passed in order to evaporate the refrigerant therefrom before returning the oil to the compressor, the heat of evaporation being supplied by the refrigerant passed to the separator upon discharge from the compressor. a similar device is known from the german patent specification nr. 834,854. it is of common knowledge that for a good operation of the compressor in a refrigeration system oil should be supplied to the compressor. together with the refrigerant, generally ammonia, part of this oil is carried to all other parts of the refrigeration system, such as the condenser and the evaporator,in which the presence of this oil is however undesirable because the heat transfer is affected unfavorably thereby. in the device for the removal of oil known from the german patent specification nr. 834,854 the gaseous refrigerant discharged from the low pressure stage of the compressor, thus including much oil is passed to the separator, that is to say to apart thereof in which a pool of liquid refrigerant is present. hence the heavily oil-laden gaseous refrigerant is washed and cooled in the bath of liquid.in the separator there occurs a settling of the oil and above the liquid in the separator an accumulation of gaseous refrigerant to be returned to the high pressure stage of the compressor. the separated oil yet contains quite some refrigerant and this refrigerant is separated from the oil by periodical evaporation in the said heat exchanger. the object of the invention is to provide a device exibitlng a yet better oil separation so that the gaseous refrigerant passed to the condenser is essentially free from oil while the oil content of the purified compressed gas amounts to less than 1 ppm. according to the invention this is attained in that the separator comprises a primary separating section and a secondary separating section, said primary separating section being located above said secondary separating 3section, the oil-rich mixture of refrigerant and oil formed in the primary section being passed to the heat exchanger for evaporation and the retrigerant being passed to the secondary separating section and subsequently to the condenser and the liquid refrigerant being continuously discharged from the primary and the secondary separating section and being returned in a constant amour, to said inlet of the separator. hence several measures are taken in order to attain the above object. in accordance with the first measure use is made
