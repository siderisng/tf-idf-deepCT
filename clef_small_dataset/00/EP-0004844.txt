<ABSTRACT>
a method for manufacturing a plastic product comprising  the steps of placing a wax model in a flask, pouring  plaster into the flask, heating the flask to melt the wax model,  flowing out the melted wax, injecting plastic material and  taking out a plastic product when the plastic material has  become solid.  this method is particularly advantageous in  manufacturing an industrial proto-type model, artificial  teeth, and the like which have to be made precisely and  economically.  an apparatus for carrying out the method is  also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for manufacturing plastic products background of the invention 1. field of the invention this invention relates to a method and apparatus for manufacturing a plastic product, such as industrial prototype models and false teeth. 2. prior art in general, a plastic product to be prepared individually such as an industrial proto-type model and a piece of artificial teeth has been manufactured by means of a metal molding. more specifically upper and lower moldings conforming to the shape of the product to be manufactured have to be prepared.. these moldings are pressed together to yield a desired hsape to the plastic material injected therebetween. however, these tnoldings are limited in terms of their expensiveness, impreciseness, or difficulty of modification. for example, metal-moldings are known to be very expensive; and both of them are not easy to modify the shape once they are shaped. therefore, simple and precise substitute for such prior art molding has been wanted for a long time. summary of the invention accordingly, it is the primary object of this invention to provide a method for manufacturing plastic product economically and precisely. it is another object of this invention to provide a method for manufacturing a plastic product by using a wax model which allows any modification on the shape very easily. it is still another object of this invention to provide an apparatus which is specifically designed to be used in the method of this invention. it is still another object of this.invention to provide an apparatus having a temperature controlling equipment which substantially saves the time to be involved in.the manufacturing process. -- - - the method and apparatus of this invention may be used for a variety of purposes including industrial proto-type models, artificial teeth, table wares, trays and the like. in keeping with the principles of this invention, the objects are accomplished by a unique process comprising the step of placing a model made of wax in a flask, pouring plaster into the flask, heating the model after the plaster having coagulated until the model is melted, removing the melted wax out of the flask, injecting plastic material into the .space formed by the removal of the melted wax, cooling off the plastic material until it becomes solid. brief description of the drawings figure 1 shows a persepctive view of a plastic product to be manufactured by this invention; figure 2 shows a perspective view of a flask of an embodiment of the apparatus of this invention; figure 3 shows a cross-section view of a lower portion. of the flask of the embodiment with a wax model mounted therein figure 4 through 7 show a vertical cross-sectional view of the apparatus for the illustration of the process of this invention; figure 8 shows a plan view of a lower portion of a flask with a wax model mounted therein of a second embodiment o this invention; figure 9 shows a perspective view of the apparatus put all together of the second embodiment;
