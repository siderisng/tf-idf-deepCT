<ABSTRACT>
Methods and arrangements for converting color video signals into a special color auxiliary carrier signal decoration in PAL color television receivers.The PAL or NTSC standard color television signals are reacted into a via support channel, in particular for the recorded / reproduction of a magnetic recording medium (TP), and then in a special color auxiliary carrier signal decodable in PAL color television receivers without a delay line, which a specialFrequency (FT) and a fixed phase angle of in particular 45 Â° Owtt and the a predetermined by specific combination of the color difference signals (U and V) has amplitude.Convenient arrangements, in particular with double-symmetrical modulators (D1, D2), allow different generation possibilities of the special color auxiliary carrier signal.
