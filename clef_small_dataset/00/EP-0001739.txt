<ABSTRACT>
the mixtures comprise a) 10-95% by weight (based on a + b + c) of a mixture of polyhydric alcohols, hydroxyaldehydes and hydroxyketones obtained by condensation of formaldehyde hydrate, b) 5-80% by weight (based on a + b + c) of monomers which are capable of forming aminoplastics, or n-methylolation products thereof, and  c) 0-80% by weight (based on a + b + c) of water.  the mixtures are obtained by condensation of formaldehyde in the presence of said monomers and are used to prepare polyurethanes and aminoplastics.
