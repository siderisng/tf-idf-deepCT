<ABSTRACT>
an amusement device for use by children both for enter­ tainment as well as a coordination aid.  the device comprises a  plurality of thin essentially similar segments (10), each seg­ ment pivotally engaging adjacent segments in snap-in rela­ tion (12).  the pivotal engagement enables rotation of one  segment (10) with respect to an adjacently engaged segment  (10) through a predetermined angle.  locking means are  formed into the segments (10), preventing translation of one  segment (10) with respect to another when such segments  (10) are engaged.  when connected in the form of an open belt,  the device may be manipulated in various entertaining man­ ners, and upon articulation, the impact of adjacent segments  (10) produces a slapping sound for additional amusement.   when the free ends of the belt arrangement are engaged to  form a closed loop, two segment stacks (16, 18) are created.   back-and-forth manipulation of each segment stack causes  individual segments (10) to move from one stack (16,.  18) to  the other.  additionally, by providing indicia such as pictures,  performations, and patterns on each segment face, a chang­ ing visual display is obtained as the segments (10) are articu­ lated from one stack (16, 18) to the other.
