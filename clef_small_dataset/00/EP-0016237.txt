<ABSTRACT>
a twist roller guide device includes a guide box (5), a twist  guide member (1) having a twisted guide bore (10) for preÂ­ liminarily twisting the stock (w), and a roller holder (14),  supporting a pair of twist rollers (34).  for minimizing the  overall length of the guide the roller holder (14) consists of a  hollow cylindrical body portion and two bearing plates (33)  extending forwardly therefrom to support said twist rollers  (34) therebetween.  the twist guide member (1) consists of a  tubular body portion (1b) and an enlarged inlet head portion  (1a) being fitted in a bracket portion of the guide box (5) at the  rear end thereof.  the body portion (1b) of the twist guide  a member (1) is fitted in the body portion of the roller holder  (14), which is firmly supported in a support bracket (65) of the  guide box (5) at the front end thereof.  the twist guide member  (1) is beveled at its exit end (12) face for being placed close to  the twist rollers (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
twist roller auide device for rolling mill use the present invention relates generally to rolling apparatus including a plurality of rolling mills arranged in series for progressive rolling of wire rods, steel sections, steel bars cr the like stock materials. in such rolling mill arrangement, twist roller guide devices are employed in a continuous rolling operation in which the stock being rolled is properly twisted between each two adjacent rolling mills from its state as extended out'of the preceding mill so as to run into the following mill in a state raised in transverse cross section vertically or, as with the case of a stock of rectangular cross section, at an angle of inclination of 45 degrees and the guide devices are each arranged adjacent to the exit of the preceding rolling mill to receive the stock as extended therefrom and impart-to the stock an angle of twist required. the present invention relates particulakly to twist roller guide devices of the kind described. generally, in the continuous rolling operation of a set of horizontal rolling mills, it is requisite that the stock bar extended from between the working rolls of the preceding rolling mill (which will be referred to hereinafter as the first rolling mill) and having a longitudinal axis of cross section that is norizontal is twisted in order that it may be introduced into the roll nip of the second or following rolling mill with the cross-sectional axis raised to the vertical or at an angle of 45 degrees. an advanced form of twist a roller guide device for rolling mill use includes a pair of adjustable top and bottom twist rollers which receives the stock 2s extended from the first rolling mill and having the longitudinal axis of cross section horizontally directed and gives to the stock a definite angle of twist to place the cross-sectional- axis at a predetermined angle of inclination to the horizontal. in operation, the steel bar or other stock received in the twist roller guide continues to advance while turning gradually in accordance with the exact angle of twist given by the paired twist rollers of the guide device and reaches the roll groove of the second rolling mill, assuming a state raised as described above at the roll nip point. with such guide devices arranged between the successive rolling mills, the stock is rolled progressively, entering each of the rolling mills stably in a definite cross-sectional attitude. this makes it possible at all times to obtain a desired high quality product having an exact reduced cross-sectional shape and area. such technique of twisting a stock being rolled into a raised state of cross section by use of a pair of twist rollers is generally considered highly reliable but involves some problems as described below. in the twist roller guide device, the paired twist rollers are set an angle corresponding to the predetermined angle of twist to be given to the stock andi because of this, if the stock as extended out

claims:   1. a twist roller guide device to be arranged between each  two adjacent rolling mills in a set of aligned rolling  mills and of the type including a pair of upper and  lower twist rollers and a twist guide member having  a guide bore formed therein with two diametrally oppo  site helically extending wall surfaces effective to  preliminarily twist the stock as the latter proceeds  through the guide bore,   said device  being characterized in that  said pair of twist rollers (34) are journaled on re  spective bearing plates (33) provided on a hollow cy  lindrical roller holder (14) mounted on a guide box  -(5) and that the tubular body of said twist guide mem  ber (1) is fitted in said guide box (5) with a body  portion of said twist guide member (1) adjacent to the  exit end (12) thereof directly fitted in the cylindri  cal hole of said roller holder (14) so that the exit  of said twist guide member (1) is held in closely spaced  opposite relation to said pair of twist rollers (34).   2. a device as claimed in claim 1, in which the exit end  (12) face of the tubular body of said twist guide mem  ber (1) is beveled at the top and bottom thereof to  enable the exit of said guide bore (10) to be held  opposite to said pair of twist rollers (34) at a mini  mum distance therefrom.
