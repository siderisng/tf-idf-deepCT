<ABSTRACT>
imides derived from 2-oxo-3-benzothiazolineacetic  acid and butyric acid have been found to be effective as  herbicides and plant growth regulants.  these imides are compounds represented by the forÂ­ mula    wherein r is lower alkyl, t is hydrogen, halogen, nitro or  lower alkyl, and n is either one or three.  these imides are produced by reacting an appropriate  imide with an anhydride in the presence of a catalytic  amount of an alkali metal salt.
