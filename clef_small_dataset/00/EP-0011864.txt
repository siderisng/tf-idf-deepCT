<ABSTRACT>
feline infectious peritonitis is a disease of members of  the genus felix which is almost invariably fatal, and for which  there is currently no vaccine available.  indeed many attempts  to isolate and grow the virus have failed.  by passaging a  virulent isolate of feline infectious peritonitis (fip) virus in  feline embryonic cell cultures about 100 times an attenuated  strain of fip virus can be produced which stimulates the pro­ duction of antibody in susceptible animals without causing  overt disease.  such an attenuated strain can be formulated  into a vaccine for administrative purposes.
