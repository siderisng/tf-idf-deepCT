<ABSTRACT>
a non-aqueous acaricidal composition comprises benzyl  benzoate together with from 5% to 100% of a fatty acid ester  miscible with the benzyl benzoate but substantially insoluble  in water.  suitable fatty acid esters include glyceryl monos­ tearate and isopropyl myristate.  the fatty acid ester slows  down evaporation of the benzyl benzoate and also syner­ gises its acaricidal action.

<DESCRIPTION>
acaricidalcompositions this invention relates to acaricidal compositions, and to the use of such compositions in the treatment of bedding and other materials. house dust allergies take various forms, including principally asthma, but also skin and eye infections. it has been established by numerous suchors that house dust allergy in a high proportion of cases is caused by the dermatophagoides family of acarine mites and that a beneficial effect cen be expected from the eradication of the mites followed by a prevention of their recurrence. it is well known that the various species of mite, the dermatophagoides family, species culinne, pteronyssinus, the house mite glycyphagus domesticus and the flour mite acarus ciro are relatively non-susceptible to normal insecticides such as pyrethrins and d.d.t. they are, however, known to be highly susceptible to certain acaricides such as benzyl benzoate which is widely used in the treatment of scabies and other such infestations. for this purpose, benzyl benzoate has conventionally been emulsified in water, in wich it is insoluble, and the emulsion applied liberally to the patient's skin. the mites in question live and breed largely in bedding materials e.g. sheets, mattresses and blankets, and also house dust, floor coverings, fabric-covered furniture. they are also widely found in birds pasts and therefore in feather materials and the skins of birds and manuals, which they also re-infect after those materials have been made up into products. it would be useful to treat such bedding and other materials so as either to kill mites coining in contact tçitl them, or at least to prevent the mites from breeding there. one difficulty in such treatment arises from the fact that benzyl benzoate, though it does not boil until about 320 c, does have an appreciable vapour pressure at am beint temperatures. this vapour pressure is increased at tlle higher temperature taken up by the bedding when the bed is occupied. this also applies to skins and fabric materials etc in warn climates. as a result, benzyl benzoate only gives temporary protection from mites, since in the course of time it evaporates away and is lost. compositions in which the rate of evaporation cf benzyl benzoate is retarded are described in british patent specification no. 1,368,657, and include, in addition t the benzyl benzoate, a non-volatile poly- alkylene glycol or a non-volatile etber or esther thereof. polyethylene glycols having molecular weights dove 2000 were preferred because they melt above body temper- ature and are non-sticky and non-hygroscopic. it was thought important to avoid using liquid carriers since these would make the bedding feel damp. suc composiions however have various disadvantages:- a) the polyalkylene glycols a-:e water-soluble and are therefore susceptible to moisture, e.g. from perspir- ation in bed. this may cause the glycol derivate, with or without the benzyl benzoate, to migrate, either away from the sleeping patient e.g. downwards into the mattress, or into contact with the patient's clothes and skin. b) since polyalkylene glycols are well known per cutaneous transportation agents, the benzyl benzoate that
