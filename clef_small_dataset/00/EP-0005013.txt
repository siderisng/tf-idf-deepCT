<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to dental constructions such as  bridges, crowns and the like which utilize a novel dental alloy  as a metal core and porcelain or other tooth simulating  material bonded thereto.  the dental alloys are composed  primarily of nickel, and chromium and contain on a weight  percent basis, about 65 to 80 per cent nickel, about 12. 0 to  20. 0 per cent chromium, and in addition about 3. 5 to 5. 0 per  cent silicon, about 3. 0 to 6. 0 per cent molybdenum, and  about 0. 2 to 0. 6 per cent boron.  more preferably the alloys  consist essentially of 71 to 74. 3 per cent nickel, 17. 5 to 19. 5  per cent chromium, 3. 9 to 4. 5 per cent silicon, about 3. 9 to 4. 5  per cent molybdenum and 0. 3 to 0. 5 per cent boron.  the  alloys have excellent physical properties for dental applications  having a fusion temperature with the range of about  2300 to 2450°f (1260°c to 1343°c), a coefficient of expansion  of from about 13. 6 x 10⁻⁶ in/in/°c (13. 6 x 10⁻⁶ °c⁻¹ to about  14. 5 x 10⁻⁶ in/in/°c (14. 5 x 10⁻⁶ °c⁻¹), good corrosion  resistance when compared with similarly cast gold or other  commercial non-precious metal dental alloys and good  oxidation resistance.  they also have as cast, a tensile  strength of at least 80,000 p. s. i. , an elongation of about 2. 0 to  5. 0 per cent, a rockwell b hardness within the range of about  90 to 100, and good bonding to porcelain.

<DESCRIPTION>
"dental constructions atin dental alloys" the invention relates to dental constructions such as bridges, crowns and the like comprising a metal core and porcelain or other tooth simulating material bonded thereto, and to dental alloys having good physical strength, corrosion resistance, workability and ability to bond to porcelain. the dental alloys have a base cost of substantially less than gold but are equal to or better than gold for many dental applications. the alloys are also useful in dental applications not requiring bonding to porcelain or plastics material in the preparation of metal inlays or oniays. the metal cores of the dental construction are alloys composed primarily of nickel and chromium and containing cn a weight percent basis, about 65 to 80 per cent nickel, about 12.0 to 20.0 per cent chromium, and, in addition, about 3.5 to 5.0 per cent silicons about 3.0 to 6.0 per cent molybdenum, and about 0.2 to 0.6 per cent boron. the alloys have excellent physical properties for dental applications having a fusion temperature with the range of about 2300 to 2450 f, (12600c to 13430c), a coefficient to expansion of from about 13.6 x 10 6 in/in/ c (13.6 x 10 1) to about 14.5 x 10 6 in/in/0c (14.5 x 10 60c 1) good corrosion resistance when compared with similarly cast gold or other commercial non-precious metal dental alloys and good oxidation resistance. they also have as cast, a tensile strength of at least b0,000 p.s.i. (552 mn/m2), gn elongation of about 2.0 to 5.0 per cent, a rockwell hardness within the range of about 90 to 10d, and good bonding to porcelain. the alloy of the invention has improved polishability as compared to the prior art non-precious metal alloys containing the same elements in different amounts. that is, the alloys polish almost as easily as gold alloys, yet the known advantages of non-precious metal alloys are retained. dental restorations such as bridges, crowns, dentures, partial'dentures, inlays, onlays and the like have employed gold alloys for many years. because of its high cost, many attempts have been made to make and employ non-precious metal alloys in place of the gold. such non-precious metal alloy compositions are illustrated, for example by the u.s. patents nos. 1,736,053; 2,089,587; 2,156,757; 2,134,423; 2,162,252; 2,631,095; 3,121,629; 3,464,817 and 3,544,315. gold alloys, however, have many advantageous properties as a dental alloy and many of the previously prepared non-precious metal alloys have been found to be unsatisfactory in various respects when compared to the conventional gold alloy. a dental alloy is disclosed in u.s. patent no. 4,038,752 which is similar to the alloys of the invention. there is a difference in that the u.s. patent claims the use of copper, iron and manganese all of which could contribute to discoloration of the porcelain. furthermore, at the upper limits of silicon claimed therein an alloy is provided which is too brittle and which would not have the improved polishability of the instant novel alloys. in fact, there is no teaching
