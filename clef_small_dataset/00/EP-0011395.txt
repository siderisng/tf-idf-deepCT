<ABSTRACT>
a member, particularly a reel of a fruit machine, is rotatÂ­ able through a number of predetermined stopping positions.   the member is rotated with an electric motor and can be  stopped in registration with any one of the stopping positions  by means of an indexing device, comprising, for example, a  finger (10) of pawl (33) which is engageable with teeth (7 or 32)  around the periphery of the member.  the electric motor is integrated with the member.  for  example, the member may comprise a metal disc (6) which  forms the rotor of a rotary linear motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
rotatably mounted member this invention relates to a member which is mounted on a support structure so as to be rotatable relative thereto through a plurality of predetermined stopping positions. the invention is more particularly although not exclusively, concerned with such a rotatably mounted member which is a reel assembly of a gaming-type entertainment machine of the kind known as a fruit machine, that is a rotatably mounted member in which the member is a drum or disc which in use is provided with a plurality of symbols, such as fruit, around the periphery thereof and can be rotated for a period of time and then brought to rest at one of say 20 stopping positions thereof to display in such stopping position one or more of said symbols. a fruit machine usually has three or four such reel assemblies and in use, during play of a game, the drums or discs may rotate for different random periods of time and display when stopped a randomly selected combination of symbols. with this arrangement, for rotating the different discs or drums it is known to connect the discs or drums via slipping clutches to the drive shaft of a common electric motor. the drums or discs have teeth around the periphery of same and stopping of each disc or drum in precise registration with one of the 20 stopping positions thereof is effected by means of a respective solenoid operated indexing device which moves an arresting pawl into engagement with the teeth. with this known arrangement, the requisite clutch arrangement and motor drive is particularly complex and expensive to manufacture. also, and particularly having regard to the interconnection of the different discs and drums via the common drive arrangement, repair and maintenance work and replacement of component parts can be different or inconvenient. it is also known to use an arrangement of independently rotatable drums or discs with a respective drive device for each such drum or disc comprising a solenoid operated pawl mechanism engageable with teeth on the periphery of the drum or disc. each drum or disc is set in motion by pulling the -respective pawl sharply away from the teeth so that a tangential impulse is applied to the drum or discs and stopping of the drum or disc is effected by release of the pawl such that it moves back into arresting engagement with the teeth (in like manner to the above described indexing device). with this arrangement, however, the solenoids apply large thrusts to the drums or discs which may cause undue wed r 5 rota wrings or mountings thereof. also, the solenoids require a high operating current and any fluctuation in the power supply may introduce an element of uncertainty into the operation of the solenoid drive. such uncertainty may be particularly undesirable in a fruit machine having a 'nudge' facility, that is, in which a control is provided for causing a stationary disc or drum to advance from one stopping position to the next

claims:   1. a rotatably mounted member comprising a member which is mounted on a support structure so as to be rotatable relative thereto through a plurality of predetermined stopping positions, an electrical drive motor being provided for effecting said rotation of the member, and indexing means being provided for stopping the member in one of said stopping positions thereof, characterised in that said drive motor is an integral part of the rotatably mounted member.   2. a mounted member according to claim 1, characterised in that the motor is direct-coupled to the member.   3. a mounted member according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that structural parts of the rotatably mounted member are used. as structural parts of the motor.   4. a mounted member according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the motor has a rotor and a stator, characterised in that one of said rotor (6) and stator   (11)    is mounted   on    or forms parts of the said support structure (5), and the other of said rotor (6) and stator (11) is secured to or forms parts of the said member.   5. a mounted member according to claim 4, characterised in that said member comprises a metal disc (6) which forms said rotor.   6. a mounted member according to claim 5,  characterised in that a magnet (19) is positioned alongside the disc (6) to clamp rotation thereof.   7. a mounted member according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the motor is a rotary linear motor.   8. a mounted member according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the motor is a reversible motor.   9. a mounted member according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the said indexing means (9) comprises a solenoid operated catch finger (10) which can be moved into engagement with teeth (7) on the member (6) to arrest rotation thereof.   10. a mounted member according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the said indexing means (9) comprises a spring pawl (33) engageable with ratchet teeth (32) on the member (6) to permit rotation of the member in a forward direction but to prevent rotation thereof in a reverse direction, means being provided to bias the member in the reverse direction on stopping thereof.    11. an entertainment machine characterised in that it comprises: a plurality of rotatably mounted members     accordin    to any one of claims 1 to 10, a position identification system (30, 31) for identifying the stopping positions of the respective members, and an evaluation system (mpu) for evaluating the combination of identified stopping positions.      12.    an entertainment machine according to claim 11, characterised in that the said position identifying system comprises coded arrangements of holes- (24, 25) in discs (6) of the said members, light sensors and light sources (30, 31) being used to read such arrangements.   13. an entertainment machine according to claim 11 or 12, characterised in that it it a fruit machine.
