<ABSTRACT>
a waste gas recovery system employs a compressor (20)  which takes in raw waste gas from an inlet knock-out drum  (10) and passes compressed gas through a heat exchanger  (24) to an outlet knock-out drum (11).  the temperature at the  outlet of the compressor (20) is sensed by a device (18) which  operates valves (28,29) to inject liquid coolant into the com足 pressor inlet and to re-circulate gas back from the outlet of  the outlet knock-out drum (11) to inhibit an excessive temp足 erature rise.  a pressure-sensing device (19) senses the pres足 sure of the gas passing into the compressor (20) and controls  both the speed of the compressor (20) and and adjustable  throttle valve (27) to regulate the glas flow.  the throttle valve  (27) is closed automatically should there be a fall in the pres足 sure of the gas at the inlet below a safe level.  in this event,  further pressure-sensing devices (92,97) act additionally to  close the recirculating gas valve (29) and a further valve (84)  in the main inlet flow path to reliably isolate the compressor  (20).
