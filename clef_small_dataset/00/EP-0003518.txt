<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method of contriving countersunk or counterbored apertures (2, 3) in a metal com ponent of narrow bar or strip material (1), more particularly with a flat rectangular cross-section, as, for example in a faceplace for drive rod fittings, which apertures (2, 3) serve as the inner boundary of a neck (4) projecting from the main plane in the direction of the greatest diameter of such apertures have extending around them a recess (10) disposed opposite the neck (4) and are adapted to receive the heads of fixing elements, more particularly screws, characterised in that the bar or strip material (1) is initially pierced into a free space with a diameter corresponding to the nominal dimension (17) of the aperture (2, 3), whereafter in the same working stroke as the first piercing and immediately thereafter the counter sunk zone is pressed into the aperture and the neck (4) is stamped upwardly with sharp edges and perpendicularly from the main plane of the bar or a strip material (1) concentrically around this initial piercing by the pressing of the counter sunk zone (3) into the initial aperture initially being started from above, whereafter, and from below, a sharp-edged stamping-in of the recess (10) of at least substantially the same diameter (12) as the neck (4) is initiated perpendicularly to the main plane of the bar or strip material (1), whereafter, as the countersunk zone (3) continues to be pressed in further and the recess (10) continues to be stamped in further, the neck (4) is formed upwardly and an annular head (14) is formed in the recess (10) with displacement of material.
