<ABSTRACT>
a coating composition comprising a curable copolymer  material which is the product of a condensation reaction, pre­ ferably a condensation reaction of corresponding molar quan­ tities of an organic diamine and a silicone containing a bis-ami­ no aryl ether or bis-amino aryl thioether and an organic dianhy­ dride in at least one organic solvent chosen from monoalkyl  ethers of ethylene glycol, monoalkyl ethers of condensed poly­ ethylene glycol, dialkyl ethers of ethylene glycol, dialkyl ethers  of condensed polyethylene glycol, and cyclic ethers containing  not less than a 5 member ring, is suitable for use as a wire coat­ ing composition, passivation and/or protective coating com­ position(s) for semiconductor devices and the like.  a part or all  of the organic diamine may be a macrocyclic crown ether  which enables the curable copolymer material to have a chemi­ cally bonded chelant embodies therein.  the curable copolymer  material may be of a block type configuration, a random type  configuration, or both, and either may be cured at a low tem­ perature such as ∼75°c when diethylene glycol dimethylether  is chosen as solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
"copolymeric coating compositions". the present invention relates to a copolymeric coating composition comprising a curable copolymer material having a silicone component and at least one organic solvent therefor. such coating compositions provide protective coating materials suitable, for instance, for use on semiconductor elements, metal parts such as gear teeth and cookware, and as a wire coating enamel. industry is always looking for improved coating materials which will protect their products as well as enhancing the physical properties thereof. where possible, industry prefers a one component material and a simple curing cycle to achieve the desired end results. however, as the need arises, industry requires that such desirous one component materials must be capable of multiple applications to achieve a multi-layer coating wherein all layers adhere tenaciously to adjoining layers. the material must also be readily removable for component repair purposes and be adaptable for recoating in only that component repair area with the same or a similar material and still retain the integrity of the coating layer end the overall protection of the device or article of manufacture. some articles of manufacture have the ability to withstand high temperatures, of the order of 3()00c, for short periods of time to enable the employment or a high temperature curing cycle. other articles of manufacture cannot withstand high temperatures even for a short period of time. therefore, the desired coating material must be available in another form whereby a single low temperature, of the order of 1200c to 1500c, curing cycle is desirable. a particular need is for curable solutions of preimidized materials wherein solvent evaporation is practical at temperatures less than 100 c end the solvent doss not chemically attack epoxy resin circuit boards. heretofore polymer and copolymer materials disclosed in the teachings of hobeck et al., u.s. patent specification no. 3,740,305, shaw, u.s. patent specification no. 3,615,913, chang et al., u.s. patent specification no. 3,684,592, end berger, u.s. patent specification no. 4,030,948, provide adequate coatings for some articles of manufacture but are unable to meet specific coating material needs for providing desired physical properties which other articles of manufacture require in order to function properly. therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide en improved coating composition for applying material for protecting and/or pessivating selected surface areas of articles of manufacture. another object of this invention is to provide an improved copolymeric coating composition whose copolymer can be cured to form a coating layer film at e temperature of about 1500c or less. according to the present invention there is provided a coating composition which comprises: a curable copolymer material (1) defined at least partially by the general formula: emi3.1 in which there are present from 40 to 99 mole percent intercondeneed structural units defined by the general emi3.2 or at least partially by the general formula emi4.1 wherein in the general formulae (i), (ii) and (iii) a is a silicone having the general formula: emi4.2 wherein q is an aromatic nucleus; r is a divalent group or
