<ABSTRACT>
the tool 10 for thermosonic attachment of fine wire  leads to terminal pads of semiconductor devices is mounted  in a holder 11 which conveys ultrasonic vibrations to the tool.   for heating the working tip 24 of the tool a resistive-film  heater 23 is applied to a frusto-conical surface of the tool.   terminal pads 22 for the heater 23 are resiliently engaged by  ends 19 of leads 17, which can be separated, for replacement  of the tool, by means of a cam 18.  the resistive film heater,  which may take various forms and be used with insulating  layers covering an electrically-conductive tool, with covering  layers of low emissivity and with terminal pads of various  forms, offers advantages of ease of manufacture, reliability,  low mass, and control of temperature by monitoring  changes of resistance.
