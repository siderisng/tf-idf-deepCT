<ABSTRACT>
1.  coin testing device for electronic parking meters for parking premises for verifying admissible coins and for producing corresponding electrical signals to operate an electronic evaluation device in which the coin switches in drive means for driving a transport device by means of which the coin is moved past a first sensing means, the transport device influencing via the coin and by means of the first sensing means selector means on which in accordance with the diameter of the admissible coin values control elements are distributed which represent the coin criterion the selector means after having been arrested in a sensing position cooperating with a second sensing means which in the course of movement of the transport device driven by the driving means is moved into the direction of the control elements characterized in that the control elements (33, 34, 35) represent one part each of a switch whilst the counter part (41) is connected to the second sensing means (40), that each control element is connected by means of lines attached thereto to one input of the evaluation device, that switched in series with the switches (33, 34, 35, 41) there is another switch (49) which is arranged in the transport path of the coin (28) and is directly operated thereby after it has passed the sensing position, the switches (33, 34, 35, 41) on the one hand and the switch (49) on the other hand being in a logical and-function so that an evaluation of the coin criterion in the evaluation device (ae) is only effected when the and-function is fulfilled.
