<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrophotographic on drawing material (10) and its use in a copy method. The recording material (10) consists of an electrically conductive support member, a charge carrier producing layer (12) and a charge transport layer (14). The latter according to the invention as charges trans porting compound a hydrazone of the general formula in which the radicals R₂ = -oc₂H₃; -CH₃; -C₂H₅; -H R₃ = -H; -oc₂H₅ R₄ = -h; -CH₃; -C₂H₅ r₅ = -h; -CH₃ R₆ = -C₄H₅; -CH₂-C₆H₅; -CH₃; N-C₄H₉ R₇ = -C₆H₅; -CH₃ mean, and a polymeric binder. A preferred charges transporting compound is ρ-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (diphenythydrazone). As a bin, a polycarbonate, polyester or acrylic heart, or mixtures of the disks is used. The charge carriers transport layer (14) having a thickness of at least 5 μm, depending on the sign of the charging of the landing carrier generating layer, may be arranged on the landing carrier-generating layer (12) or between the same and the conductive support carrier. The invention also relates to the use of the multilayer recording material in an electrophotographic copying process.
