<ABSTRACT>
a catalyst system for alpha-olefin type polymerizations,  which includes at least one metal alkyl compound having the  formula rnmr′3-n in combination with a group iva-viii transi­ tion metal compound on a support and at least one lewis base  wherein r is c₃ to c₂₀ secondary or tertiary alkyl, cycloalkyl,  alkenyl araralkyl groups; r′ is c₁ to c₂₀ primary alkyl, alkenyl  or aralkyl groups, or hydrogen, m is aluminum, gallium, or  indium; and n = 0-3.  the improved catalyst system provides  polymers having increased isotactic stereoregularity as well  as lower catalyst residue.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: trialkyl aluminium cocatalyst the present invention relates to catalyst systems for the conventional alpha olefin type polymerisation at significantly improved polymerization activity, wherein the resultant polymers have a high degrae of isotactic stereoregularity. an object of the present invention is to provide improved catalyst systems having a major increase in polymerization activity while being able to control over a wide range the polymer crystallinity, e.g., isotacticity, wherein the catalyst system includes a transition metal compound and a metal trialklyl compound of al, ga or in having at least one secondary or tertiary alkyl group. a further object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for alpha-olefin type polymerizations, wherein the polymerization activity is increased and the formed polymer has a high degree of isotactic stereoregularity and a minium amount of catalyst residues are formed. a still further object of the present invention is to use directly the new improved catalyst with various &num;types of supported transition metal compounds without substantial modification of the commercial catalyst preparation or the polymerizatiuon plant. a still, further object of the present invention i. to provide new improved catalyst composition wherein the isotacticity of the formed polymer is much less sensitive to a ratio of the cocatalyst (trialkyl metal compound) to the transition metal compound tn when the correspcnding primary alkyl compounds are used, thereby greatly facilitating process control to make higher quality polymers at more efficient production rates. additionally, another object of the present invention is to provide a process and compositions whereby r mr'2 or r2mr' are produced as cocatalysts in situ by the reactions: emi3.1 it is well knows in the art to use an alkyl metal compound of groups i-tii in combination with a transition metal compound of groups iv4-viii as a catalyst system for olefinic polymerization. while nearly all of the alkyl metal compounds are effective for the polymerization of ethylene, only a few are effective for the preparation of isotactic polymers of propylene and higher alpha olefins and only rt2alc1 alet3 and i-bu2alh have any important commercial utility. a major cost involved in the polymerization ox the alpha olefins is the cost of the catalyst components. therefore, the cost of the manufacture of the polymer can be effectively reduced by the use of catalyst systems having a higher polymerization activity. a further concern is the ability to produce polymers having a minimum amount of catalyst residues thereby eliminating a costly deashing operation. a still further concern is the ability to pro- duce polymers having a thigh degree of isotactic stereoregularity thereby enabling the manufacturer- to eliminate or reduce the costly operation involving the removal and separation of atactic polymer from the isotactic polymer. the improved catalyst system of the present invention provides a means to the manufacturer of obtaining these desirable realizations. the improved catalyst systems of the present invention which are employed in alpha olefin polymerizations include a group iva-vili transition metal compound, one or more lewis bases, and at least one metal alkyl
