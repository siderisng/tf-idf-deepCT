<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of impact resistant polystyrenes having improved transparency transparent impact-resistant polymers or resinous compositions are highly desirable for many packaging operations. polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate are both resins having a highly desirable degree of transparency for many packaging applications; however, both polystyrene and polymethylmethacry late are often found to be too brittle to provide a reliable package, particularly when used as containers or as vacuum-formed oriented sheet, tubs or lids. in an effort to improve the impact resistance of resins such as polystyrene, rubber has been added to the polystyrene in one manner or the other to provide either a dispersion of solid rubber particles within a polystyrene matrix or a dispersion of rubber particles containing occluded polystyrene dispersed within a polystyrene matrix. employing such techniques a substantial increase in the impact resistance of the polymer composition is obtained; however, the resultant product is usually opaque or translucent and is unsatisfactory for packaging applications which require a transparent material. biaxial orientation of certain rubber-containing impact-resistant styrene polymer films results in a product having improved transparency; however, when such articles are obtained in a heavier or thicker section the opacity is usually too great or the impact resistance is inadequate. in an attempt to produce transparent impact-resistant styrene polymers, considerable effort has been expended in employing as a polymer matrix a copolymer of methylmethacrylate and styrene, the methylmethacrylate and styrene being employed in such a proportion that the refractive index of the reinforcing rubber and the methylmethacrylate-styrene polymer differ by an insignificant value thereby providing a resinous body which does not scatter large amounts of light and, at least to the unaided eye, in thin sections, appears to be transparent. the resultant polymers, using refractive index matching, usually are polymers which have methylmethacrylate as a major component. another technique of providing a rubber-reinforced styrene polymer of improved transparency is shown in u.s. 3,574,151 wherein styrene is polymerized in the presence of rubber and a small quantity of 8-bromostyrene. u.s. patent 3,957,915 teaches the use of other bromine-containing compounds for this purpose. this invention provides an improved process for preparing impact resistant polymers having improved transparency and composed primarily of styrene and a reinforcing rubber. the process of this invention comprises providing a solution of a rubber in styrene or a mixture of styrene with minor amounts of vinyltoluene, t-butylstyrene or methyl methacrylate and from 0.01 to 0.5, preferably 0.01 to 0.3, percent by weight based on the combined weight of the rubber and styrene of a monoethylenically terminally unsaturated allylic bromine -containing aliphatic compound having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms and polymerizing under free radical conditions and with agitation at least through phase inversion. the process of this invention provides a styrene polymer structure having a dispersed phase of a reinforcing diene rubber, the diene rubber advantageously being present in a proportion of 4 to 12 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the combined weight of styrene and rubber. the rubber is generally in the form of a
