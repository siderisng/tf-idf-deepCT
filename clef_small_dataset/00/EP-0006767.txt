<ABSTRACT>
methods and apparatus described increase, within  a predetermined frequency band, the continuous or near-­ continuous transmission of broadband acoustic power  into a medium of finite tensile strength such as water or  earth, and also reduce, for a given broadband acoustic  power level in a given frequency band, the negative dynamic  pressure or stress excursion of an acoustic signal relative  to the average present without the signal.  such signals,  which may be transmitted for geophysical purposes, place  the medium alternately under compressive and tensile  stresses relative to some average stress, the duration of  application of compressive stress being short compared  with the duration of application of tensile stress, tensile  stress not exceeding the tensile strength of the medium  or interfaces.  preferably, the minimum duration of com­ pressive stress is in excess of one-half period of the upper  frequency limit of the desired spectral band, while the  maximum duration of a contiguous tensile and compres­ sive stress pair is approximately one period of the desired  lower frequency limit of the band.
