<ABSTRACT>
In an ion implantation apparatus for bombing a semiconductor wafer with a ion beam, means are provided to hold the beam and the troubleshooting electrode or the semiconductor waist to be bleed under a vacuum of 2 x 10⁻⁴ Torr or smaller pressures. The device includes a mass separator (20), d. H. An analyzing magnet which supplies selected ions to form the desired beam with a trajectory along a selected axis. The troubleshooting electrode (26, 33) is arranged along this selected axis. Further, a housing (25) extending from the mass separator (20) according to the trapping electrode (26, 33) is provided and encloses the axis lying within a chamber and the troubleshooting electrode (26, 33), wherein within this chamber transverse to the axis Beam of forming means with a longitudinally arranged axis (23, 27) or opening are provided which allow the passage of a selected part of the ion beam according to the detection electrode (26, 33). A vacuum pump (28) is connected via an opening in the housing with the chamber and lies transverse to the beam forming means, so that gas can be withdrawn from both sides of these means forming the beam.
