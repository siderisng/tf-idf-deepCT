<ABSTRACT>
shaped articles, such as corrugated sheets, are manu­ factured from a dry mixture of mineral powder and organic  binders which, from a dosage device (9), is applied in a layer  in a mould (12) which defines an optionally corrugated sub­ stratum.  a good adhesion to the powder mixture is imparted  to the surface of the substratum, preferably by applying a sur­ face layer of a mixture of a binder and mineral powder.  the  mould (12) is advanced under the dosage device (9) and un­ der a special shaping and compressing device (11) for the  powder mixture.  the contact face of the device (11) has a  profile adapted to the shape of the articles, is mounted be­ hind the dosage device transversely across the entire width  of the mould (12) and is inclined a few degrees relative to the  plane of mould travel so that the relative movement of the  contact face of the device (11) ensures a uniform compres­ son of the powder layer (13).  the compressed powder mix­ ture is then hot-pressed into shaped articles.  the apparatus  comprises moulds (12), which define optionally corrugated  substrata, heating devices, pressing devices and dosage de­ vice (9), behind which there is mounted a shaping and com­ pressing device (11), as described above.  during the advanc­ ing operation the moulds (12) may be fixed in the proper posi­ tion in that they are placed on their respective suction boxes  (15).  the suction boxes (15) are interconnected to a chain,  and their surfaces correspond to the lower surface of the  moulds (12).  the suction boxes (15) are provided with holes  for the provision of vacuum under the moulds (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
h method of making shaped articles and an apparatus for carrying out the method withe present invention relates to a method of making shaped articles from a dry mixture of mineral powder and organic polymeric binders which is applied in a layer in a oul by means of a dosage device, said mould defining a substratum with a profile adapted to the desire shape of the article, and is then heated and compressed into shaped articles of the desired shape. known methods of making various shaped articles, such as plane e or profiled sheets from mineral powders or organic poly7meric binders, are based on the fct that these mixtures are plastic or semi-liquid. when subjected to calendering or extrusion and also compression in moulds the mixtures will spread and fill e mould prior to curing, leading to products of the desired shape. when the amount of binder is significantly reduced, e.g. to 5-6% by weight, , which is very desirable seen from an economic point of view, such mixtures will no longer possess any measurable plastic flowing unless solvents are and it is therefore very difficult, if not impossible to obtain satisfactory products by the above methods. if solvents or water is used, which must then be removed at a '-ter stage in the process, the products will get a lower specific weight, and another drawback is t'ne additional amount of energy required to remove the solvents or water. been e mould is filled with a dry powder it is important that the whole mould part should be filled with the proper amount of powder mixture, because the products will then have the desired thickness and there will be no need for replenishment of the mould, nor will there be any excess powder to remove. if, however, an ordinary, smooth steel mould, which may be plane or profiled in one dimension, is filled with 2 dry ponder mixture by dosage of the powder from the tot bj means of a dosage device, such as a hopper, it 5 very difficult to avoid vertical cracks in the powder relative to the plane of mould travel, in particular if the ould is profiled. the reason is that the powder tents to slide along the smooth surface of the mould. the object of the present invention is to provide a method of making shaped articles having a uniform density and good mechanical properties, which eliminates these drawbacks and permits the use of substantially dry powder mixtures which have no significant flowing when compressed. another object of the invention is to obtain a uniform filling of the whole mould without cracks in the powder. accordingly, the invention provides a method of making shaped articles from a dry mixture of a major amount of mineral powder and organic binders which is applied in a layer in moulds by means of a dosage device, said moulds defining a substratum with a profile adapted to the desired shape of the article and is then heat-treated and co-pressed,
