<ABSTRACT>
a method of producing anamorphic images on a carrier by  filming or reduction printing or enlargement, whereby the  hitherto inevitable loss in image height on classical 35 mm,  16 mm, super 8 film and or videotape is avoided by providing  the carrier at both sides of the image or image-receiving area  and over the full height thereof with a blank strip.  for a negative  carrier the strips are transparent and for a positive they are  opaque and for video tape they are simply unrecorded.  the  positioning of the strips is such that, during projection of the  carrier, they fall on the border bounding the screen, the aspect  ratio of the projected images between the projected strips is  2. 35:1.  moreover, the small surplus in the thus obtained image  width is the same as in the case of 35 mm anamorphic projection  and is being masked off by the masking border of the  projection screen.  the, on other than the standardized 35 mm anamorphic  images, thus obtained aspect ratios will for all formats be  identical to the standardized 35 mm anamorphic image aspect  ratio for the camera of appr.  1. 18:1 and for final reproduction of  appr.  2. 35:1.
