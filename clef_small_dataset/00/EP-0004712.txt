<ABSTRACT>
the process comprises mixing chopped glass fibres with  plastics-forming ingredients and moulding or forming the  mixture to obtain reinforced plastics articles.  the invention  lies in the use of chopped glass fibres in filamentary form conveniently the glass fibres are first made into a slurry  or paste, which forms the aspect of the invention, with a  liquid compatible with the plastics-forming ingredients or  with all or a part of one or more of the ingredients.  the  invention includes a novel form of chopped glass fibres  formed from glass strand bound with a size containing as the  main ingredient one component of a plastics-forming mixture  or a derivative thereof.  it also includes apparatus for mixing the glass fibre paste  or slurry with plastics-forming ingredients by impingement  mixing (figure 1).  the invention is of special use for reinforcing with glass  fibres plastics articles, especially polyurethane plastics articles,  formed by a reaction injection moulding (rim) process.
