<ABSTRACT>
the system for the control and regulation of electrodes  immersion depth in an esr process according to the pre足 sent invention, is suitable for the case in which two elec足 trodes (4, 5) are connected in series to a power source (3)  and each of the electrodes has an independent feed  mechanism.  the present invention is based on the assumption that  the slag used in the esr process has a composition which  does not vary during the process, thus also enabling to  assume that two equal lengths of slag have equal electrical  resistance.  hence the slag comprised between the elec足 trodes tips and the molten metal bath can be considered as  two variable resistances which are equal only when the  electrodes tips are at the same distance from the molten  metal bath.  thus said two variable resistances can be used in a sort  of electrical bridge, which can be suitably balanced.  should  an electrode be consumed more rapidly than the other, the  thickness of the slag, as well as its electrical resistance,  existing between the electrode tip and the molten metal will  increase, thus unbalancing the bridge.  the amplitude and  direction of this unbalancement will tell both which elec足 trode is consumed more rapidly and to which rate, thus  enabling the operator, or an automatic device, to correct the  feed rate of the electrode.
