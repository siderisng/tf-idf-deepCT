<DESCRIPTION>
x-pay intensi@ying screen based on a tantalate phosphor and process for producing phosphor this invention relates to the preparation of a luminescent material and to the use of the material in x-ray intensifying screens. background art x-ray intensifying screens are generally used in conjunction with photographic film and serve to enhance the image formed on the film. phosphors which are the active components of such screens should be clear, colorless, single phase materials, crystallizing in polyhedr@l shape of well defined habit so as to minimize any scattering of the light generated by the x-rays. generally, the phosphor particle size should be about 3 to 10 um and the surface area should be about 0.075 to 0.300 m2/g. moreover, the phosphors should be good absorbers of x-ray radiation of the energy used, they should emit light strongly in the region of the spectrum to which the film is sensitive, and they should provide sharp, undistorted film images. while there are many known matorials which exhibit luminescence, few have the combination of properties necessary to make them useful in x-ray intensitying screens. for example, the most widely used phosphor for x-ray intensifying screens for many years has been calcium. tungstate; it is the standard by which other phosphors are judged. in recent years several other phosphors have been proposed for possible use in x-ray intensifying screens, but the number is smail compared to the total number of phosphors which have been discovered. blasse and bril (j. of luminescence 3, 109 (1970)) describe the cathodo- and photo-luminescent properties of various ytao4, gdtao4 and lutao4 phosphors, including those in which some of the tantalum is replaced by niobium or some of the yttrium is replaced by rare earth substituents. these materials all havo the fergusonite m-type structure. it has been recognized that these materials have to polymorphs, a monociinic (12 space group) structure m at low temperatures and a tetragonal (scheelite-type structure with space group i42 ) at high tempera- turves. transition between these two forms is instantaneous and rextersible. g, m. molten and a. b. chase (the american mineralogist 52, 1536 (1967)) report that this transition occurs at 1325 c in ytao4. they also disclose a new polymorph of yttrium tantalate and related rare earth tantalates; if the material is crystallizd below the transformation temperature, a different monoelinic strueture (calied m1 phase, with space group p2/a) results, which m1 phase can be converted to the m phase by heating above 1400 c and then cooling to below 1325 c. it is believed that there ns s no prior at on the luminescent properties of the m1-phase materials under ultraviolet or x-ray exaitation. brief description of the drawings figures la and lb depiet, respectively, m1-type ynb0.05ta0.95o4 of the instant invention, made as disclosed herein, and the canning electron mierographs of m-type ynb0.05ta0.95o4, made via conventional ceramic techniques, zor example, as disclosed by blasse and bril, loc. cit. figure 2 shows diffractometer scans of x-ray powder patterns for m-type ytao4 and m1-type ytao4. figures 3a
