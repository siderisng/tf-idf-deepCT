<ABSTRACT>
for reducing parasitic coupling between at least one type of doping area (20) in a semiconductor substrate (10) (20) and an electrically conductive layer (28) provided above, which over the doping area (20) a greater distance from the substrate surface as outside thereof and Thus, a uneven surface has, on the uneven surface of the conductive layer (28), a this fully covered masking layer (30), preferably made of a photoresist, is applied so that a now placed surface (32) is formed. Subsequently, a uniform layer thickness portion (L) is removed from the masking layer (30) until the surface of the region of the electrically conductive layer (28) is exposed to the highest survey. Thereafter, the guide capable layer (28) in the thus exposed area is removed. With the specified method, capacitive-capacitive low-bit-type FET storage arrangements can be set up when the bit line is designed as a strip shaped doping area (20) in the substrate (10) and the conductive layer preferably made of polycrystalline silicon, conductive layer (28 ) is formed as a shielding layer or as an electrode of the storage capacitors.
