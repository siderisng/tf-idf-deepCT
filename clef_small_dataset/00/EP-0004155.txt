<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a hub (1) for a spoked  wheel, comprising a hub shell (11) having at opposite axial  ends thereof a pair of opposed hub flange means (12) and a  hub shaft (10) for rotatably supporting said hub shell (11)  with a pair of bearing means (14, 15) disposed between said  hub shaft (10) and hub shell (11); each of said hub flange  means (12) having a plurality of spoke apertures (13) each  extending generally parallel to the axis of said hub shell (11),  said plurality of spoke apertures (13) being arranged generally  concentrically with respect to the axis of said hub shell  (11).  in order to facilitate assembly of the spoked wheel and  avoid distortion of the spokes, the plurality of spoke apertures  (13) is provided in the form of a first group (13a) and a  second group (13b) of spoke apertures axially displaced relative  to each other, successive ones of said first and second  groups (13a, 13b) alternating with each other.  the invention also provides a spoked wheel incorporating  a hub of the invention.
