<ABSTRACT>
compensation is provided in a welded structure formed  from dissimilar metals e. g.  carbon steel and stainless steel  for knife-line corrosion occuring at the interface between the  dissimilar metals by making the length of the path along  which knife-line corrosion is liable to occur between the  metals towards the load bearing area of the weld exceed the  expected extent of knife-line corrosion over the design life of  the structure.  the interface exposed to the corrosive environÂ­ ment may be displaced from the load bearing region of the  weld by providing a layer of metal e. g.  the weld metal over,  and fused to the surface of the one of the components with  which the metal of the layer forms a knife-line corrodable  combination.  that surface may include the surface of an  appendage integral with or welded to the component.

<DESCRIPTION>
welded structures this invention relates to welded structures and in particular to welded metal structures that are intended for use in a corrosive environment. while it is clearly desirable to use metals that are resistant to corrosion, for economic or other reasons this is not always possible. when a structure is designed, the thiokness of the components is determined not only by the intended load bearing requirements and the strength of the metal employed, but also by the amount of corrosion anticipated during the life of the structure, so that, in spite of corrosion, the structure will still have adequate strength at the end of its design life. in some structures it is necessary to weld together components of different metals. with some metal combinations, if the welded junction between the metals is exposed to a cor- rosive environment, accelerated corrosion at that exposed junction tends to occur producing what is known as knife-line corrosion down the interface between the two metals from the exposed junction. with other metal combinations, particularly where the metals are similar to one another knife-line corrosion does not occur, or only occurs to an insignificant extent: thus knifeline corrosion is liable to occur at a stainless steel/carbon steel junction but may be insignificant at a junction between two different stainless steels or between two different carbon steels. in the present specification the term knife-line core rodable combination is utilised where the metals are ones between which a junction is liable to significant knife-line corrosion. the extent of knife-line corrosion in a knife-line corrodable metal combination may be several times the normal anticipated corrosion at areas away from the junction between the metals. for example, in the case of a carbon steel/stainless steel junction, whereas the normal anticipated corrosion of the carbon steel component over the design life of the structure may extend to a depth of 2 - 3 mm from the component surface, the extent of knife-line corrosion occuring at the carbon steel/stainless steel interface over the same period may be 1 2 cm or more. clearly, unless measures are taken to counter the effect of such knife-line corrosion, the life of the structure will be greatly reduced. in some cases knife-line corrosion can be avoided by providing the surface of the structure with a protective coating: however such coatings require meintenance and in some applications may not be satisfactory for other reasons. in the present invention these problems are reduced by arranging the weld configuration so that the length of the path along which knife-line corrosion takes place from the metal-metal junction exposed to the corrosive environment is increased. accordingly we provide a welded structure, for use in a corrosive environment, including a weld between components formed from metals of a knife-line corrodable metal combination, in which each path liable to knife-line corrosion, from the corrosive environment, to each metal-metal junction in the load bearing region of the weld that is liable to knife-line corrosion, has a length at least equal to the
