<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a fastening or clamping device  comprising a fastening or clamping element, for example a  screw or a nut, and an operating knob connected with the  fastening or clamping element.  in order to prevent undue  operation of the fastening or clamping element the fastening  or clamping device according to the invention comprises a  locking device (32), which is changeable between two  different positions.  in the first of these positions the locking  device unrotatably fixes the operating knob (22) in relation to  the fastening or clamping element (20) so that said element  can be rotated by means of the operating knob.  in the second  of said positions the locking device allows the operating  knob to be unobstructedly rotated in relation to the fastening  or clamping device so that it is not possible to operate the  fastening or clamping element by means of the operating  knob.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a fastening or clamping device of the kind comprising a rotatable fastening or clamping element, for example a screw or a nut, and an operating knob connected with the fastening or clamping element. devices of the kind defined above are often used in luggage carriers, such as roof racks, ski holders or the like, in order to connect the carriers to the edges of a car roof. fastening or clamping devices of said kind are also used for retaining objects, for example surf boards, to luggage carriers for vehicles. thereby, it is previously known to use different kinds of locking devices for preventing that the luggage carriers and/or the objects supported thereby are stolen. however, it brings about substantial additional costs to use conventional locking devices and therefore it is desirable to provide a fastening or clamping device which per se comprises a locking device, which prevents undue releasing of the fastening or clamping device and thereby prevents that the object fastened by means of the fastening or clamping device is stolen. in order to comply with this object the fastening or clamping device according to the invention comprises a locking device, which is adapted to take two different positions, a first position, in which the locking device unrotatably fixes the operating knob in relation to the fastening or clamping element in order to allow that said element is. rotated by means of the operating knob, and a second position, in which the locking device allows that the operating knob is unobstructedly rotated in relation-to the fastening or clamping element in order to prevent rotation thereof by means of the operating knob. thereby, the fastening or clamping device can either comprise a locking device, which has a lock element which by means of a key in a conventional way is movable between the two positions, or comprise a fixing element which in said first position unrotatably fixes the knob in relation to the fastening or clamping element and which is easily detachable from the device so that the knob is in said second position unobstructedly rotatable in relation to the fastening or clamping device because of the fact that the fixing element has been detached from the device. in the first mentioned case an embodiment of the fastening or clamping device according to the invention is distinguished by the fact that a substantially annular portion is fixedly and substantially concentrically connected with the fastening or clamping element, that the operating knob encloses the annular portion and in said second position of the locking device is unobstructedly rotatable in relation to the fastening or clamping element and that the locking device is supported by the operating knob, the lock element firmly engaging the annular portion in said first position of the locking device and being out of engagement with the annular portion in said second position of the locking device. thereby it is suitable that the locking device extends from the operating knob into the space
