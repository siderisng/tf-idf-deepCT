<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coupling device for coupling two tandem cycles by means of a coupling bar (3) characterized in that said coupling bar (3) is attached to each of the two cycles by an articulation toCardan (4.5) consisting of a first holes (15) integral with one of the two ends of the bar, from a Cardan venue (10) articulating in said first filchete (15) by one ofits arms (11), and a second fork (13) turned on the other arm (12) of the furrow (10), means being provided for fixing said second holes (13) to oneCycles (1), an arm of a cross being parallel to an arm of the other cross and the other two arms of the two brackets being concurring when the two cycles are in the same vertical plane.
