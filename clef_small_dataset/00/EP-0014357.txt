<ABSTRACT>
the invention is directed to a dust seal arrangement for a  portable tool such as drill, hammer-drill, rotary hammer or the  like having a bit receiving end for receiving a tool bit therein.   the dust seal arrangement includes a dust seal (15) which  coacts with the tool bit (60) and the bit receiving end (13) of the  tool.  the tool bit (60) and tool receiving end (13) have  respective surfaces (32), (43) disposed in surrounding relation  to the common longitudinal axis of the tool bit (50) end tool  receiving end (13).  the dust seal (15) has a first end portion  (27) defining an axially extending opening (29) of  predetermined dimension, shaped to coact with the surface  (32) of the tool bit (50) to provide a first interference fit  therewith.  a second end portion (35) of the dust seal (15) is  axially spaced from the first end portion (27) and is connected  thereto.  the second end portion (35) has a second axially  extending opening (39) of predetermined dimension shaped  to coact with the surface (43) of the bit receiving end (13) to  provide a second interference fit therewith.  the second  interference fit is lighter then the first interference fit such that  the seal (15) moves substantially in unison with the bit (50)  while slipping upon the contacted surface (43) of the bit  receiving end (13).
