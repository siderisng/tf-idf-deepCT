<ABSTRACT>
a gas cooker 12 having a burner unit 10 which is convert­ ible to a) grill food or b) boil water in a kettle or cook food in a  pot or pan.  the burner unit includes a burner tube 16 located below  an opening 17 in a frame 14 and a pair of pivotal plates 18  which can overlie the opening 17 for grilling purposes or be  pivoted away to leave the opening clear.  in the latter position a  grid 25 is located over the opening.  the plates 18 have a  radiant panel 19 on one face, i. e. , the underface in the grilling  position.  thus the cooker can be used not only for grilling food  located on a tray or spit 13 below the burner tube, but alterna­ tively can be used to heat a kettle, pot or pan located on the  grid 25 when the opening 17 is not closed by the plates.  the gas cooker may be transportable collapsible rotis­ serie.

<DESCRIPTION>
gas cooker with convertible burner unit this invention relates to gas cookers especially, but not exclusively to a gas cooker having only one burner unit, for example, a portable gas cooker such as a rotisserie. portable rotisseries are known wherein a burner tube is located below a heat-reflector plate which in operation reflects downwardly infra-red rays onto a spit or grill tray. such cookers are made specifically for grilling and little or no heat passes through the reflector plate so that the cooker cannot be used for boiling water or cooking food other than by grilling. it is an object of the present invention to provide a gas cooker in which the burner element or one of the burner elements can be used alternatively for grilling or for other forms of cooking or boiling. according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a gas cooker including a burner unit whereof a horizontal burner tube is mounted in underslung relation to a frame symmetrical thereabout and whereby an opening in the frame can be masked immediately above the burner tube, or unmasked at least in part, by a reflector in the form of at least two plates each hinged or pivoted for movement about an axis spaced within the opening whereby the opening can be masked for grilling purposes or unmasked at least in part for heating a cooking utensil located over the opening. according to another aspect of the invention there is provided a burner unit for a gas cooker, said unit comprising a horizontally disposed burner tube mounted in underslung relation to a frame symmetrical thereabout and whereby an opening in the frame can be masked immediately above the burner tube, or unmasked at least in part, by a reflector in the forn: of at least two plates each hinged or pivoted for movement about an axis spaced within the opening. an embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: fig. 1 is a front perspective view of a gas cooker embodying a burner unit according to the present invention with reflector plates in the unmasking position. fig. 2 illustrates the burner unit with one reflector plate in the masking position; fig. 3 illustrates the burner unit with both reflector plates in the masking position; fig. 4 illustrates a reflector plate and fig. 5 illustrates the gas cooker in a collapsed transportable position. referring to the drawings, a gas cooker 10 in the form of an infra-red rotisserie includes one burner unit 12 mounted above a spit arrangement 13. the infra-red rays for cooking articles on the spit s provided by the burner unit 12 which includes a rectangular platform or frame 14 having a rectangular opening 15 therein and centrally thereof. a burner tube 16 is mounted on brackets under the frame 14 parallelwith the longer sides thereof, and below the mid-way longitudinal axis of the frame so as to divide the
