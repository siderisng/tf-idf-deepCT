<ABSTRACT>
an inductive sensor assembly for use on a ground  vehicle to provide signals representing deviations of the  vehicle from a reference path defined by a current-carrying-guidewire.   the assembly includes: a plurality of coils (l1,  l2, l3, l4, l5, l6) arranged in a predetermined pattern,  each of the coils (l1, l2, l3, l4, l5, l6) providing a respective  voltage which varies in accordance with horizontal  displacement of the coil from the guidewire, and means for  combining the voltages to provide a first signal which is  proportional to the heading of the vehicle independent of  lateral displacement and means for combining the voltages  to provide a second signal proportional to the lateral displacement  of the vehicle independent of heading.
