<ABSTRACT>
to detect tampering of a kilowatt-hour meter by the conÂ­ nection of a bypass link 35 across the live connection 15  through the meter, the live connection, within the meter unit  10, is coupled to a voltage transformer 22 so that a small  voltage is induced in the live connection in opposition to the  supply voltage.  the induced voltage produces a circulating  current in the loop formed by the live connection and the  bypass link and the transformer coupling is such that, with a  bypass link of negligible resistance, the total current in the live  connection is in opposite phase to the applied voltage.  by  means of a current transformer 23, a logic unit 20 and a  microprocessor 21, the phase of the current in connection 15  is determined and indicated by a latched flag indicator 38  and/or transmitted to a distant data processor by a data link  29,30,31.  using a second current transformer 40 in the return  supply lead, the supply and return currents in the leads within  the meter unit can be compared in the logic unit 20 and  processor 21 to determine if the live connection is broken  within the bypassed length.  by means of contacts 45, 46 on  the housing, indication is given if the housing of the unit has  been opened.
