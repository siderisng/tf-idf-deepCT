<ABSTRACT>
an athletic sock, particularly suitable for jogging and  running, is provided with terry loop shock absorber cushions  in the heel and ball areas (11,15) for protecting and cushioning  the heel and ball areas of the foot of the wearer.  relatively  lesser terry loop density is provided in the arch area (16) to  reduce the shock normally imparted to the arch of the foot of  the wearer so that normal articulation of the bones in the foot  takes place when the wearer is jogging and running.  the  shock absorber cushions are formed by providing a greater  density of terry loops in the heel and ball areas (11,15) of the  sock than the density of terry loops in the arch area (16) to  enhance the cushioning provided in the heel and ball areas  (11,15).
