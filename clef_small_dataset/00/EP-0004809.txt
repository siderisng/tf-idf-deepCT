<ABSTRACT>
in a cleaning device for a belt (1) of an endless conveyor belt, independent scrapers (4, 5) are connected to a support member (6) via elastic elements.  to eliminate the risks of breakage of the elastic elements, to ensure that the scrapers (4, 5) are permanently maintained in contact with the belt (1), and consequently to avoid any adjustment of the said scrapers during operation, the elastic elements consist of fibreglass rods (7, 8), means (31 to 50) being provided so as to adjust the position of the support member (6) for the rods (7, 8).  <image>
