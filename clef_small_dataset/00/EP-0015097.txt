<ABSTRACT>
a crate 1 for bottles with cylindrical body portions has  double-skinned corner portions 7 which define with portions  13 of an internal partitioning grid 5 corner compartments 6a  for bottles.  the inner skin 12 of the corner portion is formed  with vertical ribs 14 adjacent the grid portions 13.  these ribs,  which are interconnected with the outer skin 8 of the corner  portion to form hollow columns 14a therewith, strengthen the  corner portions and allow the spacing of the skins thereof to  be reduced so that the size of the compartment can be  increased for given external crate dimensions, and as the ribs  are located adjacent the partitioning portions 13 they occupy  space which would otherwise be free and do not reduce the  effective size of the corner compartments.

<DESCRIPTION>
crates. this invention relates to crates, and more particularly to substantially rectangular crates for a plurality of articles, such as bottles, having cylindrical body portions. it is known to employ double-skinned side walls in such crates to provide increased structural strength. this, however, has the disadvantage of reducing the useful interior cross-sectional area of the crate for a given external cross-sectional area thereof.. this disadvantage is particularly significant where an increase in the external side dimensions of the crate is undesirable for example because the crates are required to be stackable on a pallet of given dimensions. in order to reduce this disadvantage the present invention includes a substantially rectangular crate for a plurality of articles having cylindrical body portions, said crate having a base and side wall means and being provided with an internal partitioning grid, said side wall means including corner portions, each of which defines with adjacent mutually perpendicularly extending portions of the partitioning grid a compartment for one of said articles and includes adjacent each of said partitioning grid portions a hollow column extending vertically relative to said base. this invention also includes a substantially rectangular crate for a plurality of articles having cylindrical body portions, said crate having a base and side wall means and being provided with an internal partitioning grid, said side wall means including doubleskinned corner portions, each of which defines with adjacent mutually perpendicularly extending portions of the partitioning grid a compartment for one of said articles and comprises an outer skin having mutually perpendicular portions and an inner skin spaced from said outer skin and formed adjacent each of said partitioning grid portions with a rib extending away from the outer skin and vertically relative to said base. it will be understood that the columns or ribs of the corner portions strengthen the corner portions1 and thereby allow the spacing apart of the inner and outer skins at locations other than adjacent the grid partitioning portions to be correspondingly reduced, but by being formed adjacent the partitioning grid portions can be dimensioned so as to be spaced from the body portions of articles in the compartments of the crate. in order that the invention may be better understood, an embodiment thereof, which is given by way of example only, will now be described, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 shows a bottle crate, the right hand side of the figure being a bottom plan view and the left hand side of the figure being a part-sectioned top plan view, the section being taken along the line a-a of figure 2; figure 2 is a part-sectioned side elevation of the same crate, the section being taken along the line b-b of figure 1; figure 3 is a part-sectioned end elevation of the same crate, the section being taken along the line @ c of figur@ @. in the drawings there is illustrat@d a substan @a@l@ re@@angular @ fur a pluralit@ of bottles (not shown) having cyl@ndr@cal
