<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus comprises for example four microphones (m1-m4) connected to a phase changing system (d) driven by an address system (14) so as to delay certain of the electrical signals generated by certain of the microphones, by amounts which are specified and stored in a memory (15), so as to phase balance the components of the signals emitted by the microphones which correspond to sounds coming from the relevant location, so as to amplify these components in an adder circuit (a).  the invention applies in particular to the soundproofing of conference halls.  <image>
