<ABSTRACT>
a device for transferring and selectively for designing an image on a light-sensitive recording material, in which device in a manner which is simple in terms of construction and operation to achieve an optimal possibility of design and application, a device (4, 26, 21, 19) for designing a starting image is combined with a photographic recording device (35) which is sealed in a light-tight manner, so that a pick-off device (28) which is manually operable with easy action and the pick-off movements of which are transmissible via a lever and rod transmission device (12) without play, through an easily movable light seal (10), into the inner space (11a) of the recording chamber (11), and that a light source (15), which is independent thereof and disposed outside the recording chamber, with a device controlling the light intensity automatically as a function of the speed of the pick- off movement, is provided, the light signals of which are transmissible via a light guide (14) to a light exit head (16) fitted to the transmission device (12) within the recording chamber in the image plane (d).  <image>
