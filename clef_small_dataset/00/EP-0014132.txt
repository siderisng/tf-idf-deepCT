<ABSTRACT>
End cap device forming a pneumatic spring cylinder base or analog telescopic apparatus and allowing the longitudinal penetration of a plunger rod in this cylinder with seal provided by a joint having a lip surrounding with sliding friction the said rod and being sandwiched between a first annular piece of maintenance on the outside and acting as a mechanical guide for said rod and on the other hand a second annular part of the interior side and acting as a reserve of Oil for the lubrication of said seal lip, characterized in that said first annular holding piece is designed and arranged to allow a relative motion of rotulum of the apparatus under RA coupons applied to the drought rod. 2. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said first annular holding piece is carried out in an acetal resin (formaldehyde polymer) designated under the brand "Delrin", thus conferring the desired flash faculty. 3. Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said first annular holding piece has a plurality of recesses formed in its body and properly distributed around the axis to confer the desired pantling.
