<ABSTRACT>
1.  a regulating unit for rotary or lifting drive mechanisms of a crane, in particular for ships, wherein, at the end of an inner spar (4) which may be rotated about a swivel joint (3) there is arranged an outer spar (11) which may be rotated about a swivel joint (10) and which possesses a loading apparatus (19), wherein the drive mechanisms (5, 6, 7 ; 13, 14, 15) of the inner spar and the outer spar are equipped with an angle of rotation regulating device (25, 31) which, in order to determine the angle of rotation (gamma) of the inner spar (4) relative to a reference line (9), possesses a theoretical value generator (24) which is provided with a control lever (23) and whose output signal (gammasoll ) is used for adjustment of the angle of rotation (epsilon) of the inner spar (4), being conducted to a regulator (25) for the rotary drive mechanism of the inner spar (4), and is used for the adjustment of the angle (gamma) of the outer spar (11) relative to the inner spar (4), being conducted to a function generator (30) which serves to form a theoretical angle value (epsilonsoll ) which is dependent upon the angle of rotation (gamma) and the course of the transport path(s) and which, in order to determine the angle (epsilon) between the inner spar (4) and the outer spar (11), is fed to a further regulator (31) for the rotary drive mechanism of the outer spar (11), characterized in that a component (100) followed by a computer (70, 69) is arranged between the theoretical value generator (24) provided with the control lever (23) and the function generator (30), wherein, in the component (100) an output signal (+v. t) is formed which constantly increases in accordance with a predetermined and in particular linear function in dependence upon the time (t) from the output voltage which is emitted from the theoretical value generator (24) and is assigned to the deflection of the control lever (23), so that the computer (70, 69) calculates the time curve of the angle of rotation theoretical value (gammasoll ) between the inner spar (4) and a reference line (9) and in dependence upon the output signal (+v. t) of the component (100), upon the length (r) of the inner and outer spar between their centres of rotation, upon the distance (y8) of the load path (s) from the inner centre of rotation of the inner spar (4), and upon the vertical distance (xa ) of the load (20) from the reference line (9) at the beginning of each transportation process.
