<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a compressed gas switch which can be used as a high voltage circuit breaker in power supply networks. The compressed gas switch has two fixed nozzle-shaped switching pieces (2, 3) which can be bridged in the switch-on position by a hollow cylindrical movable counter (5). The switch further includes a blowing device consisting of a piston (6) and a movable cylinder (7), which compresses extinguishing gas in the course of the switch-off movement and by the annular gap formed by the slots (2, 3) in the region of the separation path in the interior of the switching pieces (2, 3) drives. In order to achieve the largest possible dielectric strength of the separation path and in particular to achieve an improvement of the switching behavior in capacitive currents, it is provided according to the invention that a the flow cross-section between the fixed slots (2, 3) of the annular insulating material body (8) has an axial extent, The less than the length (a) of the separation path is between the fixed slots (2, 3) and is arranged approximately in the middle between the cylinder bottom (9) and the free end (10) of the movable switching piece (5).
