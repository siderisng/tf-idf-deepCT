<ABSTRACT>
a class of substituted amino pyridine derivatives are of  value in the treatment of diabetes.  some of the compounds  also possess hypolipidaemic activity.  the compounds are represented by the formula (i):    wherein r³ is hydrogen, alkyl or an acidic function;   r² is hydrogen or alkyl;   r⁴ and r⁵ are hydrogen, alkyl or halogen;   z is hydrogen, phenyl, alkyl or aralkyl;   alk is alkylene and x is 0 or 1;   r¹ is optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl.  most of the compounds of formula (i) are novel.
