<ABSTRACT>
a single continuous length of spring wire (10) is formed  into a continuous length spiral or helix which is subsequently  folded into a wave configuration for establishing in row form,  a plurality of individual spring coils (12) disposed generally  parallel one to another.  each coil in the row is connected at its  opposite ends to adjacent coils by head or connector end  sections.  the head or connector end sections.  the head or  connector end sections (14) are then formed, preferably into a  planar z-shaped configuration such that the formed connector  sections (14) at the same ends of the coils are disposed in a  common plane normal to the axes of the coils which they  interconnect.  during forming of the end sections or heads of  the coils, each connector section is deformed from a looped  three-dimensional attitude into the planar z-shaped attitude  by interengagement with novel forming pins and forming  dies.
