<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for testing a sample of fibres or fila足 ments including a scanning zone (50) in which said sample  is located and scanning means (52).  transport means is  provided for producing relative movement between the  scanning zone (50) and the scanning means (52) whereby  to define a primary scan path therebetween.  the scanning  means includes irradiation means (9) arranged to irradiate  a portion of the scanning zone, and at least one radiation  detector (57) responsive to the irradation whereby to pro足 vide an output indicating the presence or otherwise of a  discrete length of fibre or filament in the portion and pro足 cessing means for processing the detector output to pro足 vide a measure of one or more parameters of the sample.
