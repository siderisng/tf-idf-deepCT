<ABSTRACT>
tobacco containing solid carbon dioxide is fed into  an expansion chamber (14) in which it is expanded by hot  gas; the solid carbon dioxide thereby being sublimed and  moisture and organic material in the tobacco being volata­ lised.  the gas and expanded tobacco enter a separator  (15) from which the tobacco is discharged through a rotary  valve (17).  gas is withdrawn from the separator (15), a  portion of it vented, and the remainder heated by heater  (27) and then returned to the expansion chamber (14).  in  order substantially to preclude air flowing through the ro­ tary valve (17) into the separator (15) the pressures below  and above the rotary valve are equalised.  alternatively,  some of the gas withdrawn from the chamber (15) my be  used to isolate the valve (17) from the atmosphere.  by  precluding air flow into the separator (15) the tobacco  may be expanded without using steam (other than that  evolved from the tobacco) or excessive temperatures.
