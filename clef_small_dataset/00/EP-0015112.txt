<ABSTRACT>
a system such as a multiprocessor parcel postage meter­ ing system includes a system processor to which a scale  subsystem processor, a postage printing subsystem   proces­ sor and a peripherals subsystem processor may be con­ nected.  the processors share a common data bus over which  data is transferred serially.  the system processor accepts  weight and status data transmitted from the scale subsystem  processor over the serial data bus.  the system processor  operates on this data and data entered by keyboard to calcu­ late required postage as a function of parcel origin, parcel  destination, class of service and selected special fees.  printer  setting data is transferred to the postage printing subsystem  processor over the serial data bus.  peripheral devices, such as  a document printer or a parcel identification number counter,  are controlled by data sent to the peripherals subsystem pro­ cess over the serial data bus.  communication are control­ led by the system processor which initiates any inter­ processor data transfer by means of a control signal which is  interpreted by the addressed subsystem processor as a  demand for information.
