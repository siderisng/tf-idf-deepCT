<ABSTRACT>
a fluid pressure circuit protection valve is provided which  has a closure member biassed by a spring against a seat such  that the valve remains closed to protect other circuits supplies  from the same source from effects of appreciable leakage  from a circuit on the output side of the valve but wherein the  spring is counteracted by a predetermined level of output  pressure, the closure member being provided with a small  path across it which is closed by resilent deformation due to  the spring but which is opened to permit restricted flow  through the valve to a service brake circuit reservoir which is  required to acquire a recharged condition prior to a parking  spring brake circuit despite the possibility of respective circuit  protection valves not being identically biassed.
