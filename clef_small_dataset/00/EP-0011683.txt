<ABSTRACT>
this invention pertains to a control valve (14) having a  double-acting kick-out member (36) attached to an end of a  spool (33) thereof to return the spool (33) to a neutral position  after actuation thereof.  the invention is particularly useful in a  fluid control circuit wherein the control valve (14) is adapted to  selectively communicate pressurised fluid to an actuator,  such as a double-acting hydraulic cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
control valve with double-acting kick-out means technical field this invention relates to a double-acting kick-out member adapted to be attached to an end of a spool of a directional control valve to return the spool, in response to fluid pressure, to a neutral position subsequent to actuation thereof. it is desirable in fluid control circuits of the type including a directional control valve for selectively actuating a double-acting cylinder to return the spool of the control valve to a neutral position once the desired fluid pressure has been established in either end of the cylinder. the cylinder may be of the type employed on a construction vehicle for selectively moving a ripper attachment thereon. for example, once the cylinder has been pressurized, to lower the ripper into the ground for ripping purposes or to fully raise the ripper to clear the ground and obstacles thereon, it is desirable to automatically move the spool of the control valve to a neutral position to trap such fluid pressure in the ripper cylinder. this kickout feature is partciuarly useful since the operator of the vehicle normally cannot see when the ripper is either fully lowered or raised. the movement of the spool of the control valve back to its neutral position, once the peak working pressure has been established in the cylinder and the ripper has been fully lowered or raised, is desirable to avoid overheating of the fluid circuit and to prevent having to run fluid through a relief valve thereof. in conventional control circuits of this type, a kick-out mechanism is either associated with each end of the spool of the control valve or is separated from the control valve as a separate unit to thus provide a somewhat complex and bulky valve package and associated lines and fluid passages. furthermore, kick-out mechanisms of this type require close calibration to achieve the kick-out function. disclosure of the invention the present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above. in one aspect of this invention, a valve arrangement comprises a reciprocal spool movable through at least first, second and third positions and kick-out means at an end of the spool for returning the spool to its second position after it has been moved to each of its first and third positions. in another aspect of this invention, the kick-out means comprises a member attached to an end of the spool for simultaneous movement therewith. in still another aspect of this invention, the valve arrangement comprises a directional control valve employed in a fluid control circuit and connected to a pressurized fluid source and to a fluid actuator for selectively operating the actuator. the above kick-out means thus solves the problem of returning the spool to its second or neutral position while yet providing a non-complex and compact valve arrangement which may be closely calibrated to provide the above-mentioned desiderata. brief description of the drawings other objects of this invention will become apparent from the following
