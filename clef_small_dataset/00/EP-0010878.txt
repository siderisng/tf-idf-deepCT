<ABSTRACT>
cord guide, such as a pulley (22), and support (2)  therefore, for use with a liftable shade or blind, such as a  roman shade or a venetian blind.  a pivotally suspended  cord guide support (2) for use with a liftable shade sus足 pends the cord guide (22) in a pivotal manner, so that the  pull cords may be held for operation at a substantial angle  with respect to the wall without diminishing their effective足 ness in operating the shade.  the cord guide (22) is sup足 ported within a clevislike structure (2) which has a spe足 cially constructed head end (32, 33) adapted for pivotal  support (11, 32 and 12, 33) on and by a ceiling or wall  attachable bracket (1).  thus, the support (2) and the cord  guide (22) thereby, while normally hanging parallel with  the wall, can be angled away from it to permit greater ease  in pulling of the shade cords, but without diminishing the  accuracy or effectiveness of the cords in the operating of  the shade.
