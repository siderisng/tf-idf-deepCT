<ABSTRACT>
novel esters of formula i wherein r¹ is trifluoromethyl,  chloro, bromo or fluoro, r² is hydrogen, cyano or methyl  and r is a halophenyl group bearing up to five halogen  atoms at least one of which is fluoro, and compositions  comprising them, useful as insecticides.  the compounds of  formula i may be prepared by conventional esterification  procedures.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to novel cyclopropane derivatives useful as insecticides, to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them and to methods of combating insect and similar invertebrate pests using them. certain naturally occurring esters of cyclopropane carboxylic acids have long been known to possess insecticidal properties, but these compounds have been too easily degraded by ultra violet light to be of much use in agriculture. several groups of synthetic compounds based on cyclopropane carboxylic acids (for example those disclosed in british patent specifications nos 1,243,858 and 1,413,491 ) have been evaluated in an attempt to discover compounds of sufficient light stability for use as general agricultural insecticides. a particularly useful group of such compounds is that disclosed in british patent specification no 2,000,764 and belgian patent no 863,151. these compounds combine good light stability with excellent contact and residual insecticidal properties, but, in common with the compounds described in british patent specifications 1.243,858 and 1,413,491, they possess little or no fumigant activity. a further group of compounds, halobenzyl esters of 3-(2,2-dihalovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acids, is described in belgian patent 862,109 as having insecticidal properties but there is no indication that the compounds possess fumigant activity. european patent application no ep-a-8340 (which forms part of the state of the art for the present invention by virtue of articles 54(3) and 54(4) epc) discloses unspecified mixtures of cis- and trans-isomers of the pentafluorobenzyl esters of 3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-en-1-yl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid and 3-(2-bromo-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-en-1-yl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid. the present invention relates to certain novel halobenzyl esters of 3-(2-halo(or trifluoromethyl)-3,3,3-trifluorophenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acids with an extremely with an extremely high level of insecticidal and acaricidal activity which may be used not only as contact or residual insecticides but also as fumigant insecticides. accordingly this invention provides α compound of formula:― wherein r¹ is chloro, bromo, fluoro or trifluoromethyl, r² is hydrogen, methyl or cyano, and r is a halophenyl group bearing at least one flurorine atom, provided that where r is pentafluorophenyl and r² is hydrogen r¹ may not be chloro or bromo. preferably r is a tetrahalophenyl or pentahalophenyl group in which at least four fluorine atoms are present, for example one of the following groups 2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl 2,3,4,6-tetrafluorophenyl 4-chloro-2,3,5-trifluorophenyl 4-chloro-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl 4-bromo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl pentafluorophenyl. however compounds of formula i in which r represents a halophenyl group containing from 1 to 3 fluorine atoms also have useful insecticidal properties. particular compounds according to the invention as defined by formula i above include those set out in table i herein in which the meanings for r¹, r² and r are given for each compound. it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds represented by formula i are capable of existing in various geometrical and stereoisomeric forms. thus there may be cis and trans isomers arising from the substitution pattern of the cyclopropane ring, and e- and z-isomers arising from the substituted vinyl group when r¹ is not trifluoromethyl. in addition two of the three carbon atoms of the cyclopropane are capable of existing in either r- or s-configurations since
