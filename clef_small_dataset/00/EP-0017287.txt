<ABSTRACT>
a closure treatment machine having one or more  caskets (1) for holding the closures (9); said caskets comprise  a number of parallel bars (2, 3, 4), which are connected at  both ends to each other by coupling plates (5, 6), whereby  the parallel bars are arranged in such a way that the closures  are held between said bars but still do have such a tolerance,  that the cleansing liquid sprayed from nozzles (23) towards  the closures may reach any side of the closures.  for filling  and emptying the caskets at least one of the coupling plates  has an opening (7, 8) for passing the closures.  the caskets  which are moved by means of chains (16) may be led after a  cleansing station to a drying station or a sterilization station.
