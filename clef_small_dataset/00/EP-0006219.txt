<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for storing amount of mener energy by means of a crystallization roller (11) overlooking the availability of heat energy, which is expensive or due to undesirable temperature levels (eg solar energy), whereby the heat storage is carried out with TELS crystallization or fusion and the crystallization delay in The manner is caused that the nucleus of crystallization is generated by a continuous mechanical action, in which a primary, heat-emitting carrier fluid converts a frozen storage medium (6) into the liquid state (13) by heat exchange and by supply of meltwear Me and a Secondary carrier fluid discloses heat after desired, by which this liquid is in the desired circumference a conventional, partly with its circumference in the molten memory medium (13), flows through, rotating crystallization roller (11) and the memory meter dium Freezing the walls of the roller (11), where the frozen storage medium (9) is brought into contact with the primary trough fluid by the rotational movement of the roller for the purpose of heat exchange.
