<ABSTRACT>
a heat storing fireplace including a fire-box (14) surrounded  by a heat storage medium which is either an  enclosure (18) containing a material (20) having a high  specific heat such as sand or gravel or a large number of heat  conducting bags containing a high specific heat material.   exhaust gases are conveyed from the fire-box (14) to an  exhaust outlet (24) by several conduits (22) extending  through the heat storage medium in a circuitous path in  order to transfer heat from the exhaust gases to the heat  storage medium.  heat is further distributed through the storage  material by a heat conducting lattice (26) fastened to the  conduits (22) and extending through the storage medium in  a circuitous path.  combustion air enters the bottom of the  fire box (14) through a combustion air inlet jacket (28) surrounding  the exhaust outlet (24) in order to simultaneously  prewarm the combustion air while thermally insulating the  exhaust outlet (24) from its support structure.  a draft is created  through the fire-box (14) by an exhaust fan (32)  mounted in the exhaust outlet (24).  although the heat storage  medium is primarily heated by burning fuel in the fire-box  (14), it may also be heated by either an electric grill or  solar heat exchanger embedded in the heat storage medium.   the upper portion of the storage medium is covered by a  ventilating plenum (38) which allows heat to escape from the  enclosure (18).  the plenum (38) has a pair of ventilated  sidewalls (40, 42) separated from each other by a baffle (44).   a fan (48), which may be thermostatically controlled, is  positioned in an opening in the baffle in order to selectively  produce air flow through the plenum (38).  heat in the storage  medium may also be utilized by placing a hot water heating  heat exchanger in the storage medium.
