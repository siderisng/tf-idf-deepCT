<ABSTRACT>
simplified type of skirt adaptable to all vehicles or objects to be moved on a cushion of air, formed on blocks level with the vehicle.  this skirt consists of a piece of fabric (1) laid flat and stretched out over wooden blocks (4) arranged temporarily at the corners of the perimeter of the base of the object or vehicle to be moved (3), these blocks being of the desired depth of the skirt.  the fabric is then draped around the blocks and folded up and fastened to the perimeter of the base of the vehicle or object to be moved.  the bag thus formed is opened over an area cut out from its horizontal portion following the perimeter of the base but with rounded corners and of a smaller diameter than the perimeter of the base.  this gives a peripheral skirt with concave walls and a stable geometry.  the invention may be used to move, on a cushion of air, toys or handling pallets or for moving exceptional objects (houses, containers).  <image>
