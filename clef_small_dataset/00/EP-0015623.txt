<DESCRIPTION>
title magnesium compositions and process for forming mgo film technical field this invention relates to magnesium compositions which are useful for screen printing and pyrolysis to form an mgo film. background art m. o. aboelfotoh and j. a. lorenzen, "influence of secondary-electron emission from mgo surfaces on voltage-breakdown curves in penning mixtures for insulated-electrode discharges",j.appl.phys., vol.48, no 11, 4754-4759 (1977) discloses the formation of a mgo film on the surface of an a-c plasma display panel by sputtering, which involves use of an electron gun to volatilize a magnesium compound and then deposit it as a mgo film on the surface of the panel to a thickness of o about 3000 a. the disadvantage of this method of forming the mgo film is that sputtering is expensive. disclosure of invention the present invention provides a more economical method of forming an mgo film and a composition there for. the composition of the present invention is a screen printable syrup comprising organic solvent, organic magnesium compound soluble in the solvent, and organic polymer thickener soluble in- the solvent. solution of the organic polymer thickener in the solvent thickens the solution so that it is syrup-like in consistency at ordinary room temperature (200c). the components of the syrup are selected so that the syrup is pyrolyzable to form a transparent, colorless mgo filmy the process of the invention is conducted by screen printing of the syrup onto the desired surface, followed by pyrolyzing the syrup to form the mgo film on the surface. this process is useful in place of sputtering to form an mgo film on the surface of an a-c plasma display panel. further description of the invention and best mode the composition of the present invention contains three essential ingredients, organic magnesium compound, organic solvent and organic polymer thickener. the criteria for selecting these ingredients and preferred ingredients are set forth hereinafter. the organic magnesium compound is selected so that it is pyrolyzable to mgo film and is. soluble in the organic solvent used at ordinary room temperature. selection of the organic magnesium compound can be subject to the pyrolysis temperature that can be used. for example, current surfaces of a-c plasma displays are made- of lead-rich glass which undergoes a glass transition at a temperature above 450at. to avoid this transition, it is preferred that the organic magnesium compound is pyrolyzable to mgo film at a temperature up to 450as, examples of magnesium organic compounds that can be used are the oxygen-containing organic magnesium compounds such as magnesium carboxylates, e.g., magnesium cyclohexanebutyrate, magnesium diketones, e.g., magnesium acetylacetonate, and magnesium alcoholates, e.g magnesium. ethoxide.. preferably all the atoms bonded to the magnesium atom in the compound are oxygen atoms and organic carbon atoms are bonded to these oxygen atoms. the organic solvent component is selected so as to dissolve the remaining components of the syrup and to depart from the syrup without leaving any detectable residue during pyrolysis. typically, most or all of the solvent will evaporate in a
