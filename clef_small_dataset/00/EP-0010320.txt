<ABSTRACT>
new and pharmacologically useful 3β-amino-2β­ -hydroxy steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane  series are disclosed having the formula i:    and pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid addition salts  of these compounds, wherein:   (a) r₁ is h, alkyl of one to six carbons (preferably lower alkyl,  such as methyl), or acyl of one to eighteen carbons;   (b) r₂ is h or acyl of one to eighteen carbons;   (c) r₃ is h or methyl, preferably methyl;   (d) y is selected from the group consisting of o, acetalized o,  h(βor₄), r₅(βor₄), h(βcoch₃) and h(βchor₄ch₃);   (e) r₄ is h or acyl of one to eighteen carbons; nd   (f) r₅ is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl group of one to four  carbons;   as well as pharmaceutically acceptable compositions com­ prising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of  the above formula, and a pharmaceutically effective carrier.   the novel compounds have anti-arrhythmic properties, have  no or minimal and transient haemodynamic effects, have no  local anaesthetic properties and do not cause cns stimula­ tion.  the compounds also have prophylactic effect and  decrease infarctsize.

<DESCRIPTION>
novel 32,-amino-2ss-hydroxy steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions. this invention relates to novel 3ss-amino-2ss-hydroxy steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series and derivatives thereof, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds as active component. in british specification 1 108 563 amino steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series are described, having a hydroxyl or acyloxy group in 2ss-position and a tertiary amino group in 3a-position. some of these compounds have been found to possess anti-arrhythmic activity. however, at therapeutic dose levels these compounds also exhibit undesirable activities, such as convulsant activity and local anaesthetic activity which precludes their clinical application. in british specification 1 439 605 amino steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series are described, having a hydroxyl or acyloxy group in 25-position and a primary amino group in 3a-position. these compounds have anti-arrhythmic properties and are virtually devoid of convulsant and local anaesthetic activities surprisingly, it was found that novel steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series, substituted in 2b-position with a hydroxyl or acyloxy group, and in the 3p-position with a primary or secondary amino group, are potent anti-arrhythmic agents. therefore, the present invention relates to novel steroids of the androstane, oestrane and pregnane series having the formula i: emi2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic addition salts thereof, wherein: (a) r1 is h, alkyl of one to six carbons (preferably lower alkyl, such as methyl), or acyl of one to eighteen carbons; (b) r2 is h or acyl of one to eighteen carbons; (c) r3 is h or methyl, preferably methyl; (d) y is selected from the group consisting of 0, acetalized 0, h(ssor4), r5((30r4), h(sscoch3) and h(sschor4ch3)i (e) r4 is h or acyl of one to eighteen carbons; and (f) r5 is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl group of one to four carbons, as well as compositions containing a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more compounds of formula i. a special group of compounds is the group having the formula ii: emi3.1 wherein: (a) r6 is h or methyl; (b) r7 is h or lower alkanoyl of one to four carbons; and (c) 2 is 0, acetalized 0, or h(or8), wherein r8 = h or lower alkanoyl of one to four carbons; and acid addition salts and n-acetyl derivatives of these compounds. preferably, r7 is h and z is 0. as stated above, the novel compounds have antiarrhythmic properties, have no or minimal and transient haemodynamic effects, have no local anaesthetic activity and do not cause cns-stimulation. they also have prophylactic effect and decrease infarctsize. the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by methods employing steps known to those in the art. for example, one may start from the corresponding 3n-azido-2p-hydroxy compound. the 3a-azido-2b-hydroxy compound is first oxidized to give the corresponding 2-oxo-3n-azide, for example with cro3, preferably in the form of the complex piridinium chlorochromate in buffered solution, then the 3n-azido group is epimerized to
