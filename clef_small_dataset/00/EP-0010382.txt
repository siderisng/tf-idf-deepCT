the use of niobium or tantalum treated in a manner  known per se by pickling and anodisation as a connector in a  saline solution.  also an electrical connector formed of  niobium or tantalum having been treated by pickling and  oxidation.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
use of treated niobium or tantalum as a connector and such a connector this invention relates to the use of treated niobium or tantalum as a connector and such a connector and has particular reference to the treatment of niobium or tantalum to improve its resistance to a previously unknown crevice corrosion attack. it has already been proposed to use niobium as a connector, particularly for use in a saline solution such as seawater. such a connector is described in detail in british published application no 2 001 807a. niobium is chosen as a particularly suitable material for such a connector for a number of reasons. the purpose of the connector is to permit a dismantlable connection to be made in an electrical : line feeding positive current to an underseas anode in an impressed current cathodic protection system. the electrical connector proposed in patent specification no 2 001 807a has a number of distinct advantages over pre#vious electrical connectors in that it is easily dismantlable and assemblable and by comparison to previous connectors is comparatively inexpensive. niobium is chosen as a particularly suitable material for such an electrical connector as it is normally recognised that niobium can be connected and operated as an anode in a saline solution, such as seawater, without corroding at anodic voltages less than approximately 100 volts. the anodic properties of niobium are well-known and it is well-known that niobium forms a resistant and insulating niobium oxide film at applied voltages of up to 100 volts. above that voltage, known as the breakdown voltage, the film fails and the material corrodes rapidly. before the present invention, however, it was considered that bulk niobium was self-passivating at voltages below the breakdown voltage. unexpectedly, however, it was found that when connectors formed of niobium were tested they could, in certain conditions, corrode rapidly. why this should happen was not to be found in any literature known to the applicants. an answer to the problem has now been found and basically the solution, which forms one feature of the present invention, is to pre-treat the niobium by pickling to remove contamination and surface oxide films and subsequently to form an oxide film on the surface of the niobium. as a result of investigations carried out by the applicants it has been found that such a pre-treatment is known per se but has only been proposed as a method of forming a smooth surface, for example in the treatment of superconductor cavity resonators. thus, in british patent specification no 1 335 165 there is described the treatment of the internal niobium surface of a superconducting cavity resonator by pickling in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid and subsequently anodising the resonator surface in an aqueous ammonia solution. there is no indication, however, from this prior patent specification that the material so treated is particularly suitable for use as a connector in a saline solution or that such a material would be resistant to corrosion. it is apparent,
