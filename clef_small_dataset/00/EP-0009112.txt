<ABSTRACT>
in the device for braking a vehicle colliding with an obstacle by means of hydraulic damping forces and pneumatic spring forces, an internal tube (1) closed off by a floor (2) has, beginning successively from the floor (2) a gas space (3) which receives a gas cushion of high pressure, a dividing piston (4) guided sealingly and displaceably in the internal tube (1), a first liquid space (6), a partition wall (7) fixed in the internal tube (1) and provided with throttle orifices (8), and at one end of a piston rod (15) a working piston (12) sealed with respect to the internal shell of the internal tube (1), the piston rod (15) emerging from the internal tube (1) and its other end being connected to a floor (17) of an external tube (18) guided displaceably on the internal tube (1).  for the purpose of a problem-free determination of the initial state while simultaneously increasing the effectiveness of the surface of the internal tube (1) for the build-up of the gas forces, the working piston (12) is impermeable, the piston rod (15) emerges from the internal tube (1) in an unsealed and unguided manner and the initial position is determined by the immediate striking of the working piston (12) against internally directed projections (14) of the internal tube (1).  <image>
