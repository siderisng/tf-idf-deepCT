<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for opening a cassette, of the type which carries  a sheet of x-ray film, to allow the film to move into  processing equipment, without requiring a darkroom.  the  apparatus includes a lighttight housing containing inclined  guides for receiving the cassette, and pins at the bottom of  the space between the guides, that can engage latches on the  cassette to open it.  the cassette is forced against the pins by  a cover on the housing, which pushes on the cassette as the  cover approaches its fully closed position, so the pins  unlatch the cassette which opens to allow the film sheet to  drop out.
