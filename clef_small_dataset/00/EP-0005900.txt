<ABSTRACT>
conversion of raw coal to distillate liquid and gaseous  hydrocarbon products by solvent liquefaction in the presence  of molecular hydrogen employing recycle of mineral  residue is commonly performed at a higher thermal efficiency  than conversion of coal to pipeline gas in a gasification  process employing partial oxidation and methanation reactions.   the prior art has disclosed a combination coal  liquefaction-gasification plant employing recycle of mineral  residue to the liquefaction zone wherein all the normally  solid dissolved coal not converted to liquid or gaseous  products in the liquefaction zone is passed to a gasification  zone for conversion to hydrogen.  in the prior art plant the  amount of normally solid dissolved coal passed to the  gasification zone is just sufficient to enable the gasification  zone to produce the entire process hydrogen requirement.   an unexpected improvement in thermal efficiency has now  been achieved by increasing the amount of normally solid  dissolved coal from the liquefaction zone (26) and passed to  the gasification zone (76) to an amount sufficient to enable  the gasification zone (76) to generate not only all of the  hydrogen required by the liquefaction zone (26) but also to  produce synthesis gas, and adapting the plant to utilize all or  a significant amount of this synthesis gas as fuel in the plant.  it would have been expected that shifting some of the  processing load from the ordinarily more efficient liquefaction  zone (26) to the ordinarily less efficient gasification zone  (76) would decrease process efficiency, but the present  invention unexpectedly achieves an overall efficiency increase  by said shift by modifying the plant to permit in-plant  combustion of the synthesis gas so produced.
