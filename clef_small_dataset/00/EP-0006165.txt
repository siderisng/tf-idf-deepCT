<ABSTRACT>
a charge electrode array for a multi-nozzle ink jet  array is fabricated from alternate layers of stainless steel  10 and epoxy resin 24.  the charge electrode array may be  formed by positioning the stainless steel tabs 18 in preÂ­ viously grooved nonconductive substrate 15 formed of  a material such as ceramic.  the grooves 15 are spaced  sufficiently apart to allow the insulating material 24 to be  placed between each stainless steel tab.  alternatively, a  stainless steel plate may be bonded to a nonconductive  substrate.  then the stainless steel can be sliced so that  insulating material can be placed between each stainless  steel strip.  the epoxy resin 24 fills the gap between tabs  or strips forming an insulating layer.  an ink drop charging  passage through each tab or strip is formed by cutting  u-shaped channels 16 through the tips of the tabs or strips,  or alternatively by drilling through the tips of the steel tabs  or strips.
