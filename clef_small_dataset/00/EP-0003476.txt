<ABSTRACT>
1.  a bending tool for manufacturing u-shaped workpieces, comprising a bending punch, which is preferably backed at its flanks and which is received between two bending jaws while driving a backing member, which ensures a surface contact between the workpiece and the bending punch, characterized in that the bending jaws (3) are succeeded in the direction of the working  stroke of the bending punch (1) by two additional jaws (5), which slidably bear on stationary wedge faces (6), which converge in the direction of the working stroke of the bending punch (1), and the backing member (2) comprises coupling elements (7) which serve to move the additional jaws (5) along the wedge faces, which additional jaws are held in an initial position near the bending jaws (3) at the beginning of the working stroke.
