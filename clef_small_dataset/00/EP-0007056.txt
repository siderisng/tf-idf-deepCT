<ABSTRACT>
microemulsion defoamer compositions which are oil in  water colloidal dispersions are useful in defoaming aqueous  systems such as in paper machines and latex paints.  these  compositions are prepared by mixing a water dispersible  organic material, ethylene oxide condensate, coupling agent,  water, basic material and antigelling agent.
