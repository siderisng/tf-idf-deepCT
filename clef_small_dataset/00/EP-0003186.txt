<ABSTRACT>
a moist packaged towelette comprises a sheet of  nonwoven fabric provided with a binder comprising polyvinyl  alcohol in contact with an aqueous solution in a  container.  the aqueous solution contains a sufficient concentration  of a compound which prevents the polyvinyl  alcohol dissolving in the aqueous solution but which, when  dissolved in excess water, allows the polyvinyl alcohol to  dissolve in the excess water thereby reducing the structural  integrity of the towelette.  suitable compounds include boric  acid and sodium sulphate.  the binder may consist of pure  polyvinyl alcohol or a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and  polyvinyl acetate.  a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl  acetate-ethylene copolymers and, if desired, polyvinyl acetate,  can also be used as a binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a moist packaged towelette and to a method of making the same. moist packaged towelettes are generally made by coating a sheet of nonwoven fabric, usually absorbent paper, with a binder and storing the coated fabric in contact with an aqueous solution in a container. the aqueous solution typically contains alcohol and, for example, a perfume or deodorant. the binder increases the structural integrity of the nonwoven fabric and prevents it disintegrating in the aqueous solution. (for the avoidance of doubt the term "nonwoven fabric" as used herein includes fabrics comprising carded or randomly orientated or cross-laid fibres. the fibres may comprise, for example, natural or regenerated cellulose, other synthetic or proteinaceous fibres of biodegrade materials, or mixtures of these). various binders have been proposed but all which are known to us have the disadvantage that the coated fabric maintains a high structural integrity even after prolonged exposure to water. this can result in blocked drains. one known binder for nonwoven fabrics which are not intended to be exposed to moisture is polyvinyl alcohol. whilst nonwoven fabrics provided with this binder have excellent structural integrity in the dry they disintegrate rapidly when immersed in water. we have discovered that a nonwoven fabric provided with a binder comprising polyvinyl alcohol will retain a high structural integrity in contact with an aqueous solution provided that the aqueous solution contains a sufficient concentration of a compound to prevent the polyvinyl alcohol dissolving in the aqueous solution. when the solution is diluted the polyvinyl alcohol dissolves thereby weakening the structural integrity of the towelette. accordingly, the present invention provides a moist packaged towelette comprising a sheet of nonwoven fabric provided with a binder and maintained in contact with an aqueous solution in a container characterized in that said binder is polyvinyl alcohol and said aqueous solution contains a compound which is present in said solution at a sufficient concentration to prevent said polyvinyl alcohol dissolving in said aqueous solution but which, when diluted in excess water, permits said polyvinyl alcohol to dissolve in said excess water thereby reducing the structural integrity of said towelette. compounds which will prevent polyvinyl alcohol dissolving in aqueous solutions are well known and examples are listed in polyvinyl alcohol", 1973; finch c.a., john wiley & br< sons ltd., table 2.3 at page 40. substantially all of these compounds (which comprise boric acid and water soluble salts) will, when dissolved in excess water, permit the polyvinyl alcohol to dissolve thereby reducing the structural integrity of the nonwoven fabric. it is, of course, a simple procedure to check if a particular compound is suitable. of the available compounds boric acid is presently preferred and preferably comprises at least 1% (by weight) of the aqueous solution with 3% to 5% (by weight) being preferred and 4% to 5% (by weight) being more preferred. one of the problems associated with using a water soluble salt as the compound is that the required concentration in the aqueous solution is so
