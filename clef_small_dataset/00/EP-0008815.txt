<ABSTRACT>
in a device for reserving a short length of film for rewinding when making double exposures in moving picture cameras, the film takeup spool (1) of which, being driven by the camera motor, is acted upon by a return lock for the takeup spool which prevents a rotation of the spindle in the direction required for the rewinding of the film, the film takeup spindle (1), which is driven in a manner known per se via a friction drive, is fixable during the first-time forward transport and preferably also during the subsequent rewinding of the film section to be subjected to double exposure, by means of an electrically controlled locking element (2, 3).  <image>
