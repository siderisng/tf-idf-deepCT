<ABSTRACT>
this invention is concerned with a business forms as足 sembly including a plurality of record sheets with inter足 leaved transfer sheets, preferably of carbon paper.  to enable  information inserted on to a sheet (12) to be easily ex足 tracted the information extraction sheet is printed in an  area (13) to receive relevant information with a background  colour contrasting with the colour of the transfer material  and is printed in an area (14) to receive irrelevant informa足 tion with a background colour corresponding to or not  contrasting with the colour of the transfer material.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention has reference to business forms assemblies which include a plurality of record sheets with interleaved transfer sheets usually of carbon paper. such business forms assemblies may be in the form of snop-out sets, continuous stationery assemblies, autographic register sets or check books snap-out set assemblies consist of a plurality of record sheets of which the top sheet is invariably the customer's copy and the underlying sheets correspond to the top sheet. each record sheet is divided into data recei ving areas so that the information recorded on an area on the top sheet by writing implements or typewriter type face is transferred to corresponding areas on the underlying sheets it is known to provide transfer sheets which are selectively coated and the record sheets and transfer sheets are so registered that the data applied to the top sheet is selectively transferred to the underlying sheets. it is also known to provide business forms stationery with coloured lines or blocks extending across the sheet to facilitate readirig of the information typed on the form, for example british patent specification no 1 447,965 describes a continuous business form in which the record sheets have printed on then a series of half tone continuous parallel bars of different colours and the bars form a repetitive pattern, whereby lines of characters printed on one bar will be clearly distinguished from a line of characters printed on other bars it is also known from british patent specification noo 1,501,623 to provide a business forms stationery printed with spaced groups of parallel blocks extending transversely of the web and a transverse line or lines between the groups of parallel blocks to assist the eye to follow the lines of recorded information across the web, it is usual to have one of the parts of the sets of business forms assemblies include a so-cal led ledger copy which is used by a computer input operator to extract information for entry into a computer. insofar as the computer is concerned some of the information included on the record sheet is relevant, some is irrelevant and some is useless, and the computer entry operator may have sonde difficulty in separating the relevant information from the irrelevant and/or useless information. it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved business forms assembly it is another object of the present invention to provide an improved business forms assembly embodying a part intended for extraction of inforrr,ation for computer entry, which part facilitates the reading of the form to enable easy extraction of information to be obtained. according to the present invention a business forms assembly comprises a plurality of record sheets with a transfer material between adjacent record sheets, each of the record sheets being divided into data receiving areas to receive information impressed on the business form assembly and the corresponding data receiving areas being in register with one another wherein at least one of the areas on at least one record sheet is intended

<CLAIMS>
 claims   a    a business forms assembly comprising a plurality of record sheets with a transfer material between adjacent record sheets, each of the record sheets being divided into data receiving areas to receive information impressed on the business form assembly and the corresponding data receiving areas being in register with one another, wherein at least one of the areas on at least one record sheet is intended for extraction of relevant information such as a computer entry and the transfer sheet from which transfer material transfers the relevant information is coloured,  and wherein the relevant information part comprises a background area contrasting with the colour of the transfer material to receive said relevant information and a background area corresponding to or not contrasting with the colour of the transfer material to receive irrelevant information.    2. a business forms assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein transfer material for transfer to a relevant information area is applied selectively to the transfer sheet, the transfer sheet and associated record sheets being aligned and arranged so that irrelevant and/or unimportant information applied to the top record sheet is not applied to selected copy record sheets.   3. a business forms assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the contrasting background area on a record sheet is of a colour contrasting with the colour of the record sheet in the remainder of the information receiving area thereof.     4. a business forms   assembly    substantially as hereinbefore described when having reference to the accompanying drawings.
