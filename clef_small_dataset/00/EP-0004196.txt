<ABSTRACT>
a bracket assembly comprises a tubular upright (1) having  a plurality of elongated slots (3) aligned in a vertical row  in the wall of the upright, and a bracket member (6) of substantially  flat construction mountable in the upright in contilever  fashion.  the bracket member has an anchoring portion  which engages in the upright and a contiguous portion  for supporting a load.  the anchoring portion includes undercut  projecting tongues (7) each of which engages a slot in the  upright.  each tongue is of such a length that when it is fully  located in the slot the undercut (16) receives a wall portion of  the upright adjacent the lower end of the slot and the free  end face (14) of the tongue abuts the inner surface of the wall  of the upright opposite to that containing the slot.
