<ABSTRACT>
a method of and apparatus for monitoring the operation  of a motor vehicle subjected to a decelerative force, wherein  the vehicle's throttle opening is sensed by first sensing  means in the form of electrical switches (252-1, 252-2) an  indication is given by an audible alarm (414) and a recorder  (412) when the throttle opening exceeds a predetermined  value, wherein the decelerative force is sensed by  second sensing means in the form of inclined mercury  switches (286-1, 286-2) wherein said predetermined value  is varied automatically as said decelerative force on the vehicle  varies, and wherein further the accelerative, decelerative  or centrifugal force on the vehicle in a plane parallel to  its supporting surface is sensed by sensing means in the  form of inclined mercury switches (604-1, 604-2), an indication  is given by an audible alarm (614) and a recorder  (622) when said force exceeds a predetermined value  irrespective of the throttle opening.
