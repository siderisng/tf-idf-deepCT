<ABSTRACT>
A wastewater ventilation basin of a sewage treatment plant has a sewer container (1) recessed in the soil (2) in the three perpendicular tubes (8) which connect the surface water of the container (1) with the soil water thereof. By conveying pumps (10), a downwardly directed flow (9) is generated in the tubes, so that the wastewater (21) reckolated in the container from bottom to top and in the pipes. In each tube (8), in the upper part of the same (12) means (13, 14) for fine-blister introduction of a vent gas (16, 17) are arranged. The flow rate (V) of the wastewater in the tube (8), immediately below this upper part (12), is larger than the buoyancy rate (Va) of the gas bubbles introduced into the flow (9) at the same location (20). Since the gas is not introduced into the wastewater in the soil zone (11) of the container, but in the upper part of the pipe, the gas pressure is lower than with direct introduction of the gas into the soil zone and the energy expenditure is smaller with high efficiency of ventilation.
