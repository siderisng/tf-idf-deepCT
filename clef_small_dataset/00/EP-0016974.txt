<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of the formula in which A represents for the -CO or CH (OH) group, R is alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl, X for halogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkyl, optionally substituted phenyl, caused by reassemblySubstituted phenoxy, optionally substituted phenylalkyl or optionally substituted phenylalkoxy is N for integers of 0 to 3 and M is 0 or 1, as well as their physiologically acceptable acid addition salts and metal salt complexes.Method for their preparation by reacting halogen pyridine ketones of the formula with phenols of the formula or by saturation of α, β-unsciented ketones of the formula and optionally by reducing the keto derivatives to the secondary alcohols.
