<ABSTRACT>
a die member model (22,24) is formed against a pattern  (12) and a restraining surface or a second model or die  member, and is separated from the pattern (12) by ejectors  (15,23).  the model (22,24) includes a reinforcement and is  strong enough to resist deformation during separation.   investment is applied to the model (22,24) to form a shell  mould which is then opened at a location remote from the  surface of the model (22,24) corresponding to the working  face of the die member.  the integrity of the model is desÂ­ troyed, the reinforcement remaining in non-fluid form, and  the model is removed through the opening in the shell mould.   a die member is then formed in the shell mould (31) and  separated from it.
