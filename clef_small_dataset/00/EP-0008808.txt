<ABSTRACT>
the invention is employed for making a reproducible germ count on surfaces by rinsing off a selectable test surface (p) of a part to be investigated, especially with water (w).  the test surface (p) is defined by sealing pressure of the edge (20) of the opening of a container (12) onto the part to be investigated.  in these circumstances, the germ content of the washing water (w) trapped in the lower container part (16) is measured, the water being previously expediently filtered and cooled, in order to prevent an additional clouding by grease and fibre particles.  an opening (18) is employed to fill a predetermined quantity of water, and this is moved in the volume delimited by the container (12) and the test surface (p) for a predetermined length of time periodically by means of a conveyor element (22), which is disposed to dip at least partially in the container (12) at a spacing from the opening (18, 64).  the container may be a component of a removable and sterilisable system head, to the opening (28) of which a covering diaphragm (62) provided with an external opening (64) is exchangeably fitted.  an electronically controlled drive (32) moves the conveyor element (22).  the latter may have at least one wing (24), which is rotatable for example by means of a rotary shaft (30), which passes sealingly through the container (12) or reaches thereto, possibly by a magnetic (slip) coupling (46).    <image>
