<ABSTRACT>
a device is provided for releasably securing a parked  vehicle to an adjacent structure (s).  the device is provided  with a first member (21) hingedly mounted for movement  between an operative mode and an inoperative mode.  when  the first member (21) is in an operative mode the distal end  thereof will releasably engage a portion of the parked vehi­ cle and retain same in a desired position relative to the  adjacent structure (s).  when the first member (21) is in an  inoperative mode, it assumes a vehicle-release position.  the  first member (21) is provided with means (38) for moving  same from the inoperative mode to the operative mode.  a  further means (80, 38) is provided for automatically locking  the first member in an operative mode.  the further means  (10) includes a means for effecting controlled unlocking of  the first member (21) whereby the latter will automatically  return to its inoperative mode.  the first member and asso­ ciated means (28) are mounted so as to move as a unit in a  substantially vertical direction to compensate for dimen­ sional variations occurring in the various vehicles parked  next to the adjacent structure.
