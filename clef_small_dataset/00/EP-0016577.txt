<DESCRIPTION>
semiconductor integrated circuit device" this invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit device with a double interconnection layer consisting of semiconductive material. interconnections hava been formed in prior semiconductor integrated circuit device by means of meta layers diffusion regions formed in the semiconductive substrate, polycrystalline silicon layers and so on. generally, the resistance value of the interconnection means or "wiring layer" is preferred to be smaller, so metal layers for example aluminium layers are preferred. however, when the semiconductor integrated circuit is constructed in high density form, the interconnections cannot be formed by a single metal layer, because it may be necessary for several wiring layers to cross at one point. in such a case one layer may comprise for example a polycrystalline silicon layer as a wiring means: at the crossing point, whilst a second wiring layer made of metal is formed over the first wiring layer with an insulating layer interleaved between the two layers. using this technique, it is easy to produce a semi conductive integrated circuit which includes crossing points of the wiring layers. further, the polycrystalline silicon layer may be used as the electrode of a metal oxide semiconductor field effect? transistor (herein after called mos fet). iten the gate electrode is constructed with polycrystalline silicon material, the mos fet can be manufactured by a self-alignment process so that it will be formed compactly, and its operating characteristics will be improved. thus recently polycrystalline silicon has frequently been used to form the wiring layers and electrodes. however, the sheet resistance of the polycrystalline silicon is very high and so doped poly crystalline silicon has come to be used instead, and has i asheet resistance of the order of several tens of emi1.1 the sheet resistance can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but as the doping level increases it becomes more difficult to control the etching process. thus the quantity of impurity which can be introduced into the polycrystalline silicon as dopant is restricted by the precision of the etching process, so the most commonly used form of doped polycrystalline silicon has a sheet resistance of about emi2.1 which is much higher than that of metal layers for example aluminium layers, so the operating speed and flexibility of design of the circuit will be limited. another method of decreasing the resistance of the polycrystalline silicon layer is to increase its thickness and width. however this can give rise to the disadvantage that the aluminium layer thereover may be pierced by-the sharp edge of the thick polycrystalline silicon layer, and the increase of width will result in an increase the increase of the total area of the device. accordingly the present invention seeks to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit device which can be constructed in high density form and which can operate at high speed. the invention also seeks to provide a semi conductor integrated circuit device including wiring layers whose resistance is kept low. according to one aspect of the present invention there
