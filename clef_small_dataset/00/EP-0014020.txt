<ABSTRACT>
a device for handling documents which operates to  interleave or intermix documents from separate stacks (16,  18) in accordance with a predetermined pattern.  the docuÂ­ ments are fed through the machine preferably so as to be  visible and retrievable throughout their travel.  the machine  includes an inspection station where the documents are  overlapped to permit visual inspection of at least one edge  portion of each separate document.  the documents from  separate stacks are fed one-by-one through separate feed  paths (a, b) with means for insuring single-document feed  and means for counting prior to merger and discharge of  the merged documents.
