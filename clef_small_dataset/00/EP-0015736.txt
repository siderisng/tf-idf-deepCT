<ABSTRACT>
this specification discloses a greatly simplified method  and system for recovering coal from a particulate coal bearing  slurry (1) in which an appropriate hydrophobic liquid or emul­ son of hydrophobic liquid in water (2) is introduced into the in­ let of a centrifugal turbulent flow slurry pump (3) simultaneous­ ly with the introduction of said coal bearing slurry to said pump  inlet, said hydrophobic liquid being introduced in a quantity  sufficient to achieve substantially intimate contact between  said hydrophobic liquid and coal particles in said slurry where­ by the coal may be separated from the slurry by discharging  the slurry from the pump directly over a simple static screen or  other suitable separating device (4) whereupon the separated  coal matter (5) may be collected for subsequent use.  if des­ ired, the coal within said slurry may be additionally agitated in  any suitable manner, such as by means of an in-line flow pro­ moting device (7) which causes additional contact between  the agglomerates produced by the agitation archieved within  the slurry pump (3).
