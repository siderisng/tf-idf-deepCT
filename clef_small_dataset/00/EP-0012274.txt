<ABSTRACT>
the mechanical optical switching device comprises an  input optical fiber with a collimating lens (5) and a first and a  second output optical fiber each with a converging lens (6  and 7, respectively) at the respective terminal ends.  further  there are provided a movable first optical path-changing  means (8) and a fixed second and a fixed third optical path-­ changing means (12 and 13) associated to the first and  second output fiber, the three path-changing means (8, 12  and 13) comprising two reflecting surfaces each.  for per­ forming the switching operation the first optical path-chang­ ing means (8) may be inserted into the optical axis of the colli­ mating input lens (5) or removed therefrom.  in the removed  position the input beam is directed towards the second out­ put fiber via the third path-changing means (13) and the sec­ ond output lens (7), and in the inserted position the input  beam is directed towards the first output fiber via the first  path-changing means (8), second path-changing means (12)  and the first output lens (6).  preferably the first path-chang­ ing means (8) is a parallelogram prism with the two reflecting  surfaces opposite to each other and the second and third  path-changing means (12 and 13, respectively) are triangle  prisms.
