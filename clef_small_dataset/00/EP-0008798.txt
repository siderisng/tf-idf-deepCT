<ABSTRACT>
cutterhead for a portable power planner including a  cylindrical body (11) having a substantially cylindrical surface  and defining a rotational axis about which the cylindrical body  (11) rotates during normal operation of the power planer.  a  solid elongated cutting member (14) is provided and has a  channel (16) formed therein to define at least two cutting  edges (17).  the cylindrical body (11) has an elongated recess  (13) formed therein for holding the cutting member (14).  the  recess (13) extends in a direction parallel to the rotational axis  of the cutterhead and defines a longitudinal aperture (a) in the  surface for accommodating one of the cutting edges (17).  the  recess has a recess wall (24) extending inwardly away from  the aperture (a) to surround and hold the cutting member (14)  against the centrifugal forces acting thereupon during the  rotation of the cylindrical body (11).  positioning pins (18)  arranged in the cylindrical body (11) engage the cutting bar  (14) to angularly fix the cutting member (14) so that the one  cutting edge penetrates the aperture (a) at a predetermined  angle of elevation with respect to the surface of the cylindrical  body (11).  a screw (20) mounted in the cylindrical body (11)  directly engages the cutting member (14) to tightly seat the  latter against the recess wall (24).
