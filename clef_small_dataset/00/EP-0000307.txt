<ABSTRACT>
the process is characterised by approximating the desired form of the thin wall by means of at least one ruled surface, by defining in a known way this ruled surface by means of segments of straight lines which are formed by cable portions stretched between two fixing points, by fixing an envelope formed of a flexible material on these cable portions, and by applying to this envelope a coating which hardens.  this process is especially useful for making air diffusers, baffles and dams.
