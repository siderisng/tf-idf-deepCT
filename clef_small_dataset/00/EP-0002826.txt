<ABSTRACT>
novel phosphoramidothioate derivatives, pesticidal  compositions containing them, processes for preparing  the novel derivatives and the use of the novel derivatives  for combating pests.  novel compounds are provided which exhibit activity  as pesticides for combating fungi, arthropods and/or  nematodes.  the novel compounds have the formula:    wherein   a is phenyl or naphthyl, each optionally substituted  with various defined substituents,   r is hydrogen or (c₁-c₆)alkyl,   r¹ is   a) (c₁-c₆) alkyl optionally substituted with various  defined substituents,   b) (c₃-c₈)cycloalkyl,   c) (c₃-c₆)alkenyl optinally substituted with various  defined substituents,   d) (c₃-c₆)alkenyl,   e) phenylalkyl or naphthylalkyl each having a total  of up to eleven carbon atoms and each being optionally  substituted in the aryl portion with various defined substituents.    r² is   a) (c₁-c₆)alkylthio,   b) phenoxy or naphthoxy each optionally substituted  with nitro, or   c) a group of the formula -nz′z″ wherein z′ is hydrogen  or (c₁-c₆)alkyl, and z″ is hydrogen, (c₁-c₆)alkyl,  (c₃-c₆) alkenyl, di(c₁-c₃) alkylamino, 2-ethylthioethyl,  2-methoxyethyl or alkoxycarbonylalkyl having up to four  carbon atoms in each of the alkoxy and alkyl moieties,   r³ is (c₁-c₆)alkyl, and   x is oxygen or sulfur.
