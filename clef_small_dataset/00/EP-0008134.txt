<ABSTRACT>
self drilling screws and other fastening devices tend  to leave drill chips on outer surfaces of metal cladding  sheets through which they pass and these chips can corrode  and cause deterioration of such sheets.  this problem is  solved in accordance with the present invention by providÂ­ ing a washer (20) through which the fastening device (10)  may pass and which includes a cavity (33) which captures  and retains drill chips as they are formed.  the washer (20)  may be positively locatable on the drill point (15) of the  fastening member (10) and the cavity (33) can be formed  by a skirt region adapted to surround the fastening device  (10).  in one aspect, the cavity (33) may include a mastic  or like material (22) capable of securely holding drill chips.
