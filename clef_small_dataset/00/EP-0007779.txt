<ABSTRACT>
dissolved or dispersed thermoset resins compositions  comprising at least 10% by weight of a polymerizable material  and up to 90% by weight of a solvent or a dispersion medium,  the molecular weight of the resins being by preference at least  500, may be thickened by the addition of a polyfunctional  isocyanate and a trimerisation catalyst.  the thickened com­ positions can be cured by a free radical catalyst and the appli­ cation of heat and/or pressure.  a variety of reinforced articles can be produced from the  thickened compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of thickening dissolved therbicset resin materials, polymerisable compositions obtained theredy and articles produced from said compositions the present invention concerns a method of thickening thermoset resin materials, resulting in thickened compositions and articles produced therefrom. more particularly the thickening is achieved by the addition of a polyfunctional isocyanate, and ttimerization catalyst to a solution of the thermoset resins. thickening thermoset resins by prior art processes frequently suffer. due to lack of control in achieving the desired viscosity or take an unduly long time period to reach the desired viscosity or provide for the formation of products which when cured are deficient in a variety of properties including strength, corrosion resistance, heat stability, and heat distortion temperature among others. in general the prior art processes disclosing thickening techniques rely on the addition of magnesium oxide to unsaturated polyester resins blended with styrene and other polymerizable monomers such as disclosed in u.s. patent 2,628,209. while thickening does occur it is relatively slow even when elevated temperatures are employed. additionally, the thickening process is frequently non interruptible causing inconvenience to the manufacturer since relatively little time is available to process these thickened compositions once the desired viscosity has been achieved. other thickening processes such as disclosed in u.s. patent 3,373,221 depend greatly on urethane linkages by being limited to resins having a large number of reactive hydroxyl groups present or alternatively adding a hydroxyl containing coreactant with the polyisocyanate to provide urethane thickening. other nonorganic thickening agents such as metal oxides other than magnesium oxide greatly depend on the presence of acid groups on the resin to achieve thickening. it has now been discovered that the addition of a poiyisocyanate and a trimerization catalyst allows for the thickening of a large variety of polymerizable materials independent of any isocyanate reactive groups present on those polymerizable materials. according to the process of the invention there is therefore provided a method of increasing the viscosity of a thermoset resin dissolved in up to 90% by weight of a solvent and having a molecular weight of at least 500 which comprises mixing in an effective amount of a polyfunctional isocyanate and catalytic amount of trimerization catalyst selected from the class consisting of quaternary ammonium hydroxides, quaternary ammonium acetates, quaternary ammonium formates, alkali metal acetates and alkali metal formates to produce a thickened uniformly dispersed or solubilized polymerizable composition. according to the invention there is also provided a thickened uniformly dispersed or solubilized polymerizable composition which comprises a resin produced by mixing: a. a blend of (1) up to 90 percent by weight of a solvent and (2) at least 10 percent of a polymerizable thermoset resin having a molecular weight of at least 500. b. a polyfunctional isocyanate. c. a catalytic amount of a trimerization catalyst selected from the class consisting of quaternary ammonium hydroxides, quaternary ammonium acetates, quaternary ammonium formates, alkali metal ecetates and alkali metal formates. the method of the present invention may be utilized to increase the viscosity of any solution of
