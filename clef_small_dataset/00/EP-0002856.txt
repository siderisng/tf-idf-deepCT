<ABSTRACT>
the object was to find a method for the surface treatment of workpieces under a jet of accelerated particles of a treatment means, such as, for example, sand blasting, in which method all surface regions of the workpieces to be treated during the treatment by the particles are uniformly struck on a statistical average at all conceivable angles.  to achieve this object, it was proposed according to the invention to keep a filling of workpieces alone or together with auxiliary bodies in constant vibrational and circulating motion by impulses and to direct the treatment jet against the surface of the filling, which is in a quasi-liquid state.
