<ABSTRACT>
a flow sampling apparatus for sampling a flow of liquid  from a fluid (for example milk and air) has a body through  which a central inlet conduit (4) runs and a dome (2) on the  body.  an inlet orifice (5) on the inlet conduit (4) discharges a  fluid containing some liquid (milk) and the liquid flows  evenly over the inner surface (3) of the dome (2).  one or  more outlet ports is connected to a pair of intermediate  vanes (11) of a flow divider having at least four such vanes  and the liquid passing between the intermediate vanes (11) is  a representative sample of the whole flow over the inner  surface (3) of the dome (2).  the sample is delivered to a  sampling flask (19).
