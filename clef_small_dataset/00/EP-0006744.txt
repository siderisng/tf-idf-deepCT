<ABSTRACT>
coupling means are described which are suitable for  coupling two structural elements (4, 15) together, one of  the elements being in the form of a panel.  the coupling  means described are particularly suitable for use in releas­ ably interconnecting the parts of "quick-assembly" or  "knock-down" furniture and especially systems or unit fur­ niture.  the coupling means has a body member (1) with a  threaded opening (5) which communicates with an internal  cavity (6).  an elongate headed member (10) has a shank  portion (14) which is receivable through a slot (8) formed  in the side of the body member (1) with its head (12) re­ tained within the cavity.  a threaded member (20) is receiv­ able in the threaded opening (5) and is adapted to bear  against the head (12) of the headed member (10).  the  interior of the cavity (6) is so shaped that tightening of the  threaded member (5) in the opening is arranged to draw  the shank (14) of the headed member (10) further through  the slot (8) into the interior of the cavity (6).  in the illustrat­ ed embodiments the cavity wall (7) is frustoconical in  shape.  the body member (1) may be received in use in a  through bore (3) of a panel (4) which through bore (3)  is provided with a side passage (19) opening at the edge  of the panel (4) and adapted to receive the headed member  head (12) first.  with the headed member (10) suitably at­ tached at its shank (14) end to a second panel received  through the passage, the body member (1) may be pushed  into the through bore (3) so that the sides of its slot (8)  embrace the shank (13) of the headed member (10) with  the head (12) thereof received within the cavity (6) of the  body member (1).
