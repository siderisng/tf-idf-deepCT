<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed, in a fire control combat simulator, a  novel computer-generated video display for displaying a  simulated field of view.  electronic generation of the display is  accomplished by a system which includes a host computer, a  plurality of object generators, and related circuitry.  each  object generator contains a memory which stores the image  of an object which may be displayed on the video display.  the  host computer assigns locations in the scene to the objects of  each object generator.  each object generator includes its own  microprocessor which performs calculations based on its  own object information and position and range information  received from the host computer to provide appropriate video  signals for the display.  the related circuitry of the system  includes a blanking and count generator which provides sign­ als whereby the color video information from the object  generator is displayed on the video display and it also estab­ lishes times for permitting updating of the information bet­ ween the host computer and the object generators.  further  features include a priority chain linking the object generators  which, if an overlap situation occurs where more than one  object generator is calling for its information to be displayed  in the same location on the video display, the object which has  been assigned a higher priority, indicating that it is at a closer  range than others, has its overlap information displayed on  the video display instead of those of lower priority.  another  feature is the data compression scheme employed to store the  object image in each object generator.  other features are also  disclosed and claimed.
