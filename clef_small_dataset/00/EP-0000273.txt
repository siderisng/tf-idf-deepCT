<ABSTRACT>
cup selection apparatus in a beverage vending machine  using cups which are pre-charged with dry ingredients and  consisting of a plurality of cup-storage tubes (2), in each of  which, in use, a stack of cups nested one in another is placed,  a selectively-operable cup-dispensing device (8) associated  with each cup-storage tube (2) to separate the bottom cup  from a stack of nested cups in that cup-storage tube, at least  one cup-delivery tube (1) connected to the outlet end of each  of at least two of the cup-storage tubes (2), a cup-guiding  chute (3) leading from the or each cup-delivery tube to a  cup-filing station (5) at which water is to be added to the dry  ingredients in a cup (6), the cup-storage tubes (2), the cup-delivery  tube or tubes (1) and the cup-guiding chute (3) being  positioned so that a cup after release by the cup-despensing  device from a stack of nested cups in a cup-storage tube (2)  will travel by gravity to the cup-filling station (5).
