<ABSTRACT>
1.  drive roller for supporting and driving the cylindrical sleeve of a rotary appliance with a horizontal or slightly inclined axis, said cylindrical sleeve resting on lines of drive rollers, the axis of which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve, comprising a cylindrical spindle (2) which is mounted in a cantilever manner on a frame (1) and is surrounded by a rotary rim (10) and which encloses a motor (5), the rotary rim being driven by a flange (13) which is connected to the motor (5) and being supported on the spindle by means of a bearing, characterised in that the cylindrical spindle (2) fixed to the frame (1) is open on the frame side where the motor (5) is fixed to the spindle (2) by means of a flange (6) and is open on the cantilever side where a reduction unit (7) is fixed to the spindle (2), in that the rim (10) is supported by the spindle (2) by means of a double set of bearings and in that the flange (13) driving the rim (10) is connected to the shaft end of the reduction unit (7).
