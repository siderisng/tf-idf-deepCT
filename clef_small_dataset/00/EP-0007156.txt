<ABSTRACT>
carbamates of the formula    where r and r₁ are various organic imino groups,   x and y independently are nh, n alkyl,  0 or s, and   a can be various aliphatic or aromatic residues, exhibit  insecticidal and nematicidal activities.  they can be made e. g.   by coupling an appropriate bisulfenyl chloride with two moles  of a carbamate or with a mole each of two different carba­ mates, in the presence of an acid acceptor.  the compounds  can be formulated for use in conventional manner with a  diluent and/or surfactant and applied in an effective amount  to the locus to be protected.
