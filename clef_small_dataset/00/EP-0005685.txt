<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a hygienic brush, particularly for  w. c.  vessels, in which the brushing portion of said hygienic  brush comprises a flexible support (2) from which the brush  bristles (2) spread out, such a support having the form of a  hollow cap provided with holes (3) disposed among said  bristles (2) and apt to communicate the interior of said cap  with the exterior, such a cap being in communication with a  reservoir containing a mixture (4) of substances apt to  hygienically treat and to deodore the surfaces of the w. c.   vessel, such a reservoir being in its turn apertured in order to  be penetrated by a water jet which removes partly the  mixture, said mixture being then discharged through the  holes of said hollow cap in order to provide for the treatment  of the vessel surfaces during the brush employ.
