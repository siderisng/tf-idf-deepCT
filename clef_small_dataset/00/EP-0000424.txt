<ABSTRACT>
block copolymers useful as surfactants in oil/water  systems are described.  the copolymers comprise at least  two polymeric components of molecular weight at least  500 which are derived from an oil-soluble complex mono-carboxylic  acid and a polymeric component of molecular  weight at least 500 which is derived from a water-soluble  polyalkylene glycol.  the copolymers may be either oil-soluble  or water-soluble depending on their composition  and may be used as wetting agents, dispersing agents,  emulsifiers or emulsion stabilisers.  the oil-soluble copolymer,  and their blends with low molecular weight conventional  surfactants, are of particular interest for the emulsification  of water in hydrocarbon fuel oils.
