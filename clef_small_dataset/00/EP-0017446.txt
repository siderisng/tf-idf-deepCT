<ABSTRACT>
a temperature sensor comprises a pneumatic fluidic  bistable amplifier (16) whose control ports (26, 28) are  interconnected by a tube (34) to form a fluidic oscillator.  the  tube (34) is exposed externally to a hot gas stream, such as  the turbine inlet gases in a gas turbine engine, so that the  speed of sound in the tube (34) varies with variations in the  temperature of the gases.  this results in a corresponding  variation in the oscillation frequency.  the signal from the  oscillator (16) is then amplified by a fluidic buffer amplifier  (42) and converted to an electrical frequency signal by a  transducer (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
"pluidic temperature sensorn field of the invention this invention relates to temperature sensors, and particularly but not exclusively to sensors for sensing the turbine inlet temperatures in gas turbine engines. it is desirable to have a signal representative of turbine inlet temperature so that the fuel control system can supply the right quantity of fuel to keep the turbine inlet temperature at the maximum permissible, and thereby obtain the best performance from the engine. such sensors may be required to operate at temperatures as high as 11000c. the prior art previously-proposed sensors for this purpose have used thermoelectric devices which either are limited in life by the relatively low operating temperature capability of the materialsbecause of oxidation and corrosion problems in hot gas atmospheres or are extremely costly due to the use of noble elements in their construction. also, these previously-proposed sensors measure temperature at what is virtually a point, rather than over a greater area, so that the measured temperature may not be truly representative of the gas stream. summary of the invention according to the x sent invention, a temperature sensor is characterised a fluidic oscillator whose oscillation depends on the propagation of pressure waves through a space, the space being constructed to maintain the fluid therein at a temperature related to the temperature to be sensed, whereby the propagation time of a pressure wave through the space and hence the frequency of the oscillator is dependent on the temperature to be sensed. more specifically, in the preferred embodiment, the fluidic oscillator comprises a fluidic bistable amplifier having a jet nozzle, a pair of opposed control ports for deflecting the jet produced by the nozzle, and a plurality of outlet ports for receiving the jet, the control ports being interconnected by a passage, switching of the jet from one outlet port to another to produce the oscillation being effected by a pressure wave propagating through the passage from one control port to the other. the passage may be constituted by a tube exposed externally to a fluid, such as the combustion gases supplied to the turbine of a gas turbine engine, whose temperature is to be measured. such a construction provides measurement of the gas temperature over an extended area, and may allow the use of noble metals to be avoided. the temperature sensor may also include buffering means, such as a fluidic buffer amplifier, for receiving the output signals from the oscillator and providing output signals at the same frequency as the oscillator; preferably, the buffering means is situated close to the fluidic oscillator. such an arrangement allows the fluidic frequency signals to be transmitted to a remote location, without the impedance variations which may occur in long connecting conduits affecting the oscillator; this may be important because of the sensitivity of fluidic oscillators to impedance variations. where the fuel control system of the gas turbine engine is electronic in operation, an electrical signal representative of temperature will be required, and this can be provided by a
