<ABSTRACT>
a fluid/particle separator unit (8) comprises a cylindrical  chamber (9) having an inlet end (19) substantially closed by  an apertured rotor (18) and an outlet (5), opposite the inlet,  surrounded by a baffle wall (12) extending coaxially within  the chamber.  the rotor has vanes (25) projecting into the  chamber at an acute angle (Î²) to the circumferential direction  of motion in use and the chamber wall (10) has elongate  bleed slits (17).  in use in a particle-containing fluid flow, the  rotor is rotated so as to oppose the flow through the inlet and  separates particles from the fluid, cleansed fluid leaving the  chamber through the outlet.  in a suction cleaner, the unit is  mounted in the cleaner container so as to separate dust particles  from air drawn through the cleaner, the dust collecting  in the container; the rotor may be driven by a drive shaft (20)  coupled to the shaft of the impeller/motor assembly which  causes the air flow through the cleaner.
