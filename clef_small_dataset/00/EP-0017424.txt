<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the production of oxygenated  organic compounds comprising alcohols, aldehydes, ethers  and salts of carboxylic acids.  prior art processes for the  production of ethanol in particular involve the use of  elevated temperatures and pressures.  milder conditions can  be used in the process of the invention in which either a  mercury compound of formula (r¹ochr²chr³hg)nx (i),  wherein x is an organic or inorganic anion, n is an integer  equal to the valency of the anion, r² and r³ are independent­ ly a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group and r¹ is a hydrogen  atom, an alkyl group or the group ( chr²chr³hg)nx, or  the precursors of the compound (i), with a catalyst compris­ ing a complex containing a metal of group viii, particularly  rhodium, in the presence of a liquid reagent containing an  active acidic hydrogen atom.  a particularly suitable rhodium  complex is one having the formula:   [rh(c₅me₅)₂(oh)₃]cl. xh₂o.
