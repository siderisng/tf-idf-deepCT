<ABSTRACT>
A winding head (1), which is provided in particular for the ejection of bale (43) in connection with a cutting device, consists essentially of a cylindrical wire receiving part, which has at least one receiving slot at its working end at least one receiving slot for gripping the wire and is arranged between two wire guide slots. In order to allow the winding head without the aid of further devices to engage and rewind wire end and, in particular when used for the bale of bale without the aid of a separate lifting device, the wires still at the bale can take effect directly, the wire receiving part is formed as a hollow cylinder (2), of whose working end at least two helical lining, the cylinder wall penetrating slots (6, 7) emanating. The hollow cylindrical wire receiving part is surrounded at a distance from an outer cylinder (3), which has at least two slots (23, 24) extending from its working outgoing screw-line, opposite to the slots of the inner hollow cylinder. The two cylinders are rotatable in both directions relative to each other. The wire spools on the inner cylinder, so that it is withdrawn from the bale and resulting from a small, solid wire wrinkle, which can be easily collected and transported away.
