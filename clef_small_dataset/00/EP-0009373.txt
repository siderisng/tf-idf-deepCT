<ABSTRACT>
a tongue and buckle fastener for a safety belt harness  in which the tongue (1) is received in a passageway (14)  in the buckle (2), a latching member (20) is movable  transversely of the passageway between latching and re足 lease positions, a spring member (30) biases the latching  member into its latched position, and a spring loaded push-足 button (6) is displaceable longitudinally of the passageway  to move the latching member to its release position.  the  push-button has integral blocking means (42) situated  above the latching member, when the push-button is releas足 ed, to prevent accidental release of the tongue.  the push-足 button also has integral ramps (39a, 39b) for raising the  latching member into its release position.  the latching  member is maintained in its release position by a tongue  ejector (17) when the push-button is depressed.
