<ABSTRACT>
fluid flow measuring apparatus comprises two  ultrasonic transducers (1, 2) between which an ultrasonic  energy beam is transmitted through the fluid.  the beam is  frequency modulated (4, 5) lay an audio signal, and the rela­ tionship between the frequency or phase of the received  modulation signal (6,7,8) and that of the transmitted modula­ tion signal gives a measure (10) of the speed of flow of the  fluid.  beams of ultrasonic energy are preferably fed in two  mutually opposite directions, for example by switching (3) the  transducers to act alternately as transmitter and receiver, and  the measurement is computed from the two relationships.  an  anemometer (fig.  7) comprises two such systems arranged to  produce mutually perpendicular ultrasonic beams, and a  computer (25) to compute wind speed (28) and direction (29)  from the frequency or phase relationships.
