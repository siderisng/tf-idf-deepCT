<ABSTRACT>
methods and apparatus for measuring electrical con­ ductivity particularly but not solely for use in detecting  mastitis in individual quarters of a cow's udder employ  the cyclical charge and discharge of a capacitor (c1)  through liquid in a conductivity cell (9), the cycle reversing  on the potential applied to the capacitor (c1) reading a  high reference potential and a low reference potential by  applying the reference potentials to terminals (10, 15) or  sensing leads (32, 33) of electronic devices (vc1, vc2)  or (31) to cause operation of switches (sw1, sw2) or  (s1, s2) so that the variations in frequency are indications  of conductivity of the cell (9).  in one modification a refer­ ence conductance (30) is included in the circuit during  charging of the capacitor (31) and the rate of the time  periods of the cycle gives an indication of the conductance  of the cell (9) in terms of the reference conductance (30).
