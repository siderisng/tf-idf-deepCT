<ABSTRACT>
a homopolar synchronous machine has a slot (22)  formed in the rotor (6) in a direction normal to the intended  path through the rotor (6) of the flux produced by the stator  winding current.  the slot (22) reduces the armature reac足 tance.  a disc machine in accordance with the invention has a  stator from which teeth project axially, a central boss (3) pro足 jecting axially in the same direction as the teeth and a rotor  (6) which is generally rectangular and has a central aperture  (8).  the rotor (6) is mounted for rotation so that the boss (3)  passes through the central aperture (8) and so that there is  an air gap between the rotor (6) and the teeth.  an a.  c.  wind足 ing is wound through the slots between the teeth and a d. c.   winding surrounds the central boss (3).  the slot (22) is  formed so as to extend from the central aperture (8) in the di足 rection parallel to the longitudinal direction of the rotor (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
'ihomopoiar synchronous tschiies" this invention relates to homopolar synchronous machines with primary side excitation. a synchronous machine normally has a wound stator and a rotor on which poles are formed often by windings which is energised with d.c. it is possible to reverse the functions of the stator and the rotor and it is also possible to provide a linear synchronous machine. however,-in this specification the term stator will be applied to that member which carries the winding providing a rotating field and moreover the term stator and rotor will be used even to describe a linear machine which one member is fixed and the other moves linearly. it is known that in almost all synchronous machines that the armature reactance should be minimised in order to obtain a high power output with good power factor and efficiency. a simple expression for power output shows this: emi1.1 where e = induced voltage v = applied voltage i = load angle x = armature reactance. consequently, the smaller x the larger p, other parameters being unchanged. alternators used to generate electricity are of course synchronous generators and in alternators as used in power stations low armature reactance is normally achieved by using a large air gap. this is, of course, an effective method of reducing armature reactance but, in the case of a machine with primary side excitation, it leads to some increase in the required d.c. excitation current to drive the flux across the enlarged air gap which is disadvantageous. the use of a large air gap has an additional disadvantage in the case of a homopolar synchronous machine as opposed to a heteropolar synchronous machine in that fringe flux increases as the air gap increases and leads to a reduction in the induced voltage. this is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which figure 1a shows a relatively small air gap and figure 1b shows a relatively large air gap. in figure 1a, the rotor pole is designated at 11, the stator at 12, the flux lines at 13 and the pole pitch at 14. it can be seen that in the case of a large air gap that fringe flux exists and produces voltages in the windings which are in the wrong sense and which effectively reduce the total voltage in the winding. this problem is of less significance in the case of a heteropolar machine because of the plane of symmetry which exists between two poles of the opposite sense. consequently, the voltages induced because of the fringe flux cancel each other out and have relatively little affect. it is proposed in french patent no. 2 072 611 to provide the rotor of a reluctance machine with flux barriers but as a reluctance machine is not a homopolar machine nor does it have d.c. excitation a solution applicable to a reluctance machine would not normally be applicable to homopolar synchronous machine with primary side excitaticn. it is an oezv of this invention to provide a homopolar synchronous
