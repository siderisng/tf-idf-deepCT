<ABSTRACT>
a pressure relief valve comprises a housing (10) having a  stepped bore comprising a first portion (18) and a second  portion (18) extending through the housing (10).  an annular  shoulder is formed in the housing to define a valve seat (19).  a  piston (22) is slidable in the housing (10) and a spring (30)  biases the piston (22) into engagement with the seat (19).  the  spring (30) is retained by a cap (32).  a seal between the piston  (22) and the seat (19) is made by an o-ring (25) located in an  annular groove (23).  passageways (37) adjacent the seat (19)  communicate the exterior and interior of the housing (10).  the  total cross-sectional area of the passageways (37) is less than  the area of the second bore portion (20) causing, in operation,  a pressure build-up in the first portion (18) below the piston  (22) which increases piston movement.  the pressure relief valve is particularly suitable for use on  life rafts.
