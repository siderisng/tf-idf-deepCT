<ABSTRACT>
a continuous process for the removal of so₂ from a  stream of waste gases comprising contacting the waste gas  stream with a stream containing water and bromine.  preferably the resulting hydrobromic acid is electrolysed  to produce hydrogen and bromine; which bromine is then  recycled to the contacting stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
"continuous process for the removal of so from waste gases, and hydrogen and sulphuric acid produced thereby " the invention is concerned with a process for the removal of so, from waste gases. it is known that most fossil fuels, such as heavy fuel oil and coal, contain considerable quantities of sulphur. this gives rise to the emission of significant quantities of sulphur dioxide in the combustion product gases. sulphur dioxide, however, is a very harmful agent: 3 daily averages above 300 microgram/m3 (0.11 n m) are already considered hazardous to human health. consequently, current standards of protection of the environment call for the removal of the majority of the sulphur dioxide from the combustion waste gases, before those gases are vented into the atmosphere. the known processes to remove s02 from waste gases can be classified into two general categories; those processes in which the sulphur is disposed of as waste (throw-away produ-t systems) and processes in which the sulphur product, in the form of, e.g. elemental sulphur or sulphuric acid, is marketed (saleable product processes). the following commercially-offered throw-away and saleable product systems are considered the most important for near future (about 1985): throw-away : lime scrubbing, limestone scrubbing and double alkali process; saleable product : magnesium oxide scrubbing and sodium sulphate scrubbing (wellmann-lord process). the drawbacks of the existing processes are mainly of a practical and economical nature: the throw-away processes produce a very impressive amount of valueless material which must be disposed of. to give an example, a 600 mwe power station using coal containing 2.5% of s produces annually approximately 300 000 tons of sludge. disposal of these huge amounts cleats a considerable practical and financial problem for the power-producing utilities. on the other hand, the saleable product processes are expensive, especially with regard to investment costs. moreover, they generally produce sulphuric acid in a rather dilute form. this fact either requires additional (expensive) concentration procedures or gives rise to difficulties in marketing the product. the present invention seeks to overcome these drawbacks. processes are also known for removing impurities, such as sulphur dioxide, from gas streams using chlorine in the presence of water (see, for example, united kingdom patent specification nos.603735, 901630, 1399214, 1474626 and 1496143); but it has not been suggested that there are any advantages in using bromine rather than chlorine as the oxidising agent. in united kingdom patent specification no. 1399214, bromine is mentioned as one of many possible oxidising agents which may be used in the particular apparatus disclosed and claimed in that specification, but again no particular advantage has been suggested for its use in removing sulphur dioxide. furthermore, the specification teaches the use of a semi-permeable membrane to separate the gas to b# purified from the oxidising solution so that no direct contact can take place between the two phases. in accordance with the present invention there is provided a continuous process for the removal of s02 from a stream of waste gases comprising contacting the waste gas

 claims:    1. a continuous process for the removal of   so,    from a stream of waste gases comprising contacting the waste gas stream with a stream containing water and bromine.     2. a process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the resulting sulphuric acid and hydrobromic acid are separated.    3. a process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the resulting hydrobromic acid is electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and bromine.    4. a process as claimed in claim 3 wherein the resulting bromine is recycled to the contacting stream.    5. a process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the contacting stream contains:  sulphuric acid: between 0 and 50 wt %,  hydrogen bromide: between 5 and 40 wt %,  bromine: between 0 and 10 wt %.      6. hydrogen when produced in accordance with a process as claimed in claim 3.    7. sulphuric acid when produced in accordance with a process as claimed in claim 2.
