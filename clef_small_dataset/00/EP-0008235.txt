<ABSTRACT>
disclosed are improved melt processable, self-tem­ perature regulating, irradiation cross-linkable, electrically  semi-conductive polymeric compositions (5) which in con­ junction with annealing at a temperature at or above their  melt point temperatures subsequent to their having been  radiation cross-linked provide for improved self-tem­ perature regulating electrical heating devices (1) includ­ ing flexible electrical heating cables.  heating cables (1)  made in accordance with the invention comprise two or  more elongate substantially parallel spaced-apart elec­ trical conductors that are electrically interconnected by  means of extruded forms of the compositions which have  been annealed at a temperature at or above their melt point  temperatures prior and subsequent to their having been  cross-linked by irradiation.  the compositions of the in­ vention have an amount of electrically conductive particles,  such as carbon black, dispersed therein, that is controlled  within the range of 17% to 25% by weight to the total weight  of the compositions.
