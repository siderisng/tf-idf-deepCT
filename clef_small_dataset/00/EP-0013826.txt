<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a process for purifying insulin us­ ing a cross-linked dextran gel cation exchanger containing sul­ foalkyl or carboxymethyl groups.  the process comprises:   a) swelling and equilibrating a cross-linked dextran gel cation  exchanger containing sulfoalkyl or carboxymethyl groups;   b) packing a column with the swollen gel;   c) dissolving a partially purified insulin at a concentration in  the range of from about 0. 05% to about 12%, weight per vol­ ume, in an acidic aqueous medium having a ph of from  about 2. 5 to about 4. 5 and containing urea in a concentra­ tion of from about 4 to about 8 moles per liter of medium;   d) bringing the insulin solution into contact with the column-­ packed cation exchanger gel; and   e) eluting insulin from the cation exchanger gel at a tempera­ ture of from about 5°c.  to about 25°c.  by passing an eluant  over the insulin-containing cation exchanger gel, said  eluant comprising acidic aqueous medium containing inor­ ganic salt, and said inorganic salt being present in said acid­ ic aqueous medium in a progressively increasing concen­ tration commencing at or below about 0. 2 moles per liter  and extending to as high as about 0. 4 moles per liter.
