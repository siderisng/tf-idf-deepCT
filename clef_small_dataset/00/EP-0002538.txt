<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for manufacturing bundles (1) of bags (2) from heat-sealable material, these bags being of "bottom seal" (3) type and having a weakened area (5) in parallel relationship with the bag bottom (4) and located adjacent that bag edge (6) opposite the bag bottom (4) to allow tearing the bags (2) one by one away from the bundle (1) and obtaining along the tearing line (7), the opening of said bags, said method which lies in manufacturing the bags (2) one by one, in superimposing them to form a pile comprising a determined number of bags, in the shape of a straight parallelepiped, in assembling the bags from the pile to form a bundle (1) and in discharging this letter one when the predetermined number of bags has been reached, being characterized in that during the forming of the bundle, one applies the bag edges (6) opposite to the bottoms (4) on the cutting means (12) for the bags and one brings these cutting means to such a temperature that they can insure fusing of the heatsealable material over the whole pile height.
