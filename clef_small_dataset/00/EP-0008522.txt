<ABSTRACT>
a strain gage comprising a flexure beam (11) has depoÂ­ sited thereon a dielectric layer (16) on which is formed a  pattern of thin film resistors (17) which alter their value in  response to flexing of the beam.  the resistors are covered by  a passivation dielectric layer (18).  in accordance with the  invention, the dielectric layer(s) (16, 18) are deposited in such  a manner that they are normally in a state of compressive  stress so as to reduce the likelihood of cracking and failure.   the layer(s) (16, 18) are preferably deposited by sputtering.
