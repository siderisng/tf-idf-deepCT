<ABSTRACT>
a connector for coupling together conductors (22, 26) of  two or more electrical components (24, 28), including a pair  of jaw portions (36, 37), a pair of lever portions (30, 31)  respectively connected to and extending away from said jaw  portions to form a fulcrum (33) such that squeezing together  of the lever portions brings about an opening of the jaw  portions, and biasing means (44, 48, 50) arranged to urge  together said jaw portions.  for increased clamping pressure, the biasing means  includes resiliently deformable connecting means (48, 50)  connecting together the free ends of the lever portions, and a  resiliently deformable link member (44) connecting the  junction of said connecting means to a point on the  connector near the fulcrum.  upon the squeezing together of  the lever portions the connecting means and link member  are deformed but tend to resume their original shape upon  release of the lever portion to provide constant clamping  pressure on the conductors placed between the jaw portions.
