<ABSTRACT>
In a newspaper self-seller, the newspapers are laid horizontally onto a support table (13).The pad table undergoes a force with a chain bottle train (14) with a tension spring (18) on the bottle (142), which pushes it upwards.A sampling (19) at a rotary arm (192) with a pin (194) engages by boosting the supporting (13) in the sprocket (141) of the chain bottle tag, and the table is blocked at this altitude.By pressing a handle, the uppermost newspaper is turned out by a gripper pawl in the circle around the exposure point of the Abta Ster as a pivot point out of the output sleat and can be made and pulled out completely.This ensures that not the whole pressure of the adjusting spring (18) presses onto the dispenser, but the pressure is concentrated consistently at a point, wherein the pressure is comparatively low.
