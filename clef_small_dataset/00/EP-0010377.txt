<ABSTRACT>
a hydraulic booster (14), suitable for a vehicle braking  system having a fluid pressure power source (12,15), includes  a boost piston (17), control means (32,33,34) for governing a  differential pressure across the boost piston (17) in accorÂ­ dance with the braking effort required and feedback means  (35) arranged to transmit a proportion of the brake applying  force developed by the booster (14) to a driver's brake pedal,  the boost piston (17) having an area arranged to be exposed to  the fluid pressure from the power source (12,15) so that the  piston (17) is constantly urged towards a return position by  the effect of the fluid pressure on said area.  preferably the feedback means (35) comprises a resilient  annular disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
"fluid pressure brake booster this invention relates to vehicle fluid pressure brake boosters of the type interposed between a drivers brake pedal and brake applying means so as to reduce the brake pedal load required for a given vehicle braking effect. such fluid boosters include feedback means for developing a brake pedal load substantially proportional to the brake applying force generated by the booster, this provides the vehicle driver with - an indication of the braking force devloped at the vehicle wheels. in one known booster the feedback means comprise a resilient member interposed between the necessary boost piston and booster output push rod for transferring a fixed proportion of the brake applying force developed by the booster to the brake pedal. other boosters have feedback means which develop a brake pedal load in accordance with the fluid operating pressure within the booster. one problem with fluid pressure boosters is that stiction is caused between the booster piston and the co-operating booster bore sy the necessary fluid seals which are under pressure from the fluid power source. this may result in a high brake pedal load to initiate booster piston movement, and may also act against the effect of the usual boost piston return spring to delay or prevent complete return of the boost piston to the inactive position. it is an object of the present invention to provide a booster which overcomes the aforementioned problem. according to the invention there is provided a hydraulic booster, for a vehicle braking system having a fluid pressure power source, the booster having a boost piston, control means for governing a differential pressure across the boost piston in accordance with the braking effort required and means arranged so as, in use, to feedback to a brake pedal a load proportional to the brake applying force generated by the booster, characterised thereby that the boost piston has an area arranged to be exposed to fluid pressure from the power source so that, in use, the piston is constantly urged towards a return position by the effect of the fluid pressure on said area. preferably the boost piston area arranged to be exposed to fluid pressure is an annulus formed at a radial step in the outside diameter of the boost piston. other features of the invention are included in the following description of a preferred embodiment shown, by way of example, on the accompanying drawing which is a schematic representation of a suitable hydraulic brake circuit and incorporates a transverse section through a brake booster valve according to the preferred embodiment. the apparatus to be described is intended for fitting in a conventional motor vehicle hydraulic brake circuit between a driver's brake pedal and a brake master cylinder. referring to the drawings, on which arrows indicate the direction of hydraulic fluid flow there is shcvn a reservoir 11 from which a pump 12 delivers hydraulic fluid under pressure to the inlet port 13 of a brake booster valve 14. an hydraulic accumulator 15 is
