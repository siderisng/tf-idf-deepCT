<ABSTRACT>
this invention is directed to polyurethanes and to a pro­ cess for preparing polyurethanes having a flexural modulus  ratio (-29°c/70°c) not greater than 3. 4 and having at least  three thermal transition temperatures between -100°c and  the decomposition temperature of the polyurethane as  determined by thermomechanical analysis.  the polyurethane  is prepared by admixing and reacting three active hydrogen  compounds with a polyisocyanate or polyisothiocyanate  wherein one of the active hydrogen compounds has a reactiv­ ity with a polyisocyanate greater than the reactivity of either of  the other two active hydrogen compounds.  the  polyurethanes of this invention are suitable for metal  replacement applications wherein the polyurethane is formed  by reaction injection molding.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
reaction injection molded polyuretbanes the present invention concerns polyurethanes suitable for reaction injection molding (rim). such polyurethanes are being sought for use in various metal replacement applications so as to reduce weight. as the physical properties are improved, the applications available for replacement of automobile parts currently made of metal can be increased. such polyurethane rim applications are thoroughly discussed in a paper by r. m. gerkin and f. e. critchfield, titled "the proper ties of high modulus rim urethanes", presented at the september 26-30, 1977 meeting of the society of automotive engineers and in a paper by w. w. ludwico and r. p. taylor titled "the bayflex 110 series-the new generation of rim materials" presented at the same meeting. it is desirable that polyurethanes employed in metal replacement applications have modulus values which do not differ widely at high and low temperatures. the gerkin and critchfield article revealed a ratio of the flexural modulus value measured at -230c divided by the value measured at 700c for unfilled formulations of between 5 and 7. the ludwico and taylor paper disclosed ratios of flexural modulus values on unfilled systems measured at -300c and 650c of 3.56. polyurethanes of the present invention have ratios of the flexural modulus values measured on unfilled systems at -200f (-290c) and 1580f (700c) of less than 3, even less than 2. such polyurethanes also have at least 3 thermal transition temperatures as measured by thermomechanical analysis between -1000c and the decomposition temperature of the polyurethane. u.s. patents 3,983,068 and 4,028,303 teach polyurethanes prepared by reacting three polyols with a polyisocyanate. one of the polyols must be an amine -initiated polyol having a hydroxyl equivalent weight from 50 to less than 250. a second polyol has a hydroxyl equivalent weight of at.least 700 if it is a diol and at least 500 if it has a functionality from 3 to 8. a third polyol is a non-amine initiated polyol having a hydroxyl equivalent weight of less than 200. these patents contain no examples of polyurethanes prepared from three polyols. the present invention is directed to a polyurethane prepared by admixing and reacting three active hydrogen compounds with an organic polyisocyanate or polyisothiocyanate charcterized in that one of the active hydrogen compounds has a reactivity with a polyisocyanate greater than the reactivity of either of the other two active hydrogen compounds, the solubility parameter of each active hydrogen compound being different from each other by a value greater than 0.49 when the number of active hydrogen equivalents of the second most reactive active hydrogen compound is greater than the number of active hydrogen equivalents of the most reactive active hydrogen compound, the polyurethane composition having a flexural modulus factor (-290c/700c) not greater than 3.4 and having at least three thermal transition temperatures between -1000c and the decomposition temperature of the polyurethane as determined by thermomechanical analysis. the invention is also directed to a process for the preparation of a polyurethane by admixing and reacting three active hydrogen compounds
