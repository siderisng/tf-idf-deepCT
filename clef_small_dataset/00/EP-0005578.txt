<ABSTRACT>
a wagon capable of traveling on a railway and on the  ground, consisting of a chassis on which, near the front and  rear ends, wheels are mounted for traveling on a railway,  and parallel thereto, wheels for traveling on the ground.  the  wheels for traveling on the ground being offset from the  pivot of the truck in a direction perpendicular to the axles and  the wheels for traveling on a railway being mounted in a  linkage attached to the truck near one end thereof, the other  end connecting with a locking means brought into engagement  by the swing of the linkage with at least one receiving  member attached to the chassis, so that a truck may be fixed  in one or more positions.  because the wheels are mounted in  trucks, the wagon can readily negotiate sharp curves in the  railway, and because the ground wheels are offset from the  pivot of the truck, a sort of swivel is formed, so that in  traveling on the ground, the swivels will always caster to the  rear in relation to the direction of travel.
