<ABSTRACT>
1,1′-biphenyl-2-yl alkylamine derivatives of formula (i):    wherein:   x is hydrogen or a halo substituent at any position in  the phenyl ring;   r¹ is hydrogen, hydroxy, c≡n, conr⁵r⁶, or co₂r⁸  where r⁵, r⁶, r⁸ independently represent hydrogen or alkyl;   r² is hydrogen or alkyl;   z is -(ch₂)n- or   -ch₂ch₂-;   where n is an integer of from 2 to 4;   r³ and r⁴ independently are hydrogen, c₁₋₆ alkyl,  ch₂c₂₋₅ alkenyl, phenyl c₁₋₃ alkyl, or taken together with the  adjacent nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group or a  pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.  the compounds are prepared by the usual methods for  analogous compounds.  they have been found to be effec­ tive in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.  pharmaceutical  formulations have been prepared.

<DESCRIPTION>
1,1'-biphenyl-2-yl alkylamine derivatives, their production and cardiovascular preparations containing same. this invention relates to a novel class of 1,1'-biphenyl-2-yl alkylamine derivatives which are useful in the chemotherapy of cardiovascular disorders. cardiovascular disorders are responsible for thousands of deaths each year. cardiac arrhythmias are one of.these disorders contributing to such deaths. whilst the true causes of arrhythmias are unknown, it is believed that they are caused by some abnormality in the rate, regularity or site of origin of cardiac impulses, or by disturbances which affect the sequence of activation of the atria and ventricles. several drugs currently are used in the treatment of arrhythmias, the most notable including quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine and digitalis. a great deal of interest recently has been generated over a new antiarrhythmic agent, aprindine, a 2-aminoindane derivative; see u.s. patent nc. 3,923,813. several diphenylalkylamines also have recently been reported to have useful antiarrhythmic activity; see u.s. patent nos. 4,001,328, 4,034,011 and 3,987,201. unfortunately, most if not all of these existing drugs possess undesirable side effects and thus there exists a continuing need for new drugs capable of being used in the treatment of arrythmias and possessing reduced incidence of undesired side effects. accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of formula (i): emi2.1 wherein: x is hydrogen or a halo substituent at any position in the phenyl ring; r1 is hydrogen, hydroxy, c#n, conr5r6, where r5 and r6 independently represent hydrogen or c1-6 s 8 alkyl, or co2r8 where r8 is hydrogen or c14 alkyl; r2 is hydrogen or c1-3 alkyl; z is -(ch2)n- or emi2.2 where n is an integer of from 2 to 4; r3 and r4 independently are hydrogen, c1-6 alkyl, ch2c2-5 alkenyl, phenyl c13 alkyl, or taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group containing from 5 to 7 ring atoms and optionally containing one heteroatom selected from oxygen and nitrogen; and the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. preferred compounds of formula (i) are those wherein x is hydrogen, or fluoro, chloro or bromo situated at the 5-position of the biphenyl ring; rú is hydrogen, hydroxy, c#n, conh2 or cooh; rê is hydrogen or methyl, z is (ch2)n where n is 2 or 3 or is -ch2ch(oh)ch2- when rú is hydrogen; and r3 and r independently are hydrogen, c1-6 alkyl, ch2c2-5 alkenyl, phenyl c1-3 alkyl, or taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group selected from pyrrolidino, piperidino and morpholino; and the pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition or quaternary ammonium salts thereof. other preferred compounds of formula (i) have one or more of the following features: 1.. x is hydrogen or fluoro; 2. r1 is hydroxy; 3. r1 is c=n; 4. r1 is conh2; 5. r2 is hydrogen; 6. r3 is other than hydrogen; 7. r3 is c14 alkyl, especially isopropyl; 8. r4 is hydrogen or c14 alkyl; 9. z is -ch2ch2ch2-; 10. z is emi3.1 11. are pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts; or 12. are pharmaceutically-acceptable quaternary ammonium salts. this invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations which comprise a compound of formula (i),
