<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus are disclosed for controlling the  proportions in which dry particulate matter and liquid are  added to a rotary pelletizer (107), so as to control the size of the  pellets being produced.  the depth of material on the tray of  the pelletizer is measured at a particular position and the  resulting signal is suitably smoothed and otherwise con­ ditioned before being combined with a signal indicating either  present liquid supply rate or present dry matter supply rate.   the combined signal then being compared with a set point  signal to generate an error or control signal which can be  employed to control either the liquid flow rate or the dry  matter flow rate.  since pellet size is related to the relative  proportions of the liquid and dry matter flow rates to the  pelletizer these forms of control enable control of the size of  pellets produced, since the error or control signal can be  arranged to influence this ratio in the direction appropriate to  counter the effects which fluctuations of the measured vari­ ables would otherwise have upon pellet size.
