<ABSTRACT>
In a built-up piston for internal combustion engines, the lower part (1) is connected to the upper part (6) from an iron material by a screw ring (8).In order to reduce the energy contained in the combustion gases, the screwed with the lower part scrolling (8) with a convolution located on its inside bundle (11) in a rotation (12) on the top of the piston to form a gap (13)Its axially extend the surface and is braced with its piston-side surface (15) against the opposite surface of the Einkre hung (12).
