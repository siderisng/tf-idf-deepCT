<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a process for the preparation of  the compounds of the formula (i):    and salts and esters thereof wherein r¹ is a hydrogen atom, a  lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a phenyl group or a  phenyl-(lower alkyl) group; and r² is a hydrogen atom, a  lower alkyl group, or a ch₂or³ group where r³ is a hydrogen  atom, a lower alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl-(lower  alkyl) group or a lower acyl group, or r¹ is joined to r² to  form the residue of a 5-7 membered saturated carbocyclic  ring; which process comprises the reaction of an ester of  clvaulanic acid with a compound of the formula (ii):    wherein r¹ and r² are as defined in relation to formula (i),  and thereafter, if desired, de-esterifying the thus-produced  ester to form the free acid or a salt.
