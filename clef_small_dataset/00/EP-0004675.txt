<ABSTRACT>
a dike (11) for retaining the refuse floating at the water surface is comprised of one or a plurality of containers (12) interconnected in a flexible manner: these containers (12) are formed by conduits closed at the ends thereof by means of covers (15, 16), their cross-section area being preferably circular; they are made of a wear-resistant material.  the containers (12) are interconnected by bonds (17), for example a cable, passing through the inside of the conduits.  each container (12) is composed of two conduits (13, 14) arranged one inside the other end firmly secured one to the other at their respective ends by means of the covers (15, 16); the bond (mooring chain 17) is introduced inside the conduit (14).  the containers can be provided with a center board (18) and/or a protuberance (23).  the covers may have a curved shape and a widening (25) for the introduction of the bond (17).
