<ABSTRACT>
a multiple hydrocyclone device (14) wherein cyclone  units (28) are integrally formed in radial relationship in  units (28) are integrally formed in radial relationship in pre­ molded separable discs (27) which are mounted in stacked  concentric and internested relationship one upon the other  within a common housing (15).  the hub portions (37) of  discs (27) provide a central chamber (30) to receive the  underflow fraction from the cyclones with the overflow dis­ charged from openings in the periphery (38) of discs (27)  to an outer chamber (34).  sealing rings (54) are arranged  between the internested discs to maintain leak proof inte­ grity of the stacked discs (27) with spring (80) urgent  thrust plate means (73) disposed at the to of the stack to  permit movement or expansion of the discs in operation of  the device without disturbing the sealed relationship.
