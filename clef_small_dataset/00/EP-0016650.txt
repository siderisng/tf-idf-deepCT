<ABSTRACT>
2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone is a novel compound which has been found to be suitable for use as a perfuming or odor-modifying ingredient of fragrance or flavoring compositions, the compositions themselves being useful in the perfuming or flavoring of, for example, dentifrices etc.  2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone has a fresh, cool perfume or flavor and can enhance the perfume or flavor of other perfuming or odor-modifying ingredients.  it can readily be produced from cyclopentanone.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone, fragrance or flavoring compositions containing it, and use of said compositions in the perfuming or flavoring of, for example, dentifrices this invention relates to 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone, fragrance or flavoring compositions containing 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone as perfuming or odormodifying ingredients, and the use of such compositions. in recent years, ingredients that give various perfuming or flavoring notes1 particularly fresh, clean, cool and green notes, have been incorporated in fragrance or flavoring compositions for use in dentifrices, mouth fresheners, chewing gums, foodstuffs, beverages, shampoos, toilet soaps, cosmetics, household materials, detergents, etc. it is common practice to prepare such fragrance or flavoring compositions by suitably combining various known perfuming or odor-modifying ingredients or incorporating them in varying proportions. however, combinations of known perfuming or odor-modifying ingredients are not entirely satisfactory, and the development of novel perfuming or odor-modifying ingredients affording fresh, clean and cool notes has been highly desired. the invention provides fragrance or flavoring compositions having enhanced and/or different odors or flavors than the conventional ones, by using a novel perfuming or odor-modifying ingredient that can impart fresh and clean and/or cool notes to fragrance or flavoring compositions the present invention is based upon the finding that a novel substance, 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone, exhibits an excellent perfuming or odor-modifying effect. thus, the present invention provides a fragrance or flavoring composition containing as one of its active ingredients a novel substance, 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone, expressed by the following formula: emi2.1 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone call readily be synthesized by known.synthesizing methods, for example, the methods described in roland mayer, chem. ber. 89, 1443 (1956). martin cordon, et al., j. am. chem. soc., 76, 1643 (1954); and georges le guillanton, bull. soc. chim. france, 1963(3), 611. a preferred method in terms of yield, operabilityg and availability of starting material involves condensing cyclopentanone in the presence of a basic condensation agent and hydrogenating the resulting 2-cyclopentylidene-cyclopentanone 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone possesses light green notes svhich are fresh and cool and minty notes which are strong, sharp and cool. therefore, 2-cyclopentylcyclopentanone imparts fresh, clean and/or cool notes to various fragrance or flavoring compositins when incorporated in them. the fragrance or flavoring compositions can be used in order to modify or improve the olfactory properties of materials such as dentifrices, mouth fresheners, chewing gums, foodstuffs, beverages, shampoos, soaps, cosmetics, household materials, detergents, cleaning products, paints, papers, etc. the amount of 2cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone added to a fragrance or flavoring composition can vary according to the type of the the fragrance or flavoring composition, the specific organoleptic effects required, and so forth. usually, that amount is 0.001 to 40% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 15% by weight, based on the fragrance or flavoring composition. 2-cyclopentyl-cyclopentanone is stable and can be easily mixed with other perfuming or odor-modifying ingredients. it is also economical because it is produced from an ordinary starting material with ease and at low cost. the present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the following examples. referential example k 5-liter three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a reflux condenser was charged with 840 g
