<ABSTRACT>
an electrical horn has a hollow body (19) fitted with a  diaphragm (71) secured to an armature (74).  a self-supporting  coil (24) is disposed with clearance in a recess (23) in the body  (19).  the coil (24) has no central former but is provided with  upper and lower electrically insulating flanges (25) and (26).   the flange (25) has laterally projecting support portions (27  and (28) engaging the body (19).  the support portion (28) has  an integral upstanding port (59) fitted with an electrically  conducting sleeve (60).  mounted in stacked relationship on  the support portion (28) and around the port (59) and sleeve  (60) are an eyelet (56) and an electrical connector (54).  the  post (59) and sleeve (60) are deformed to produce a head  which holds the eyelet (56) and electrical connector (54) in  engagement, without the need to use a rivet extending  through the support portion (28) and the body (19).  this  reduces the risk of entry of water into the body in service.  the  lack of a central former for the coil improves air circulation  therearound.
