<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic holding device, in particular a measuring stand, has at least two webs (2, 4; 3, 5) consisting of ferromagnetic material and arranged at a distance from one another, between which a permanent magnet (1) is movably held.  in order to achieve as simple a design as possible and to permit single-hand operation, the webs (2, 4; 3, 5) are connected to one another at one end by a crossweb (12) of ferromagnetic material and are separated in the central region by a separating layer (6; 7) of non-magnetisable material.  the permanent magnet (1) faces the one web (2, 4) with a magnetic pole (5) and the other web (3, 5) with the other magnetic pole (n) and can be moved backwards and forwards in the axial direction of the webs (2, 4; 3, 5) so that it is located in the release position between the two upper sections (2, 3) of the webs which are located between the crossweb (12) and the separation layers (6; 7) of non-magnetisable material, while the permanent magnet (1) is located in the working position, in which a ferromagnetic workpiece is attracted, between the lower sections (4, 5) of the webs.  <image>
