<ABSTRACT>
1.  continuous copying apparatus, in the case of which an image of the original which is conveyed by pairs of transport rollers across a stripshaped exposure window is formed on a recording support which, during the exposure operation, moves at a speed corresponding to the speed of transport of the original, having a pair of intake rollers for the original arranged before the exposure window and a pair of removal rollers for the original arranged after the exposure window, each pair of transport rollers being formed by a roller secured to the apparatus and a roller which is mounted so that it can move and which, in the working position, lies, under the action of a spring or weight, adjacent the rolle secured to the apparatus, characterised in that each of the shafts (14, 15) of the movable rollers (16, 17) of each pair of rollers (4, 16, 5, 17) forms, together with link member (11), which is approximately parallel to the plane (35) of transport of the original, the coupling link of a four-link mechanism, the cranks (10, 12) of the four-link mechanism are inclined at an acute angle towards the intake direction (c) of the original (6), and a pressure force (p1 ) for the intake roller (16) running substantially parallel to the crank (10) associated with this roller acts on the intake roller (16).
