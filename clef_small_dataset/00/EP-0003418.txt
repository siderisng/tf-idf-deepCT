<ABSTRACT>
a loader for tire machinery as tire presses is disclosed,  which loader is supported from a vertically and horizontally  movable frame and which includes a vertical shaft or sleeve  journaled with respect to the frame with a horizontal plate  (27) secured for rotation therewith.  loader shoes (50) are  mounted on the frame radial movement and respective link  means (82) interconnect the plate and each loader shoe, each  link extending at a common angle with respect to a radius  from the center of rotation of the plate, and rotation of the  plate (27) in one direction will reduce the angle accordingly  moving the shoes radially outwardly and rotation of the plate  in the opposite direction will increase the angle moving the  shoes radially inwardly.  each link (82) is adjustable in length  and the extent of rotation of the plate in one or both  directions is limited by adjustable stops.  the loader shoes  remain parallel throughout their movement and are supported  for radial movement by self-aligning slider blocks (75,  76, 77, 78).
