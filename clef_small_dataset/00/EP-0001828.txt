<ABSTRACT>
1.  a fire door which consists of two panels (3, 4), which are interconnected at least at one rebated surface by a connecting channel (5), wherein the interior of the resulting box section is provided with insulating material (6) and/or with a stiffening structure and, if desired, a rebate strip protruding from the rebated surface is formed in one panel, each of the two panels (3, 4) is bent through 90 degrees so as to form an edge strip (7, 8) of the rebated surface and the edge strips (7, 8) are interconnected by the connecting channel (5), characterized in that the joint between each flange (13, 14) of the connecting channel (5) and the edge strips (7, 8) is a snap joint, the end portions of the flanges (13, 14) of the connecting channel (5) are infolded through about 180 degrees to form a retaining lip (15, 16) the end portion of each edge strip (7, 8) is first angled through 90 degrees toward the interior of the door and then reversely folded through 180 degrees toward the outside of the door so as to form a slot which is open to the periphery of the door, and the slot (9, 10) is provided at its free end with a retaining lip (11, 12), which is reversely folded inwardly through 180 degrees and in the snap joint faces the retaining lip (15, 16) of the connecting channel (5).
