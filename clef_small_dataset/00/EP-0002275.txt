<ABSTRACT>
granular activated carbon is manufactured from briquettes  formed from brown coal, from which iron material has  been extracted, by crushing and screening the pretreated  coal briquettes to produce ganules, treating the granules  with a dilute aqueous solution of inorganic acid (h₂so₄,  h₃po₄ or hcl) at a concentration of about 1 to about 10% by  weight ro reduce the volatile content and thereby increase  the fixed carbon content comprising: mixing the granules  with the acid, washing off the acid, and drying the granules.   in one case the washed granules are dried partially without  the addition of a binder.  in the other case the granules are  dried and mixed with about 5 to about 15% by weight of coal  tar pitch.  the so treated granules are ground to form fine  powder which is compressed into shapes such as pellets,  and then granulated.  these reformed granules are devolatilized,  without charring, by directly heating to and at a  temperature higher than the charring temperature in an  oxygen-free atmosphere, and then activated by heating to  and at a temperature higher than the devolatilizing temperature  in an atmosphere containing a gaseous activating agent.   the activated granules have a surface area of not less than  about 900 m²/gram, an abrasion number of not less than  about 70, and an apparent density of not less than about 0. 46  gram/cc, which properties make them suitable for use in  water and waste water treatment and in other applications.
