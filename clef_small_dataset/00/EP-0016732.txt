<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of photographic abbreviations, which is characterized, since (a) a photographic material is imped imagewise, which optionally, at least during the silver halide development stage in this order, a cover layer (7), at least one silver halide emulsion layer (5), a layer which substantive azamethine compound (2) Enter, and a carrier (1) contains, where appropriate one or more intermediate layers are located between these components, (b) treated the exposed photo graphic material with a waterproof processing bath to a solution or dispersion of a bleaching to make the winder connection in the or the silver halide sion layer (s) and thereby develop the latent silver image in the or the silver halide pulse (s) and (c) at the points without latent image the bleaching developer connection in opposite directions to the image from the resp . The silver Halog emulsion layer (s) into the layer containing a substantive azamethine compound can be diffused to bleach the compound to form a dye image there.
