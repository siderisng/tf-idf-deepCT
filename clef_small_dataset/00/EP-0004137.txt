<ABSTRACT>
an antigenically-active cell envelope fraction from bacterial  cells, especially bordetella pertussis, may be isolated  by disrupting the cells, separating the cell envelopes from  the other cell components, extracting the separated  envelopes with a solution of a zwitterionic surfactant and  precipitating the cell envelope preparation from the resulting  extract by the addition of a lower alkyl (c₁ to c₅) alcohol,  preferably ethanol.  the preferred extractant is an n, n, n -  trialkyl zwitterionic compound, especially an n, n, n - trialkyl  - α -amino acid or an n, n, n - trialkyl amine oxide.  the cell envelope fraction obtained from b.  pertussis is  highly protective against whole bacteria when tested by  standard vaccine mouse potency assay and has a greatly  reduced lipopolysaccharide content compared with either  whole cells or crude cell envelopes, greatly reducing the risk  of undesirable side-effects from vaccination.
