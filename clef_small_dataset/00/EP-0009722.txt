<DESCRIPTION>
detailed description of the invention: the present invention relates to an optically active complex, alanine-ringsubstituted mandelic acid, represented by the general formula: emi1.1 wherein x is p-chloro, p-methoxy, p-methyl or m-nitro, and n is 0 or 1/2 and a method for producing thereof. the object substance of the present invention is novel and is useful as an intermediate when optically active alanine and optically active ring-substituted mandelic acid is produced. hitherto, as a method of optical resolution of alanine there has been a method in which alanine is led to its n-benzoyl derivative and the derivative is in turn led to a slightly soluble salt by the reaction with an expensive alakaloid such as brucine and strychnine, and after removing the alkaloid which is formed by the decomposition of the salt, the thus obtained nbenzoyl derivative is hydrolyzed to obtain the optically active alanine. however, the abovementioned method has unavoidable technical drawbacks. another method has been known in which acylated alanine is optically resolved by aminoacylase, however, since in this method it is necessary to acylize alanine to obtain an acylderivative, this method is unavoidably not advantageous. on the other hand, as a method of optically resolving ring-substituted mandelic acid only one method has been known in which ephedrine is brought into reaction with p-chloromandelic acid and the reaction product is resolved, there are no other known methods for optically resolving other ring-substituted mandelic acid. the inventors formerly have offered a method of optical resolution by the use of a complex of mandelic acid with alanine (german offen. 2812041) and during the study of the combination of ringsubstituted mandelic acid and alanine the inventors have newly found that a ring-substituted -=andelic acid such as that mentioned above forms a complex with alanine and that owing to the difference of solubility between two complexes, when an optically active isomer of one of the pair comprising alanine and ring-substituted mandelic acid is used, racemic compound of the other of the above-mentioned pair is possibly resolved optically, for instance, by using lalanine an optically active ring-substitut:ed mandelic acid is obtained and conversely, hy using optically active ring-substituted mandelic acid an optically active alanine is 'obtained. the present invention has been completed on the above-mentioned findings obtained by the inventors' study. in order to produce the object substance of the present invention, an optically active ring-substituted mandelic acid is-brought into reaction in a solvent with dl-alanine, or optically active alanine is brought into reaction in a solvent with a racemic compound, dl- ring-substituted mandelic acid, to form a complex between the two reactants and then the slightly soluble complex is selectively crystallized out by cooling the solution, by condensing the solution, if necessary, or by adding another solvent which reduce the solubility to effect the separation of the solid and the liquid. on crystallizing out of the complex, addition of so-called seed is not necessarily indispensable, however, a sl.,all amount of the slightly soluble complex may be added in order to accelerate the cr-.stallization.
