<ABSTRACT>
zeolite omega is found to be a unique zeolite-type cata­ lyst for the alkylation of benzene with propylene to form  cumene.  at temperatures below 400°f. , a cumene product  containing less than 200 parts per million (weight) of the  undesirable impurity n-propylbenzene is produced in high  yield and without the unacceptably high rate of catalyst deac­ tivation incurred with other zeolite catalysts.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates in general to the synthesis of cumene by the catalyzed reaction of benzene with propylene, and more particularly, the synthesis of cumene with the formation of minimal amounts of n-propylbenzene impurity. the synthesis process involves the reaction of benzene and propylene in the liquid phase in contact with a zeolite omega catalyst. isopropylbenzene or cumene, as it is commonly known, is currently produced in large volume principally as an intermediate in the production of phenol and acetone which are obtained by the acid catalyzed reaction of cumene with air. n-propylbenzene impurity, which cannot be effectively removed from the cumene, produces propionaldehyde and can become further oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. this leads to autocatalyzed acid activated side reactions that decrease the yield of the desired phenol and acetone. these organic acids are also corrosive toward the processing apparatus. at impurity levels of the order of a few hundred parts per million, the autocatalytic and corrosion problems are not especially serious, but the formation of even the proportionally small amount of propionaldehyde in the acetone product is distinctly disadvantageous when this acetone product is used in the synthesis of organic resins such as polyepoxides. this is mainly because the aldehyde impurity carries through as an undesirable colorant. currently the most widely used commercial scale cumene synthesis route. is the catalytic condensafiof prcess using phosphoric acid on kieselguhr as the heterogeneous catalyst. it is a liquid phase fixed bed process carrier out at temperatures within the range of about 450 to 50oé , at a pressure of about 500-600 psig and using a benzene to propylene molar ratio of from 6 to 8. although generally effective in producing a cumene product containing low amounts of n-propylbenzene, this advantage exacts a high price in equipment corrosion, and catalyst handling problems. the catalyst is itself highly corrosive and necessitates the use of expensive materials of construction for the reactor. precisely controlled amounts of water must be added to the feed to prevent the irreversible conversion of orthophosphoric acid to the meta form with consequent rapid catalyst deactivation. the catalyst also has very low transalkylation activity resulting in a high concentration in the product of poly-substituted alkylaromatics. additionally, upon deactitation, the non-regenerable catalyst undergoes significant agglomeration cuasing a tedious and time-consuming changeout procedure. a less commonly used commercial alternative route to cumene synthesis uses homogeneous aluminum chloride/ hydrochloric acid slurry catalyst. this process has problems of spent catalyst sludge disposal, the need for corrosion resistant materials of construction for process apparatus and complex catalyst-alkylate product separation equipment as well as poor single-pass cumene selectivity. because of the considerable success achieved in other hydrocarbon conversion processes using crystalline zeolite-based catalyst compositions, considerable effort has been expended by many in the field to develop a zeolite catalyst for use in cumene synthesis. although in general, large pore molecular sieve zeolites have been found to catalyze both the direct alkylation of benzene with propylene and the transalkylation of diisopropylbenzene with benzene to form
