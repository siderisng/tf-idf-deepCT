<ABSTRACT>
growth of acinetobacter sp.  atcc 31012 on various sub­ strates and under varying conditions has been used to pro­ duce two classes of extracellular microbial protein-associated  lipopolysaccharides (the "emulsans") which, on a weight-­ for-weight basis, are probably the most efficient emulsifiers  discovered and which possess certain characteristics that  permit these unique extracellular microbial lipopolysac­ charides to be widely used in cleaning oil-contaminated ves­ sels, oil spill management, and enhanced oil recovery by  chemical flooding.  these classes have been named  α-emulsans and β-emulsans, both of which have substan­ tially the same polymer backbone but differ from each other in  certain important structural aspects.  deproteinization of  emulsans by hot phenol extraction produces the lipopolysac­ charide components (the "apoemulsans") of each of such  th emulsans, which components have been shown to be com­ pletely n-acylated and partially o-acylated heteropolysac­ charides made up of a major amounts of d-galactosamine and  an aminouronic acid, the o-lipoacyl portions of such  apoemulsans containing varying percentages of fatty acid  esters in which the fatty acids contain from about 10 to about  18 carbon atoms.  base hydrolysis under mild conditions of  the emulsans and apoemulsans produces derivatives (the  "ψ-emulsans" and apo-ψ-emulsans", respectively) which  are completely n-acylated and partially to completely  o-deacylated.  base hydrolysis under strong conditions of any  of these products produces another derivate (the "proemul­ sans") which is completely o-deacylated and is partially  h-deacylated.  emulsans and apoemulsans, both of which  biopolymers are strongly anionic, exhibit a high degree of  specificity in the emulsification of hydrocarbon substrates  which contain both aliphatic and cyclic components.  in addi­ tion, these extracellular microbial polysaccharides as well as  their o-deacylated and n-deacylated derivatives are adsorbed  on and capable of flocculating aluminosilicate ion-­ exchangers, such as kaolin and bentonite.
