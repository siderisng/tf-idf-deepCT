<ABSTRACT>
the case involves n-pyrazinecarbonyl-n′-substituted-­ sulfamoylguanidines and processes for making the same.   the compounds are depicted in formular i.     wherein   r¹ is hydrogen,   lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl  having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, lower alkenyl having from  2 to 3 carbon atoms;   r² is hydrogen,   lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms;   r¹ and r² can be joined to form, with the nitrogen  atom to which they are attached, a heterocyclic ring having  3 to 6 carbon atoms therein;   r² is hydrogen,   lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms;   r⁴ is hydrogen,   lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl  having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms;   r⁵ is hydrogen,   lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl  having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms;   x is halo;   and the pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid addi­ tion salts thereof.  the compounds are excellent eukalemic agents pos­ sessing diuretic and natriuretic properties.
