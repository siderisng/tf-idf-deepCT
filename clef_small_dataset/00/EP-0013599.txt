<ABSTRACT>
a magesia partially stabilised zirconia ceramic material  possessing from about 2. 8 to about 4. 0 wt per cent magnesia,  and made from a zirconia powder containing no more than  about 0. 03 per cent silica is described.  the ceramic material  has a microstructure, produced as a consequence of the  method by which the material is made, which provides both  high strength and good thermal shock resistance properties.   this microstructure comprises grains of cubic stabilised zirconia  within which are formed, during cooling from the firing  temperature, precipitates of tetragonal zirconia.  these precipitates  are elliptical in shape, with a long axis of about 1500  angstrom units.  additionally, some of the tetragonal zirconia  precipitates are made to transform into a non-twinned microcrystalline  monoclinic form of zirconia by reducing the  temperature of the material to below 800°c, then subsequently  holding the material at a temperature in the range  from 1000°c to about 1400°c.  the ceramic material may also  contain up to 36 wt per cent of hafnia.  such materials can be  used for inter alia moulds, dies, tappet facings and cutting  tools.
