<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to method and apparatus  for substantially reducing the effects of interference at a  receiver between concurrently received first and second digital  signals which use the same freqency spectrum.  interference  between signals is effectively reduced by transmitting  the first digital signal in an uncoded form while concurrently  transmitting the second digital signal with both reduced  capacity when compared with the first signal and in coded  form using a forward error correcting code such as, for  example, a block or convolutional code.  at the receiver intercepting  both digital signals, a suitable detection process is  performed to decode the second signal and separate both  signals.  the present invention is applicable to the simultaneous  satellite transmission of an area coverage beam (12) and a  plurality of spot coverage beams (e. g.  14a) or to increase  capacity on a radio channel.
