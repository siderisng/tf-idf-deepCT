<ABSTRACT>
a character generator for use in photocomposing com­ prises a fibre optic faceplate (23) of which the front face is  polished and bevelled at its leading and trailing edges.  on  the rear surface of the faceplate is a mask which has an array  of apertures each aperture encompassing a multiplicity of  the fibres.  photo-emissive diodes or other illuminators (25)  are approximately aligned with the holes in the mask and are  disposed for connection to terminals 22 on a printed circuit  mounting.  the generator is intended for use in the constitu­ tion of characters by selective illumination of elementary  areas.  the faceplate is intended to be in close proximity to a  film or other radiation sensitive recording medium which is  moved relative to the faceplate to build up lines of composi­ tion.
