<ABSTRACT>
a flat roof-tile (1) made of a ceramic material, cement or the like, has a recess (2) over its central region on the underside of the tile (1) and preferably also a somewhat shallower recess (3) on the upper side, which is aligned with the recess (2) on the underside.  the recesses (2, 3) enable the tile (1) to bend along the recess or recesses.  to prevent the tile (1) from breaking in two on bending, a reinforcement strip (4) made of a stretched metal, such as aluminium, is embedded in the tile material at the recesses (2, 3) and extends over a distance from the recesses (2, 3) into both tile halves on each side of the recesses.  the reinforcement strip (4) is deformed when the tile (1) is bent, and keeps the tile halves at an angle to one another which corresponds to the inclination of the roof ridge.  <image>
