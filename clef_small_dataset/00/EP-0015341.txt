<ABSTRACT>
a process for the production of basic magnesium sul­ phonates comprising carbonating a mixture containing:   (a) an oil soluble sulphonate or sulphonic acid   (b) a stoicheiometric excess of a magnesium com­ pound above that required to react with (a)   (c) a hydrocarbon solvent   (d) a c₁ to c₅ alcohol and/or c₃ to c₆ ketone   (e) water and   (f) a reaction promoter   wherein carbonation is effected between 50° c and the re­ flux temperature of the mixture and is continued until from  80% to 120% of the stoicheiometric amount of carbon di­ oxide required to react with the excess magnesium com­ pound has been passed through the reaction mixture and  for sufficient time to ensure that from 70% to 90% of the car­ bon dioxide theoretically required to convert the excess of  the magnesium compound to magnesium carbonate has  been absorbed by the reaction mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to the production of basic magnesium sulphonates which are particularly useful as additives for lubricating oils and the present invention also provides lubricating oils containing these basic magnesium sulphonates. the term basic magnesium sulphonate is used to describe materials containing a stoichiometric excess of magnesium compared to that required to neutralize the sulphonic acid. basic magnesium sulphonates are well known as is their use as additives for lubricants and many methods have been proposed for their production the preferred techniques being the carbonation of an oil solution of a reaction mixture containing a sulphonic acid or sulphonate, an excess of a magnesium compound generally the alkoxide, oxide or hydroxide, usually a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of reaction promoter systems often comprising an alcohol andlor water sometimes together with a co-promoter. it is important that where the highly basic sulphonates are to be used as additives for lubricating oils they be not too viscous, are free of sediment, are soluble in the oil and do not cause the lubricating oil to be hazy. it is also preferred that they have as high a total base number (tbn), being the number of milligrams of kor equivalent to 1 gram of the product when titrated with strong acid, as possible since this results in the most economic use of the metal. it is also important that the compound perform well as an additive in an oil in use in an engine. many of the earliest techniques proposed for producing magnesium sulphonates required magnesium metal as starting material, as for example in united states patent 3158009. since then various reaction promoter systems have been proposed for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates from magnesium oxide. for example, u.k. patent 1166744 is concerned with the use of mixtures of alcohol, water and amines as promoters; u.k. patent 1297150 describes the use of oil soluble carboxylic acids and water whilst u.k. patent 1399092 relates to the use of amine salts of carboxylic acids, alcohol and water. in each instance, specific process conditions have been proposed for the particular promoter each generally involving complex multi-stage processes or undesirably expensive process conditions. there remains therefore a need for a simple economic process for the production of high tbn (around 400 tbn) magnesium sulphonates which is not dependent on the use of a particular promoter or complex reaction steps. the present invention therefore provides a process for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates comprising carbonating a mixture containing: (a) an oil soluble sulphonate or sulphonic acid (b) a stoicheiometric excess of a magnesium compound above that required to react with (a). (c) a hydrocarbon solvent. (d) a c1 to c5 alcohol and/or a c3 to c6 ketone (e) water and (f) a reaction promoter wherein carbonation is effected between 50 c and the reflux temperature of the mixture and is continued until from 80% to 120% of the stoicheiometric amount of carbon dioxide required to react with the excess magnesium compound has been passed

<CLAIMS>
what we claim is:   1. a process for the production of basic magnesium sulphonates comprising carbonating a mixture containing:  (a) an oil soluble sulphonate or sulphonic acid  (b) a stoicheiometric excess of a magnesium compound  above that required to react with (a)  (c) a hydrocarbon solvent  (d) a c1 to c5 alcohol to a c3 to c6 ketone  (e) water and (f) a reaction promoter    wherein carbonation    is effected between   50 c    and the reflux temperature of the mixture and is continued until from 80% to 120% of the stoicheiometric amount of carbon dioxide required to react with the excess magnesium compound has been passed through the reaction mixture and for sufficient time to ensure that from 70% to 90% of the carbon dioxide theoretically required to convert the excess of the magnesium compound to magnesium carbonate has been absorbed by the reaction   mixture.   2. a process according to claim 1 in which the temperature of the reaction mixture is between 50 and   60 c    at the start of carbonation.   3. a process according to claim 2 in which the temperature of the reaction mixture is between 55 and 700c for the first 1 to 2 hours of carbonation is then held at from   650c    to 750c for a further 1 to 2 hours and is at a temperature between 700c and 550c during the remainder of carbonation.   4. a process according to any of the preceding claims in which the c1 to c5 alcohol is methanol.   5. a process according to any of the preceding claims in which the magnesium compound is magnesium oxide.   6. a process according to claim 5 in which from 0.5 to 2 parts by weight of water based on the total amount of magnesium oxide are used.    7. a process according to claim 5 or claim 6 in which from 0.5 to 4 parts by weight of the alcohol based on the total weight of magnesium oxide are used.     8. a process according to any of the preceding claims in which from 0.02 to 1 part by weight of the promoter based on the total amount of the magnesium compound present is used.   9. a'process according to any of the preceding claims in which the promoter is ethylene diamine.   10. a process according to any of the preceding claims in which the sulphonic acid and the magnesium compound are reacted prior to admixture with the promoter.      11.    a process according to claim 1 substantially as hereinbefore described with particular reference to the accompanying examples.   12. basic magnesium sulphonates whenever produced by a process according to any of the preceding claims.
