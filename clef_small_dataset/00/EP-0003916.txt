<ABSTRACT>
the leukocytosis promoting factor (lpf) of bordetella  haemagglutinin (hg) is separated from crude cell supernatant  or partially purified protein by affinity chromatography  on a column material consisting of an insoluble polymeric  support to which is bound a sialoprotein (containing sialic  acid) or other substance rich in sialic acid.  the sialoprotein  was preferably a plasma sialoprotein such as haptoglobin or  ceruloplasmin or a salivary mucin, and the polymeric support  was preferably an agarose gel, though other conventional  supports could be used.  by this process, on treatment  of an ammonium sulphate precipitated extract, the haemagglutinating  activity may be increased 300-600 fold over the  extract and 10,000 times over the crude centrifuged cell  supernatant.  alternatively a fraction substantially free from  lpf-hg may be collected.  pertussis lpf-hg is reported to have various useful clinical  properties, in particular adjuvant effect on antigenicity  and the abilities to induce leukocytosis and sensitivity to histamine.   by the process of the present invention lpf-hg may  be produced cheaply and in large quantities or removed  from other cell extracts.
