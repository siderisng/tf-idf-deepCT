<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a low wash and rinse  temperature 49째 - 60째c (120째 -.  140째f) warewasher, reducing  loss of productivity resulting from time lost between completion  of washing and commencement of rinsing a given load of  ware.  this object is achieved by means of a warewasher (10)  incorporating independent, dedicated wash and rinse systems,  the latter of which includes a holding tank (25) which  enables independent batching of a predetermined volume of  rinse solution from properly proportioned fresh water and  sanitizing agent while washing a given load of ware.  the  sanitizing agent is introduced independently into the holding  tank and independently of the fresh water line (27,28), and is  therefore unaffected by a great range of water line pressures  and teh mineral conditions of the water.
