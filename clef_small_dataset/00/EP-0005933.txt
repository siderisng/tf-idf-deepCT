<ABSTRACT>
a manifold for an internal combustion engine comprises  a plurality of body parts (1,12,17) each formed as an integral  casting preferably by pressure casting.  a first body part (1)  has a mounting flange (2) for the manifold, a plurality of  open channels (6) communicating with respective apertures  (4) in the mounting flange, and a water chamber (8)  communicating with a port (9) in the flange and a further port  (10) in the first body part.  a second body part (12) overlies  the channels so that the first and second body parts define a  plurality of gas conduits effecting communication between  the apertures and a common orifice (7).  the first and second  parts are sealed together along opposed side faces (22,25)  adjacent their outer peripheral edges, rather than along  abuting end faces.  this allows access to the joints from the  exterior of the assembly, permitting connection by electron  beam welding or an adhesive, since all the joints are located  on the exterior of the assembly a smooth interior surface is  preserved and visual inspection of each joint is possible as it  is made.
