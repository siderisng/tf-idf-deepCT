<ABSTRACT>
a catalyst useful for conversion of synthesis gas to naph足 tha is prepared by carbon of monoxide treatment of a single  particle composite of iron oxide, hydrogel matrix and crystal足 line zeolite having a silica/alumina ratio greater than 12 and a  constraint index of 1 to 12.  the iron oxide is present in the  composite as a powder, and may be created in situ by oxida足 tion of iron powder.  the carbon monoxide may be a compo足 nent of synthesis gas.  the product naphtha is characterised  by specific details of boiling range and composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of preparing a syltithesis cas conversion catalyst and use of catalyst so prepared this invention is concerned with a method of preparing a synthesis gas (defined as mixtures of gaseous carbon oxides with hydrogen or hydrogen donors) conversion catalyst and to its use for the conversion of synthesis gas to naphtha. processes for the conversion of coal and other hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, to a gaseous mixture consisting essentially of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and/or dioxide are well known. those of major importance depend either on the partial combustion of the fuel with an oxygen-containing gas, on the high temperature reaction of the fuel with steam, or on a combination of these two reactions. an excellent summary of the art of gas manufacture, including synthesis gas, from solid and liquid fuels is given in encyclopedia of chemical technology, edited by kirk-othmer, second edition, volume 10, pages 353-433 (1 966), interscience publishers, new york, new york. it is also well known that synthesis gas will undergo conversion to reduction products of carbon monoxide, such as hydrocarbons, at from about 148.s80c (3000f) to about 454.440c (8500f), under from about one to one thousand atmospheres pressure, over a fairly wide variety of catalysts. the fischer-tropsch process, for example, which has been most extensively studied, produces a range of liquid hydrocarbons, a portion of which have been-used as low octane gasoline. catalysts that have been studied for this and related processes include those based on iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, thorium, rhodium and osmium, or their oxides. recently, it has been discovered that the conversion of synthesis gas into valuable products can be greatly enhanced by employing a special type of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite exemplified by zsm-5 in admixture with a carbon monoxide reduction catalyst. thus, for example, united states specification 4,086,262, discloses a process for the conversion of syngas by passing the same at elevated temperature over a catalyst which comprises an intimate mixture of a fischer-tropsch component and a special type of zeolite such as zsm-5, and points out that the products produced. are hydrocarbon mixtures which are useful in the manufacture of heating oil, high octane gasoline, aromatic compounds, and chemical intermediates. although that specification is primarily directed to multi-particle composite catalysts, i.e., the crystalline aluminosilicate component (one particle) is physically admixed with the fischer-tropsch component (another particle) it's example 5 does disclose a single particle iron-containing catalyst in an alumina matrix. the patent and technical literature relating to the fischer-tropsch process is extensive and the various catalysts reported in the prior art have been used by themselves as well as in admixture with catalytically inactive supports such as kieselguhr. although the reasons for using catalytically inactive supports have varied, it appears that one reason for using them was increased surface area of the fischer-tropsch component, another the control of the heat-requirements of the overall exothermic reactions. it is also known in the art to admix a fischer-tropsch component with a material such as silica-alumina which is known to be
