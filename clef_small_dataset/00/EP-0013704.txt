<ABSTRACT>
a bearing (6) having an elastomer body for the torsionally resilient bearing of rocking levers, particularly of tensioning levers (15) carrying a tensioning roller (17) for motor vehicle engine drive-belt tensioners, having a cylindrical inner part (9, 29), an outer part, surrounding the inner part (9, 29), which can be connected, or is connected, to a rocking lever or tensioning lever (15), and an elastomer body, filling the space between the inner part (9, 29) and the outer part, and transferring circumferential forces.  to produce a bearing of the previously mentioned type, that has a flat characteristic of the restoring torque and which, when used for a drive-belt tensioner makes adjustment of the bearing superfluous throughout the life of the drive-belt, the output end (11, 32) of a spiral strip (8, 27), connected to the inner part (9, 29) and spaced apart from the turns, forms the outer part, and the elastomer body fills the space enclosed by the spiral strip (8, 27) in the form of an elastomer spiral (13, 33), adhesively bonded to the spiral strip (8, 27).  <image>
