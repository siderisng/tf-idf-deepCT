<ABSTRACT>
a process for making objects from a mixture of a thermosetting resin, mineral fillers, an alkali metal oxide, and hardener, in which process at least two different materials are prepared that are of substantially the same composition but contain different hardener components.  the first material contains at least two hardener components that do not form enough free radicals to effect rapid hardening of the material but do rapidly form free radicals when mixed with the hardener components of the other material.  the two materials are, in pasty condition, divided into small portions, whereupon these portions are mixed, the mixture is given the desired shape, and the object thus formed is hardened.
