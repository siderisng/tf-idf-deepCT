<ABSTRACT>
a burner (10) for soaking pit furnaces produces essentially  complete combustion of the gas and air mixed in  the burner.  the burner includes a tubular inner wall structure  (16) and an outer housing (22) spaced from the inner  wall to form a hollow interior (26) between the inner wall  and the housing.  the inner wall terminates adjacent a surrounding  portion (31) of the housing to form a narrow  opening (30) from the hollow interior which extends around  the periphery of the inner wall structure.  a gas supply pipe  (32) located in th hollow interior surrounds the inner  wall structure (16) and directs the flow of gas under pressure  toward the narrow peripheral opening (30).  the inner  wall (16) forms an air supply pipe and air is forced under  pressure through the air supply pipe and past the narrow  opening.
