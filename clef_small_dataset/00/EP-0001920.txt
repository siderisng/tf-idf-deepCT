<ABSTRACT>
vincaleukoblastine derivates of the formula    wherein   r² is ch₃ or cho;   when taken singly, r⁵ is h and one of r³ and r⁴ is oh or h  and the other is c₂h₅ and when r⁴ and r⁵ are taken together,  they form an α-epoxide ring r³ is c₂h₅, when taken singly r⁶  is h and r⁷ is or¹ and when r⁶ and r⁷ are taken together they  are =0;   r¹ is h or acetyl; and   r is och₃ or nh-nh₂ with the proviso that if r is -nh-nh₂,  r¹ is h; or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt  thereof, are prepared by reduction of the corresponding  4-desacetoxy-4-oxo derivatives which in turn were prepared  by the oxidation of the corresponding 4-desacetyl-4β-hydroxy  derivatives.  the compounds are useful as antimitotic agents.
