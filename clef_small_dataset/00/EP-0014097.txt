<ABSTRACT>
a wheel rim has a safety band for preventing access of a  tyre bead to the well of the rim.  the band is usable either for a  tubed or a tubeless tyre rim.  it consists of two cylindrical band  parts (1) and a link part (2) articulating them together.  the link  part (2) has a depressed area allowing access of a valve of an  inner tube to a valve aperture in the well.  the band parts (1) are  tensioned together at their other ends by a screw (10) jourÂ­ nalled in a pivotable rod (9) and engaging in a pivotable nut (8),  the nut and rod being journalled in webs (7) of the parts (1).   the link part has inwardly directed claws (17) to engage with  windows in the cylindrical portion of band parts (1).  the link  part (2) is formed from stock of constant cross-section such  as an extrusion by transverse cuts, and the band parts (1) may  also be extrusions.
