<ABSTRACT>
Radiator valves, often thermostatic Gerge-based radiator valves, are very often fully completely up or down. As a result, it happens to an unnecessarily high room temperature and thus for the waste of energy. In a radiator valve with a setting range of at most approximately one revolution now intended that at a predetermined from the rotating position different rotational position either the rotation-inhibition is made more difficult or blocked. The rotation inhibition can suddenly or gradually be done and be consistent or variable. In the case of blocking, a triggering adjusting auxiliary device (6) is provided. As soon as the user detects the rotation-inhibition or blocking of the rotary handle, it is reminded that it should make the further rotation and thus determination of a higher room temperature ratur only specifically. The blocking is achieved in that a rotation firmly connected to an undue component of the valve connected, stationary device part with a rotatably rotatably connected to the rotatable rotatable device part for the formation of the adjusting auxiliary device (6) cooperates. Advantageous is the use of a stop and an opposite stop. Conveniently, the rotatable stop member is brought into its release position by means of a shutter button (5), for example, an outside access button. In one, for example from 1 to 5 reaching scale, the blocking can be assigned to the scale value (3) lying in the middle.
