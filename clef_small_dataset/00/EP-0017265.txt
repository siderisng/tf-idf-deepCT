<ABSTRACT>
a soil fumigant composition comprising dichlorop­ ropene, optionally together with one or more related chlorin­ ated alkane/alkene components and/or more other nemati­ cides, and, as a stabilizer therefor, at least 0. 2 percent, by  weight thereof, of a non-nucleophilic, oleophilic aliphatic  epoxide, such as an epoxidised drying oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
"stabilisation of soil fumigant comositions consisting of or containing 1,3-dichlororronene" this invention is concerned with the stabilisation of soil fumigant compositions consisting of or containing 1,3-dichloropropene. typical examples of such compositions are the mixtures of the isomeric 1,3-dichioropropenes used as soil fumigants for the control of soil-dwelling nematodes. as supplied commercially such compositions usually contain chlorinated alkanes, such as 1,2-dichloropropane, and other chlorinated alkenes, such as 3,3dichloropropene; they can also contain other nematicides. such commercial compositions are usually stored and transported in metal (usually iron) containers. when in contact with the metal, particularly during storage at high temperatures, such compositions if not stabilised discolour and darken; and they are also corrosive to the metal. these effects are intensified by the small amount of moisture which inevitably is present during the course of routine manufacture, storage and handling. with increasing awareness of environmental considerations a growing need has arisen in the art for a stabiliser which is not only suitable for the intended purpose, but is substantially nontoxic and non-degradable (or reactable in the composition) to toxic products. it now has been found that when a small amount of a nonnucleophilic oleophilic aliphatic epoxide is incorporated as a stabiliser in such a composition discoloration of the composition when in contact with iron can be eliminated; corrosivity of the mixture with respect to iron can be significantly reduced, and the above-mentioned effect of water can also be significantly reduced. moreover, such epoxides are essentially non-toxic, at least two commercially available classes of such epoxides having been approved by the envirormental protection agency and the -food and drug administration; they are chemically stable and do not degrade in use to form any noxious material; they are not reactive with air and/or moisture, or any of the components normally present in the compositions to which they are added; they are non-volatile; they are physically compatible with the components of such compo- sitions and with other soil fumigants, such as other halogenated alkanes (e.g. ethylene dibromide), or chloropicrin and with the usual surfactants that may be included in the compositions; and they are readily available commercially at a cost which m-*es an effective dosage economically feasible. surprisingly, it has also been found that these epoxide stabilisers have the unexpected desirable property that, at the temperatures usually encountered during storage and handling of the compositions, the oxirane oxygen content of a composition containing the epoxide is not significantly reduced with passage of time. this is unexpected, for when epichiorohydrin (the con ventional stabiliser) is used, the oxirane oxygen content of the composition drops as time passes, and this fact has had to be taken into account when determining the amount of epichlorohydrin to be added at the outset. 1 ,3-dichloropropene exists in two isomeric (e- and z-) forms, the z-isomer being more toxic to nematodes than the w-isomer. 1,3-dichloropropene is manufactured by chlorination of propylene. consequently, the commercial products ordinarily contain mixtures of the isomers, together with related chlorinated alkane/ alkene components, that is one or
