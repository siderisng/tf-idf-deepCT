<ABSTRACT>
a keyless chuck adapted to grip an object, such as a drill  bit, is disclosed.  the keyless chuck includes a cylindrical body  (8) provided with an axially extending tapered bore (9).  the  surface (11) of the tapered bore (9) includes first and second  cam surfaces (56,57).  a control sleeve (14) is provided sur­ rounding at least a portion of the cylindrical body (8) and is  adapted for controlled axial movement relative to the cylin­ drical body (8).  a retaining element (29) is attached to the  control sleeve (14) and partially closes one end of the cylindri­ cal body (8).  a thrust bearing (36) is provided in the retaining  element (29).  gripping elements (23) are positioned within the  tapered bore (9) and are adapted to engage and grip the tool  (24) when the tool (24) is inserted between the gripping ele­ ments (23).  a thrust bearing (36) is positioned in the retaining  element (29) which operatively engages the gripping ele­ ments (23).  a spring (26) retains the gripping elements (23) in  contact with the tapered bore (9) and also with the thrust  bearing (36) wherein, upon axial movement of the control  sleeve (14) relative to the cylindrical body (8), the gripping  elements (23) move axially within the tapered bore (9) in  contact with the first cam means (57), thereby causing radial  movement of the gripping elements (23) and wherein, upon  rotation of the cylindrical body (8) relative to the gripping  elements (23), the gripping elements (23) shift along the sur­ face of the second cam (56) and thereby also cause radial  movement of the gripping elements (23).
