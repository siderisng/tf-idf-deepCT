<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for treating a patient by means of water  sprays which includes a horizontal cylinder (10) which is  open at one end and closed at the other.  nozzles (20,30 and  34) are provided for directing sprays of water and/or steam  into the interior of the vessel.  a pump (78), a water heater  (80) and a steam generator (82) are provided and are  connected to the nozzles by tubing.  the patent lies on a  trolley (40) which has a wheeled base (46).  vertical columns  (44) at one end of the base support two elongate side  members (42) which overlie the base and between which a  mesh or synthetic plastics sheet extends to support a prone  patient.  the trolley is oscillated horizontally to move the  patient relatively to the nozzles by means of a crank  arrangement (60,62) driven by an electric motor (56).
