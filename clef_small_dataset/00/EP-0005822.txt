<ABSTRACT>
in order to ensure in a sheet handling apparatus, such as a folding apparatus or the like, having at least two product routes (3, 4), which are formed by mutually branching belt sections (5, 8; 6, 10) and are alternately releasable or closable by means of a switch arranged at the branching and having a movable shutter (11), that the switch can be operated in any desired manner and can be left in one or other position for any desired time and that, nevertheless, breaks in operation for reversing the switch are unnecessary, a servo motor (19) is provided for the drive of the shutter (11), which motor can be operated by means of a control device (20) which can be activated by means of an appropriate reversing pulse (21) independently of the machine running and whose servomotor-side control output (23) is releasable by a sensor (22) preceding the shutter (11) and picking up the succession of products or gaps at the moment at which the shutter (11) lies open during the passage of a gap between two successive products in each case.  <image>
