<ABSTRACT>
a time-division switching system for switching data  words from data word sources received in channels of a ti­ me-multiplex line where a first plurality of data word sour­ ces uses a channel only once every n channels and a se­ cond plurality of data word sources uses a channel once  every m channels where m is less than n and n is not an  integer multiple of m.  the switching system operates in re­ sponse to control words sequentially provided by a control  word source.  the control word source of the disclosed em­ bodiment comprises a first storage arrangement having n  storage locations for storing control words and a second  storage arrangement having m storage locations for storing  control words.  a storage reading circuit substantially simul­ taneously reads the contents of one storage location of  both storage arrangements sequentially.  a selection arran­ gement receives the control words from the storage read­ ing circuit and transmits a predetermined one of the two  control words se read to the time-division switching system  for control thereof.
