<ABSTRACT>
The device and method for fixing a micro wafer (14) on a module (12) using weld balls (15) use a chamber (10) filled with an inert atmosphere pierced with a transparent window (16) through which one drops on the upper surface of the micro wafer a radiation (31) of a laser beam (29).The laser is chosen in such a way that, for the wavelength of the radiation, the surface of the microplacquet is substantially opaque.The wavelength of the radiation is in the infra-red.Its intensity is adjusted with a detector (36) connected to a programmed control system (38) acting on the laser (26).This device makes it possible to avoid thermal damage to the microplaquettes and can be used for the attachment of microplaquettes replacing defective microplaquettes.
