<ABSTRACT>
a sprocket for a cycle having a plurality of circumferen­ tally disposed teeth (2) and especially a sprocket suitable for  use in a multisprocket arrangement used for driving the cycle  and changing gear.  in order to minimize weight and production costs whilst  at the same time providing satisfactory durability the sprocket  body (1) is formed of a lightweight low wear resistance mater­ ial with a recessed peripheral portion (11) whereby at least  one tooth (2) is omitted.  a toothed member (4) of a material of  greater wear resistance is provided in said recessed portion  (11) with at least one tooth (3) so as to replace said omitted  tooth (2).
