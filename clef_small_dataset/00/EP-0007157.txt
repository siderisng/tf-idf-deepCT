<ABSTRACT>
an electrode array 10 specifically for implantation into the human cochlea comprising a biologically inert tube 20 about which is formed a number of electrodes 13 each of which is associated with an insulated conducting wire 14 which passes through a slot 16 in the tube 20 and at one end thereof; the electrodes each being formed of a strip of thin foil and lie substantially within the diameter of the tube 20, the inner end 12 of which is tapered for easy insertion into the cochlea and to minimise trauma during the insertion procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved electrode array this invention relates to an improved electrode array and in particular to an array adapted for surgical implantation and specifically for implantation in the human cochlea. the cochlea is a spiral bone in the temporal bone which contains the organ and nerves of hearing by which sound is perceived and, at the present time, in various countries of the world, attempts are being made to directly stimulate the auditory nerves in the cochlea so that a person suffering from nerve deafness can "hear". in order to stimulate the nerves it is necessary to insert at least one electrode in the cochlea and this insertion can be done through the round window or by drilling a hole into the cochlea. we consider that it is desirable to stimulate the nerves at various spaced positions along the length of the cochlea as the different frequencies perceived by a person with normal hearing are developed by stimulation of various nerves along the cochlea. the locations of these nerves have a relationship with the frequency perceived and, thus, it is essential to use an electrode array with electrodes at the required spaced positions and which, in itself, can be passed along the spiral of the cochlea. there have been previous forms of electrode arrays proposed, one of which was a stranded wire array in which electrodes were formed by the termination of the wires at various positions along the length of the array, the terminated wire being stripped and spirally wound around the other wires of the array. such stranded electrodes provided the necessary electronic properties and, to a greater or lesser extent, the requited mechanical properties . these electrodes were not 2atijàctory as it was i±:ft to form them with a smooth outer surface and l#flon they tended to cause traur#a. there have also b en proposed sputtered arrays but it has been difficult and expen¯lve to attempt to manufacture such arrays as they need s of a very advanced form of technology. it is an object of the invention to provide an electrode array which is sufficiently flexible to able to be passed around the spiral of the cochlea ç;n¯- @@@@@@ being sufficiently stiff to be fed and which has #;#####-###s spaced at predetermined spacings which electrodes are adapted to contact the nerve endings in the cochlea. the invention includes an electrode arrav comprising a flexible biologically inert tube, a number of electrodes being conducting bands located predetermined spaced distances along portion of the length of the tube, the electrodes lying, generally, within the diameter of the tube and a conducting wire associated with each electrode and passing to the interior of the tube through a slot, aperture or the like in the tube at a position beneath the associated electrode to which the wire is connected and along the leng of the tube to one end thereof. if required the tube may be filled comdie:ely or in part with a material with appropriate mechanical properties. preferably each electrode
