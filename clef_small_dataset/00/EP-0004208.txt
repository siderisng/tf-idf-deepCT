<ABSTRACT>
a folding wheelchair has side frame (1 and 2) connected  by front, rear and bottom toggle braces (3, 4 and 5) which in  the folded position permit the side frames to come together.   each toggel brace is preferably formed from a pair of  u-shaped elements (20, 21) hingeably connected at the base  of the u, the toggle braces co-operating with the framework  such that folding is initiated by lifting upwardly of the bottom  toggle brace (8).  this is best achieved by a rigid rod (23)  linking the front and rear toggle braces (3 and 4) and carrying  abutment means (24) for engaging with the bottom toggle  brace (8) so that folding of the front and rear toggle braces (3  and 4) cannot occur until the bottom toggle brace (8) is lifted.   the wheelchair may have at least one toggle brace of  u-shaped members with the base of each u divided transversely  to provide for relative rotational motion between the  portions of each u-shaped member.  the wheelchair may  also have a novel folding footrest (40 to 47).
