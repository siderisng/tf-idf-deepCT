<ABSTRACT>
an accumulator conveyor in which the articles are  transported on a bed of carried rollers (12) driven by a prop­ elling member in the form of a cable (14).  beneath the cable a  plurality of devices (20), arranged in tandem lengthwise of  the conveyor, provide vertical support for the cable (14).   each support has a bracket (21) pivotally mounted between  its ends with a pulley (27) at one end and a tracking roller (39)  at the other end.  the tracking roller (39) is tapered and is  mounted for rotation about a shaft (45) extending trans­ versely of the propelling member.  the shaft (45) is longer  than the roller (39) permitting the tracking roller (39) a limited  amount of axial travel.  by changing the angular relationship  between the roller (39) and cable (14), the point of contact  between the cable (14) and tracking roller (39) is shifted  lengthwise of the roller (39), resulting in pivotal movement of  the bracket (21) which raises and lowers the cable (14) to  effect drive and release of the carrier rollers (12) forming the  conveyor bed.  article actuated sensors shift a longitudinally  extending bar (46) to control the angular position of the track­ ing roller (39).
