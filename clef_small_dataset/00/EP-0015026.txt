<ABSTRACT>
The annealing lamp has an inner, the charging thread assembly (18) closely closing, thick-wall gene and heat-insulating glass piston (10), which serves to heat storage in the interior (16) and for reflection of the heat radiation, and a inner glass piston (10) to form of a gap surrounding outer glass pistons (12). The thick-walled inner glass piston (10) can withstand increased internal pressure and absorb a large part of the heat radiation, so that in the interior space very high temperatures can form, which lead to an optimal light output. To increase the dimensional stability of the inner glass piston (10), a reinforcement (28) of Wol Framfaden may be provided in the material. To improve the we strength is further applied to its outer side an infrared radiation reflective filter layer (32) and its inner wall is formed irregularly for the purpose of enlarging the inner wall surface. Also, the inner glass piston (10) may be provided with narrow passage openings (30) which allow pressure equalization. A filling of the room (14) between the inner and outer glass piston with an infrared radiation absorbing gas such as carbon dioxide XID and / or water vapor improves the thermal insulation. A similar effect can be achieved by the fact that the inner glass piston made of foam glass with carbon dioxide inclusions. There may also be more than two ineanan designed glass flasks.
