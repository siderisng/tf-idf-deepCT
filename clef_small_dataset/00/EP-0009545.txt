<ABSTRACT>
improved recovery of acrylic acid from a gaseous reactor  effluent produced from the catalytic vapor phase oxidation of  propylene or acrolein is accomplished by first quenching the  reactor effluent, thereby forming vapor and liquid streams,  indirectly cooling the vapor stream to condense a second  liquid stream, and passing said second liquid stream to the  quench system as the quench liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
acrylic acid recovery with recycle quench background of the invention acrylic acid is produced by the catalytic vapor phase oxidation of propylene or acrolein with molecular oxygen. acrylic acid may be formed directly from acrolein using catalyst such as found in u.s. 3,736,354 and 3,644,509. acrylic acid may also be formed from propylene in a one or two-stage operation. although directed to the production of esters, u.s. 4,060,545 discloses catalyst that are effective to convert propylene directly to acrylic acid or to convert propylene to acrolein which is then reacted to acrylic acid. the catalyst used in these processes are known as activated oxide complexes. the temperature of the reaction is typically between 300-6000c. the ratio of reactants may vary widely depending on whether propylene or acrolein is used as feed. steam can be added to the reactor to increase selectivity of the catalyst.-the reaction produces a gaseous reactor effluent containing acrylic acid, acrolein, water and various impurities. these impurities consist of such components as acetic acid and inert gases. in order to effectively recover acrylic acid, it is first necessary to obtain the acrylic acid in an aqueous solution suitable for later purification. the prior art has attempted this in a variety of ways. as described in the prior art section of- u.s. 3,926,7li, the gaseous reactor effluent is first cooled by using a liquid which is obtained by recycling cooled constituents of the condensate from this first step as a quenching liquid. this process has several disadvantages in that polymers deposit in the equipment, and the equipment size must be relatively large to handle both the quench liquid and the aqueous solution of acrylic acid. the above reference presents another solution to the formation of an aqueous acrylic acid solution by utili zing organic materials such as hexyl alcohol in the quench system to decrease the formation of polymers and aid in the separation of acrolein. u.s. 3,717,675 discloses a process wherein the reaction gas is first indirectly cooled to a temperature of 100-2000c, and the pre-cooled gases are then scrubbed with water to a temperature between 300 and 90 c. this process suffers from the disadvantage of requiring an extremely large indirect heat exchanger to handle the total gaseous reactor effluent. the present invention reduces the size of equipment involved, and improves the recovery of acrylic acid from the gaseous reactor effluent by means of a-unique quench recycle. summary of the invention it has been discovered that the recovery of acrylic acid can be improved in the process for the recovery of acrylic acid from a gaseous reactor effluent containing acrylic acid, acrolein, water and impurities produced from the catalytic vapor phase oxidation of propylene or acrolein comprising the steps of: a) quenching the gaseous reactor effluent with a quench liquid wherein a first liquid stream containing acrylic acid and a first vapor stream containing acrylic acid are formed; b) indirectly cooling said first vapor stream to form a second liquid stream containing acrylic acid and a
