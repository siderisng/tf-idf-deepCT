<ABSTRACT>
a use in human therapy (viz as an active ingredient  for inhibiting tooth decay) has been found for chloro­ deoxysucrose derivatives of the general formula    (wherein: r4α is a hydroxy group and r4β is a hydrogen  atom, or, one of r4α and r4β is a hydrogen atom and  the other is a chlorine atom; r⁶ is a hydroxy group or,  if at least one of r4α, r4β or r¹′, is a chlorine atom,  then it is a hydroxy group or a chlorine atom; r¹′, is a  hydroxy group or a chlorure atom; and r⁶′ is a hydroxy  group, or if at least one of r4α, r4β or r¹′ is a chlorine  atom, then it is a hydroxy group or a chlorine atom).   compounds and dental or other compositions for  such use are claimed, as well as methods for making  the compositions.
