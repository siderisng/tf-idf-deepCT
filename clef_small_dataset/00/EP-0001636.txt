<ABSTRACT>
1.  exposure device for color-enlargement or copying machines which have color-filters for the color correction of the copying light, which can partially be introduced into the path of the copying light beam, whereby to alter the luminosity of the copying light a diaphragm is provided which can be introduced normally to the direction of motion of said color filter into the path of the copying light beam, and of which the effective size in the beam's path alters with its depth of penetration into the beam's path, characterized in that said diaphragm (6a, 6b, 7a, 7b) is so designed that apart from said effective size, the effective form in the beam's path also changes with the depth of penetration into the beam's path of said diaphragm, and in such a manner that in essence on alteration of the existing color combination of the copying light is effected by the color filters (3, 4, 5), when the luminosity of the copying light is changed by the alteration of the penetration depth of said diaphragm into the beam's path.
