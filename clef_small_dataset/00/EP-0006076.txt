<ABSTRACT>
1.  a lift with a self-contained cab for climbing a mast, and having a frame in which there are mounted the cab, gripping devices to effect the raising of the frame and the cab, and locking devices to lock the lift at any given level on the mast, these devices comprising two elements, one of which is attached rigidly to the frame while the other is connected to the said frame in such a way that it is able to move sequentially by translation in the longitudinal direction of the mast, characterised in that each of these elements (2, 4 and 35, 36) is formed by a fork which has three pneumatic or hydraulic jacks (19, 19' and 47, 48, 49) to bring them successively into a locking position in which they grip round the said mast in three regions evenly distributed over the peripheral surface of this mast, and in that the lift is equipped with control devices which are adapted to supply the three jacks of each of these forks in sequence, the gripping devices of the upper fork and the locking devices of the lower fork successively effecting the function of locking the lift in position.
