<ABSTRACT>
An LSI monolithic integrated semiconductor circuit consisting of sequential circuits and combination circuits includes a considerable number of than (SRS), which are summarized for error testing to a shift register. If such a derailleur is subjected to an error test set up from several minimally replaceable units, then appreciating additional effort in the form of additional connecting points and pins on a module representing the minimum replaceable unit. Thanks to slight modification of the respective input scarf device (5) in the minimum interchangeable units (2) those initially set by appropriate pulse control in the first shift register stages (SRS1, SRS2) of a respective minimum replaceable unit (2) in mutually complementary states. Then, the sliding register contents is evaluated in a conventional manner, wherein the bit points shown in each case by the first two shift register stages (SRS1, SRS2) in all minimum replacement of baren units at the sliding output (12) are examined for bit equality. If bit equality is detected; Then it can be concluded that the immediately preceding mini times exchangeable unit has a continuous error. After replacing the erroneous minimum interchangeable one owe, the continuous test is repeated to be able to detect passage errors even before this minimum replaceable unit.
