<ABSTRACT>
A gear change device for load switching gear is proposed, in which the torque transition is controlled electronically during gear change. For this purpose, when introducing a switching process, the drive motor is controlled in high switching operations and highly regulated when reclosing operations. If the transmission is synchronously, the switching process is terminated. The switching of the required gear shift valves is positively overlapping at the end of the switching process and at the end of the switching process at the beginning of the switching process and in the case of a thrust and load feedback. In addition, the switching operation is forcibly stopped when the vehicle speed is too high when the vehicle speed decreases too much or increases too much in the case of recovering operations or when a predetermined switching time is exceeded. In addition, during the switching process, the main pressure in the transmission depending on the switching type of a safety value set during the driving operation is lowered to a lower constant value.
