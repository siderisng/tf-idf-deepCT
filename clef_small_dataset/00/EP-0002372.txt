<ABSTRACT>
a liquid such as crude oil or fuel is stored in a  subterranean pool (1) covered with a diaphragm-like cover  plate (7) sealingly applied thereto.  on the cover plate is  superimposed a protective body (17, 18) consisting of sand,  soil, stones, rubbish, rocks or mixtures thereof.  the protective  body may be level with the terrain or be projecting  thereabove.  inside the pool a pressure is established hydraulically  or pneumatically equal to that exerted by the  protective body on the cover plate and in this way the  protective body is sustained via the cover plate.  for the  hydraulic method a pressurized working liquid is used, e. g.   water.  for the pneumatic method a compressed gas is used  such as air, a combustion gas, an inert gas or a paraffin gas.   various methods for mounting the cover plate are disclosed.
