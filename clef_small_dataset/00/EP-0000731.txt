<ABSTRACT>
In an electrical cable (1) with an electrically conductive soul (2) insulated by a continuous sheath (4), electrical branches are formed at any desired location, in which in the shell (4) at the desired branching pointSmall incision is introduced, which goes through to the soul (2).In this incision, one or more conductors (8, 9) are then inserted into the formation of the branch between the shell (4) and the soul (2).If the turnoff is formed from two conductor pieces, these are inserted opposite to each other.The conductor portion ends (10, 11) projecting from the cable shell are bent at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the cable.The foregoing ends (10, 11) of two conductors are electrically connected to each other.
