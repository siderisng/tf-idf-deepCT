<ABSTRACT>
a drill boom arrangement comprises a boom proper that  is universally pivotably carried by a boom support.  the  boom carries a feed beam for a rock drill.  the boom is  swingable on the support by means of two hydraulic  cylinders forming a tripod and the feed beam is swingable on  the boom by means of two hydraulic cylinders forming  another tripod.  one of the boom swinging cylinders (17) is  coupled in series with one of the feed beam swinging  cylinders (28) and these two cylinders are actuated by means  of a common direction control valve (58).  the boom  swinging cylinder (17) can be short-circuited so that the feed  beam can be swung upon actuation of the direction control  valve (58) while the boom is arrested.  the other boom  swinging cylinder (16) is coupled in series with the other feed  beam swinging cylinder (29) to a common direction control  valve (57) in the same way.  a joy-stick (59) is coupled to the  two direction control valves (57, 58) through pilot valves and  pilot lines (64-67).
