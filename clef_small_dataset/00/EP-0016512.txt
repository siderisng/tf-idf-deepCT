<ABSTRACT>
a strand break-out device for preventing the formation of  fault yarns due to strand breakage when two unspun fibrous  strands are spun on a common twisting spindle.  a member  (24) has pins (38) forming a passage means to which the  strands converge during travel to the spindle and on which  the strands may bear to apply force to the member.  the  member is pivotally mounted on a support (28) so that it may  move freely on the support between limits of displacement  from a mean, stable disposition.  if a strand breaks the force  applied by the remaining strand moves the member beyond  the respective limit whereupon the member moves to a  further position wherein the pins distort the path that the  remaining strand would otherwise take.  this distortion is  such as to cause the remaining strand to break.
