<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a siphon 8 which reminds a reservoir 1, supplied via a valve 2, to a collector container 14. A tubing 4 extends the tank upwards and carries a level control probe 16 located just at the level.-Desus of the siphon 8. A second probe 22 is placed at the exit of the siphon.The two probes are electrically connected to the control of the valve so as to cause its closure when the liquid reaches the level control probe 16, and to prohibit its opening as long as the probe receives from the liquid from the siphon.The amount of liquid spilled with each opening of the valve is thus always strictly the same.Application to the preparation of precise and adjustable concentration mixture, such as the milk and water powder mixture.
