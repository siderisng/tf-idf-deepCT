<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to self cross-linking aqueous emul­ sion coating compositions comprising an emulsion polymer  emulsified in water, and methods for their production.  the  emulsion polymer comprises copolymerised monomers  including at least about 3 percent by weight of a c₂-c₈ satu­ rated alcohol ether of a monoethylenically unsaturated  n-methylol functional monomer.  the monomers making up  the emulsion copolymer are emulsified during copolymerisa­ tion by a polycarboxylic acid emulsifying agent which is par­ tially neutralised with a volatile base to provide a ph of at least  about 4.
