<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a process for the generation of  gas mixtures containing co and h₂ by the partial oxidation of  a hydrocarbonaceous fuel at elevated temperature and pres­ sure.  power is generated by expanding the hot raw gas from  generator (1) through an expansion turbine (50), after separat­ ing solids from the hot raw gas and diluting the hot raw gas  with steam or liquid water, or with recycled purified process  gas from line (43).  the expanded gas from turbine (50) may be  purified in purification zones (63, 75, 83) and compressed in  compressors (54) and (55).  purified gas product is removed  through lines (109) or (119), and a portion may be recycled  through line (45) to provide diluent in line (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
partial oxidation process with generation of power this invention relates to a partial oxidation process for making gaseous mixtures comprising h2 and co in a gas generator and simultaneously generating power by direct expansion of all of the moderated effluent gas stream from the gas generator in a turbine. the temperature of the effluent gas stream from a partial oxidation gas generator is normally reduced to a temperature in the range of 176 to 3150c (350 to 6000f) by quenching in a pool of water, or by cooling by indirect heat exchange with water. both of these methods of gas cooling result in large in creases in entropy and reduced thermal efficiency. some energy may be recovered, when indirect heat exchange is employed, by passing the heated heat exchange fluid, through an expansion turbine (see british patent applications no. 20806/78 and 20810/76). u.s. patent no. 3,868,817, discloses the generation of power by burning purified fuel gas in the combustor of a gas turbine. according to u.s. patent no. 2,660,521, carbon dioxide or steam may be introduced into the combustor of a turbine or into the efflux from the combustor. such additions may change the composition of the product gas and increase the cost of purifying the process gas stream. in accordance with the present invention, the problems of increase in entropy and reduced thermal efficiency, as well as those of changed composition of the process gas, are avoided by cooling the raw process gas by mixing it with liquid water or recycled purified gas, and producing additional cooling by passing the resulting mixture through an expansion turbine. according to the process of the present invention, the effluent gas stream from a free-flow partial oxidation gas generator at a temperature in the range of 980 to 16500c (1800 to 30000f) and a pressure in the range of 9.8 to 294 bars (10 to 300 atmospheres) and comprising h2, co, co2, h20 and at least one member of the group h2s, cos, ch4, n2, ar, and entrained particulate solids, may be passed through a solids separation zone and then mixed with a recycle portion of a turbine exhaust stream, after said gas stream is cooled, cleaned, optionally water-gas shifted or purified or both, and recompressed. alternatively, the recycle gas stream may be mixed with water, steam, or both. in one embodiment the temperature moderating stream comprises condensate produced in the process. the remaining portion of the process gas stream, which is not recycled, is removed for use as synthesis gas or fuel gas and constitutes the product of the process. the volume ratio of said recycle gas stream to turbine feed gas mixture may be in the range of about 0.2 to 0.8. the amounts and temperatures of the recycle process gas stream, steam, water, and the effluent generator gas stream which may be mixed together are such that the temperature of the resulting turbine feed gas mixture is a value in the range of 537 to 13150c (1000 to 24000f) e.g.
