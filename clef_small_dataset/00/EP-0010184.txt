<ABSTRACT>
the present invention obviates the need for software  support in switching control of a computer between programs  by providing a hardware function on the control unit together  with appropriate control lines to respond to detection of the  need for a program switch, the function including transfer  initiation means (604) which interacts with a function control  means (608) of a function control array (612) to identify an  entry point in the invoked program (610) and conditionally  continuing the transfer mechanism.  the function control  means addresses call return elements (cre's) when it is in an  execute mode but transfers processor control back to the  invoking program when it is in a by-pass mode.  cre's that are  in an available, data-receivable state are chained on an available  call return queue (acq) and may be removed therefrom  and placed on a task dispatching element (tde) on an asneeded  basis through a receive message mechanism.  active  cre's contain a status save means (614) for storing the state of  the invoking program during execution of the invoked program.   in the event there are no active cre's available for such  storage, a task switch occurs, and the current tde, i. e. , the  invoking program, is inserted on a wait list of the acq where it  remains until a cre becomes available.  when the cre  becomes available, the invoking program tde is removed  from the acq wait list and inserted in priority sequence on the  task dispatching queue (tdq).  once a cre is made available  to the tde, the transfer initiation means is restarted.  at the  termination of the execution of the invoked program, a transfer  return means (616) transfers processor control back to the  invoking program and inserts the cre onto the acq.  the  invoking program (600) then commences execution at the  next sequential instruction.
