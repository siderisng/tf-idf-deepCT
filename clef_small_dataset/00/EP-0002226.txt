<ABSTRACT>
an electrode for implantation into cochlea.  the purpose  is to establish electrical communication to the acoustic  nerves of the human ear, substantially in the area of cochlea  containing the acoustic nerves pertaining to that part of the  audible spectrum, which is relevant to the intelligibility of  speech.  the rpblem is that the electrode has to be inserted  into about two turns of cochlea, which implies a risk of  damaging het interior walls of cochlea and possibly the  acoustic nerves too because the tip of the electrode will act  like a chisel.  an improved electrode is designed as a fork  having two prongs (5, 6) and an shank (8), each prong having  a length, which corresponds essentially to the length of the  turn in cochlea, into which it is to be inserted.  further, each  prong terminates in a bevelled guiding surface (16).  the  prongs of shorter length than prior art electrodes, which are  to be inserted through individual openings to cochlea, now  have to pass through only a single turn of cochlea and are  during this insertion prevented from cutting into the walls of  cochlea due to the presence of the bevelled guiding surface.   the guiding surface (16) is made up of an attached,  drop-shaped pilot member or by bending the outermost end  of a support member to form an eyelet.  the two prongs have  uneven lengths due to different lengths of the turns of  cochlea.
