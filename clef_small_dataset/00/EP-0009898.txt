<DESCRIPTION>
anti-hypertensive agents, a process for their preparation, and their use. background or the 'invention; angiotensin converting enzyme (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, hereinafter referred to as ace) occupies a central role in the physiology of hypertension. the enzyme is capable of convertingthe decapeptide anqiotensin i, havina the sequence aspargvaltyrilehisprophehisteu to an octapeptide, angiotensinii by removal of the carboxyterminal hisleu. the symbols for various chemical entities are explained in the following table: ala 5 l-alanine arg = l-arginine asp = l-aspartic acid ( glu = pyro-l-glutamic acid gly = glycine hip = hippuric acid (benzoyl-glycine) his = l-histidine lie = t-isoleucine leu = l-leucine phe = l-phenylalanine pro = l-proline apro - t-3,4-dehydroproline ser = l-serine trp = l-tryptophan tyr = l-tyrosine val = l-valine ace = angiotensin converting enzyme heps = n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2 ethanesulfonic acid angiotensin i is formed by the action of the enzyme renin, an endopeptidase found in kidney, other tissues and plasma, acting on a serum sl-2 globulin. blood pressure is affected by certain peptides found in the blood. one of these, angiotensin ii, is a powerful pressor (blood pressure elevating) agent. another, bradykinin, a nonapeptide with the sequence argproproglypheser prophearg is a powerful depressor (blood pressure lowering) agent. in addition to a direct pressor. effect, angiotensin ii stimulates release of aldosterone which tends to elevate blood pressure by causing retention of extracellular salt and fluids. angiotensin ii is found in measurable amount in the blood of normal humans. however, it is found at elevated concentrations in the blood of patients with renal hypertension. the level of ace activity is ordinarily in excess, in both normal and hypertensive humans, of the amount needed to maintain observed levels of antiogensin ii. however, it has been found that significant blood pressure lowering is achieved in hypertensive patients by treatment with ace inhibitors. egavras, i., et al., new engl. 3. med. 291. 817. (1974)3. detailed description of the invention the present invention relates to novel inhibitors of ace which have the general formula emi2.1 wherein r is hydrogen, formal, acetyl, propanoyl, butanoyl, phenylacetyl, phenylpropanoyl, benzoyl, cyclopentylcarbonyl, tert-butyloxycarbonyl, cyclopentylcarbonyl-l-lysyl, pyro-l glutamyl-l-lysyl, l-lysyl, l-arginyl or pyro-la-glutamyl; a is l-phenylalanyl, glycyl, l-alanyl, l-tryptophyl, l-tyrosyl, l-isoleucyl, l-leucyl, l-histidyl or l-valyl, the amino group thereof being in amide linkage with r; r1 is hydrogen or methyl; ; r2 is in-proline, l-3, 4-dehydroproline, d,l-3,4 dahydroproline, l-3-hydroxyproline, l-4-hydroxyproline or lthiazolidine. the imino group thereof being in imide linkage with the adjacent emi2.2 and, n is 0 or 1, such that&gamma; when n=0, r1 is methyl. all amino acids discussed herein are in the l-configuration unless otherwise noted. the disclosed compounds are inhibitors of ace and are useful as orally effective antihypertensive agents. the discovery of ace inhibitory potency in the compounds of the present invention provides a unique approach to the desinn of inhibitory compounds. although many prior art inhibitors are proline derivatives, substitution of other amino acids for proline has also yielded potent inhibitors. arginine, phenyl-alanine and alanine are all effective substitutes for proline, so that a trend is not
