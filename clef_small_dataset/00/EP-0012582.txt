<ABSTRACT>
a multi-stage hydraulic ram is provided with telescopic  ram tubes (10-15) which are terminated by end assemblies  (22 and 23) which provide a working surface (26) for the re­ spective ram tube and a sliding bearing for a next adjacent  ram tube.  each of the end assemblies is so mounted on its  associated tube and so dimensioned that removal of it from  the tube and the ram in an axial direction can be carried out  without obstruction from the end assembly of the next adja­ cent ram of smaller diameter.
