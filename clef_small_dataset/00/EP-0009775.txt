<ABSTRACT>
an improved, blocked, change gear transmission utilizing  at least one improved resilient jaw clutch assembly (42,  72; 142, 172) to selectively engage a selected gear to a shaft  is provided.  the improved jaw clutch assembly (42, 72) and a  blocker mechanism (81) to prevent engagement of the jaw  clutch members (42, 72; 142, 172) until the jaw clutch members  (42, 72; 142, 172) are rotating at a substantially synchronous  speed.  preferably, one of the jaw clutch members  (42; 142) carries axially and radially outwardly extending  external clutch teeth (49, 51) designed for selective interengagement  with axially and radially inwardly extending internal  jaw clutch teeth (50) carried by the other jaw clutch  member (72; 172).  the improvement comprises providing a  back-lash (208) between the interengageable clutch teeth (50,  51) which is substantially greater than the back-lash (208)  normally utilized with similar clutch assemblies, said  increased back-lash (208) being in the range of five to fifteen  times greater than normal back-lash (208) and preferably  about ten times greater than normal back-lash (208).

<DESCRIPTION>
blocked change gear transmission utilizing resilient shifting eiechanisms and improved jaw clutch assembly therefor background of the invention field of the invention this invention relates to shiftable, blocked, change speed gear devices, preferably multiple countershaft floating main shaft transmissions having resiliently yieldable shifting means utilizing blocker and jaw clutch assemblies for substantially simplifying shifting of the transmission, and in particular relates to shiftable, blocked, change gear transmissions utilizing improved axially engageable jaw clutch assemblies effective to allow more positive axial engagement of the interengageable clutch teeth of the jaw clutch members as the jaw clutch members pass through, or cross, synchronous. background of the invention in the design of transmissions, particulary heavy duty transmissions, such as for example are#-used in trucks, there has existed for a long time the problem of shifting the transmission to the various gear ratios, which problem is even greater when the transmission is provided with an auxiliary transmission 'section of the range or the splitter type for Â¯ifld#a'asing..the;number of gear ratios. in'most known transmissions, the shifting process is either- relatively difficult and/or the shifting mechanism is relatively complex. thus, there has been acontinuing effort in. the design of transmissions to improve the shifting, to improve the rapidity of shifting, to reduce the -complexity 'of the shifting mechanism, and to reduce its' costs. hence, without detracting in any way from the operability or desirability of many of the shifting mechanisms previously :knownj it may be stated that in the present invention these general objectives are accomplished to even a greater degree than has been previously considered possible. 'particulary, -most previously known transmissions have requ.ir,e-d a, .#relatively high level of operator skill or necessarily utilized synchronizers, of which many different types are known, for causing the speed of the jaw or tooth clutch members to be substantially synchronized prior to permitting their interengagement during a shifting sequence from one speed ratio to another speed ratio. while the use of synchronizers does permit the shifting operation to be performed more easily, their use, as is already known, imposes certain requirements of weight, space and power which it would be desirable to ease, or avoid entirely. these and other problems incident to previously known transmissions were set forth and acknowledged in united states patents nos. 3,799,002, entitled "transmission with resiliently loaded main shaft gears"; 3,910,131, entitled "trans mission with snap shift"; 3,921,469, entitled "transmission with resiliently loaded main shaft gears; 3,924,484, entitled "sensor un blocking ramps"; and 3,983,979, entitled "sensor unblocking ramps"; all hereby incorporated by reference and assigned to the same assignee as the present application. apparatus is disclosed in the above mentioned patents which effectively meets the problems while providing a reliable, effective and efficient transmission, particularly for heavy duty use. while both forms of the inventions disclosed in said patents, namely, those using blockers and those not using blockers, are effective for carrying out the objectives thereof, it has been noted that for usual reasons both noise and clutch tooth wear can be minimized by the
