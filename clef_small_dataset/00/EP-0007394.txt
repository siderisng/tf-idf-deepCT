<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical writer (19), which has a compressed air-controllable write medium reservoir (10) on, from which a downstream write device (13) is the liquid write means (14) to be supplied, is with one between the compressed air source (1) and the writing Tel reservoir (10) switched on, as a function of the operating state of the writing device (13) controllable VEN (7) provided, as well as a traceably arranged between the write medium (10) and the writing device (13), in dependence on the write medium pressure automatically regulating outlet valve (16 ). By the controllable valve (7) closed in the operating position of the writing device (13) and closed in their resting stelion, a controlled pressure and degradation in the write medium reservoir (10) takes place, whereby the exhaust valve (16) in the write position automatically open and thereby the write means (14) The writing device (13) is supplied, whereas it closes automatically in the pressure reduction associated with the rest position of the writing device (13) and thus blocks the write cash inflow.
