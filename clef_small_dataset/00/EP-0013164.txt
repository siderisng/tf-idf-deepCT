<ABSTRACT>
a wire stitcher includes a cutter 125 for cutting a length of  wire w from a supply thereof and a stitcher head 101, having a  former 105 and driver 106, for forming and driving the length  of cut wire for binding a set ss of sheets.  the length of cut wire  which is presented to the head 101 by wire advancing and  cutting mechanism 103 is automatically determined in  a dependence upon the thickness of the set ss.  the mechanism  103 includes a movable gripper block 120 which advances the  wire and the cutter 125 is carried on a movable cutter block  121.  movement of the blocks 120 and 121 is limited such as by  an inhibitor 124 which is positioned in dependence upon set  thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
wire stitchers and methods of binding sets of sheets this invention relates to wire stitchers, )cirticlarly for binding sets or signatures ol siieets or documents, and to methods of binding sets of sheets. stichers take various well-known forms. there are those (called staplers) which use pre-formed staples, those using pre-cut lengths of wire which are formed in the machine and those in which the staples are formed from a continuous wire wound on a spool from which pieces are cut and formed in the machine. in each case the legs of the formed staple or stitch are driven through the set until the crown of the staple lies against one face of the set and the ends of the staple legs are bent over against the opposite face of the set to form clinches. the present invention is concerned with wire stitches including a cutter for cutting a length of wire from a supply thereof and a stitcher head for forming ad driving the length of cut wire for binding a set of sheets. it will be understood that where the stitcher is capable of accommodating sets of varying thickness it is desirable to have some means of adjusting the length of wire used for forming the stitch and although it is possible to accommodate varying set thicknesses by permitting the clinches to vary according to the thickness of the set, even to the extent in some cases of angling the clinches so that they overlap for very thin sets, this imposes limits on the capacity of the machine and is also aesthetically undesirable. in order to avoid this, machines are available in which the length of wire cut to form the stitch may be varied, but in order to achieve such variation it has been necessary to stop the machine in order to perform an accurate and usually. intricate manual adjustment requiring a skilled operator. such procedure is acceptable where long runs of identical sets or signatures are being produced such as occurs in the printing industry (e.g. saddle stitching magazines) but does not provide a solution in the case where frequent and soften substantial variations in set thickness occur such as in a finisher receiving sets from an office copier or duplicator. the invention is characterised in that the length of the piece of wire is determined automatically in dependence on the thickness of said set of sheets. in one embodiment, the cutter is movable and the length of cut wire presented to the stitching head is auto mat calls determined by advancing the wire by a distance dependent upon the thickness of the set and positioning the cutter in dependence upon the thickness of the set. preferably, the wire is advanced past a normal or rest position of the cutter by a distance made up of a constant (crown length plus twice clinch length) plus the set thickness and the cutter is retracted from the rest position by a distance equal to the set thickness. however, given
