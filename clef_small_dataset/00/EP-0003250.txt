<ABSTRACT>
a multicolour electroluminescent display device uses a  layer (22) of material, e. g.  zns:mn, of which the brightness/Â­ voltage characteristic exhibits hysteresis, and a second layer  (18) of material, e. g.  zns:cu,al, without hysteresis and with a  different emission spectrum.  an alternating voltage is applied  across the layers and, initially, is divided such that the  voltage across each layer is insufficient to excite either layer  into emission.  a voltage pulse is momentarily applied so as  to excite the layer 22 into emission.  after removal of the  voltage pulse, the operating point of the layer 22 is such that  the alternating voltage divides so as to excite, as required,  either or both layers.  in accordance with the value of the  voltage pulse, any colour mixture of the colours emitted by  the two layers can be displayed.  the voltage pulse can be  supplied by an x-y arrangement of electrodes (14, 26) or by  an electron or light beam.  the invention can be extended to  three or more layers of electroluminescent material.
