<ABSTRACT>
an ammonia production process comprising synthesis  gas generation and ammonia synthesis with heat recovery in  the generation section by steam raising and steam superheating  and heat recovery in the synthesis section by steam  raising or boiler feed water heating is made more controllable  by effecting part of the superheating in the synthesis section,  so that a shut-down of the synthesis section results not only in  a decrease in steam flow through the superheaters, but also in  a decrease in the temperature of the steam fed to them.  thus  overheating of the superheaters, a defect of some earlier  processes, is avoided.  referring to figure 1, the steam system that characterizes  the process according to the invention is based, in this preferred  flowsheet, on common steam drum 100.  drum 100 is fed  with treated boiler water heated in exchanger 82 by reacted  ammonia synthesis.  water circulates from drum 100 through boilers 30, 36  and 40.  steam passing overhead from drum 100 is superheated  in heat exchanger 80 by reacted ammonia synthesis gas  at 32 and let down in high pressure pass-out turbine 104  driving process air compressor 108, which supplies hot air as  a result of limited inter-stage cooling and feeds secondary  reformer 28 at point 112 by way of preheater 110.  the process is operated with a synthesis pressure under  150, preferably 40-80 bar abs.  and preferably synthesis gas  generation is based on primary hydrocarbon steam reforming  at such a pressure that synthesis gas compression is by under  50%.
