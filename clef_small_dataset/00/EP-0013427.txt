<ABSTRACT>
The spherical fiber unit is present as a ball yarn (36) from individual fibers (37), which are incapacilately involved with a length of at least 15 mm in a needle-capable density sph√§rish.They are spherically looped with their ends (38) by other fibers (37) spherically, whereby they are held in the fiber association.The structure of the loosely engaged fibers (37) are individually detectable and can therefore in a z.b.By needling the ball yarn (36) solidified fiber layer of a textile surface image, which then z.b.a structured surface or visually original structure.
