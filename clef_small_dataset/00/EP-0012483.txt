<ABSTRACT>
laundry detergent compositions, which are either free  of phosphate materials or contain only low levels of such  materials, containing a nonionic surfactant, preferably  specific alcohol ehtoxylate nonionic surfactants, together  with selected single long chain (c₂₀-c₃₀) alkyl cationic  surfactants, are disclosed.  these compositions provide  both excellent particulate and greasy/oily soil removal and,  additionally, provide fabric softening, static control, color  fidelity, and dye transfer inhibition benefits to fabrics laun­ dered therewith.  a process for laundering,fabrics, using  these compositions, is also disclosed.
