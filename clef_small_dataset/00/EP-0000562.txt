<ABSTRACT>
Two-layered flooring in sandwich construction, especially for sports purposes, and a process for its production.The known plastic coverings have an elasticity without a damping effect, which has proven mass-damaging effects on the human moving apparatus.To avoid this harmful effect, a closed-cell, crosslinked polyethylene foam (3) having a maximum space weight of 35 kg / m³ (4) comprising air-filled cavities, with a synthetic polypropylene fibers (1) serving as a stride surface, which requires needling(2) has at least two million injections per m².The nonwoven is connected to the polyethylene foam with the aid of the flame welding method without adhesive layer or any other intermediate layer having the polyethylene foam, which may be perforated for water permeability (5).
