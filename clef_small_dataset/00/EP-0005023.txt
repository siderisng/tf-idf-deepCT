<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for machining the face of a tubesheet disposed  in a steam generator shell from which the tubes have  been removed, said apparatus being mounted on primary  support means welded to the inner wall of said steam  generator shell, and secondary support means removably  attached to said primary support means, said primary and  secondary support means (64, 70) consisting of a large  diameter anti-friction bearing (60) having a non-rotatable  outer bearing race (62) mounted on a support ring (63) and a  rotatable inner bearing race (61) carrying a circular turntable  (42) removably attached to the rotatable inner bearing race  (61), and having a machining tool assembly (41) disposed on  a face thereof adjacent to the tubesheet (40) for machining  the corresponding face thereof during rotary movement of  said turntable (42).  with this arrangement remote machining of the surface  of the tubesheet is facilitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
steam generator tube sheet face machining apparatus this invention relates to apparatus for effecting retubing of a steam generator in a nuclear power plant. nuclear reactor power plants utilize a steam generator having a tube bundle to transfer heat from a primary side reactor-heated-liquid to water on a secondary side to form steam for driving a turbine. condenser leaks in the power plants have caused circulating water, which is often brackish, to mix with the secondary-side water in the steam generator, resulting in the build-up of undesirable chemicals in the tube bundle. water treatment and blowdown have not completely protected the steam generator tubes from corrosion and leaks. as the number of tubes subject to such leaks increases, the desirability of replacement or repair of the steam generator increases. since removal of a steam generator intact from a nuclear power plant requires removal of a large portion of a reinforced concrete containment vessel, replacement of such generator in such manner becomes time consuming, expensive, and therefore undesirable. in on-site retubing of a nuclear plant steam generator, it has been proposed, for example, to remove a top portion of the steam generator shell to gain access to the tube bundle for removing same. following removal of the tube bundle tubes for replacement, the faces of the tubesheet must be reconditioned and this must be done remotely, since the area within the steam generator shell is radioactive. it is therefore the principal object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which can perform such operation by automatic or remote control. with this object in view, the present invention resides in apparatus for machining the face of a tubesheet disposed in a steam generator shell from which the tubes have been removed, said apparatus being mounted on primary support means welded to the inner wall of said steam generator shell, and secondary support means removably attached to said primary support means, characterized in that said primary and secondary support means consists of a large diameter anti-friction bearing having a nonrotatable outer bearing race mounted on a support ring with adjustable centering means and a rotatable inner bearing race carrying a circular turntable which is parallel to the tubesheet face and removably attached at its outer periphery to said rotatable inner bearing race, said turntable having a machining tool assembly disposed on a face thereof adjacent to said tubesheet for machining the corresponding face thereof during rotary movement of said turntable, said machining tool having a head which is radially movable on said turntable, said turntable having power operated drive means for turning said turntable during operation of said machining tool assembly the invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings, in which: : figure 1 is a vertical perspective view of the tube-containing portion of a nuclear power plant steam generator shown partially in section; figure 2 is a vertical view partly in outline and
