<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula (i):    wherein:   y is -ch₂ch₂-, -ch=ch- or -c=c-   n is 1 to 5;   r₁ is hydrogen, or co₂ r₁ represents an ester group in which  the r₁ moiety contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms;   r₂ is hydrogen, c₁₋₄ alkyl, trifluoromethyl, or phenyl;   r₃ is hydroxy or protected hydroxy;   r₅ is hydrogen, c₁₋₆ alkyl, phenyl or phenyl c₁₋₆ alkyl, any of  which phenyl moieties may be substituted by one or more  halogen, trifluoromethyl, c₁₋₆ alkyl, c₁₋₆ alkoxy or nitro  groups; and   x is ch₂ and   r₄ is c₁₋₉ alkyl, c₃₋₈ cycloalkyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl, phenyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl or  naphthyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl, any of which groups may have one  acyclic carbon-carbon bond interrupted by an oxygen atom;  hydrogen, c₃₋₈ cycloalkyl, phenyl or naphthyl, any of which  phenyl of naphthyl moieties in r₄ may be substituted by one  or more halogen, trifluoromethyl, c₁₋₆ alkyl, hydroxy, c₁₋₆  alkoxy or nitro groups; or r₂ and r₄ taken with the carbon  atom to which they are joined represent a c₅₋₈ cycloalkyl  group; or   x is cs and   r₄ is c₁₋₉ alkyl, c₃₋₈ cycloalkyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl, phenyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl or  naphthyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl, having one acyclic carbon-carbon bond  interrupted by an oxygen atom, and in which any phenyl or  naphthyl moieties may be substituted by one or more  halogen, trifluoromethyl, c₁₋₆ alkyl, hydroxy, c₁₋₆ alkoxy or  nitro groups; and salts thereof; having similar pharmacological  activity to natural prostaglandins, processes for their  preparation, intermediates useful in those processes and  pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the  formula (i).
