<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2- (2,2-dimethyl-3-butene-1-yl) -2-oxazolines, which is characterized in that one is 2-methylene-3- (3-methyl-2 -Butenyl) - Oxazolidine optionally heated in the presence of a diluent. The 2-methylene-3- (3-methyl-2-butenyl) -oxazolidines used as intermediates are new, they are redirected by having oxazolidines of the general formula in which R¹ to R⁵ have the meaning given in the description in the liquid or gas phase in the presence or absence of an inert diluent pyrolized. The oxazolidines of the general formula (III) are new. They are obtained by reacting 2-methyl-3- (3-methyl -2-butenyl) -2 oxazolinium salts with alcoholates. The 2-methyl-3- (3-methyl-2-butenyl) - 2-oxazolinium salts are new. They are obtained by reacting 2-methyloxazoline of the general formula (VI) in which R¹-R⁴ the meaning given in the description is reacted with 3-methyl-3-butene-1-yl derivatives.
