<ABSTRACT>
in a hot roll fuser for a xerographic copier, the hot roll 14  is mounted at a fixed axial position and the back-up roll 16 is  mounted on pivot arms 36 for pivotal movement about axis 38  to and from the hot roll.  a further pivot arm assembly is  mounted on an axis 42 positioned between the axes of the  rolls.  this assembly includes two arms 40, each of which  extends round the axis 34 of the back-up roll to a mounting  position 60.  at each end of the back-up roll, a compression  spring 50 is mounted between the roll axis 34 and mounting  position 60.  arms 40 each include a cam follower surface 44  which engages the surface of a cam 46.  as cam 46 rotates it  causes movement of the arms between a position at which  back-up roll 16 is separated from roll 14 and a position at  which roll 16 is urged into contact with roll 14 by springs 50.  at  this latter position, the axis 34 of the back-up roll is positioned  on a line between pivotal axis 42 and mounting position 60.
