<ABSTRACT>
A lateral transistor is equipped with a vertically aligned, by the p-doped collector zone 44 to the underlying N-doped epitaxial layer 4 and a buried n-doped zone 6, the sub-base zone extending N-doped base zone 36. The sub-coated zone 6 serves to the low-impedance electrical connection of the base zone 36, wherein the epitaxial layer 4 is to be viewed as an extrinsic base zone over which the connection of the active intrinsic base zone to the surface takes place. Using the mask windows already used for introducing the base zone 36, the implantation of the emitter zone 62 takes place in the base zone. This double-diffused base-emitter structure enables compliance with an accurate base width of the intrinsic base zone of the lateral transistor defined by the side surfaces of the base and emitter zone. The optimal properties having lateral PNP transistor can be integrated simultaneously without incorporating additional process steps with a vertical NPN transistor in the gleic semiconductor body.
