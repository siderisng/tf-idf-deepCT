<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotor for a rotor blade aircraft with a straight number of rotor blades (1), which are arranged on the rotor head (3) pairing each other diametrically opposite each rotor blade pair via a common, from which one to the other leaf root in-piece college part (2) are arranged. which is torsional side as well as with regard to the leaf angle movements torsional soft as well as with regard to the blade slot and leaf swing movements. In order to exclude a mutual influence of blade angle adjustment movements and blade slot / sheet joint movements, according to the invention, according to the invention, the holm part (2) on the one hand in the rotor head (3) is immovably clamped and on the other hand on the other side of the rotor head with a range (2. 2) of higher torsional deviation than the Other spars and with one of the sheet wing (1. 1) from this area (2nd 2.) bridging, bending strip carrier (6) provided. This carrier is, leaf blade side with the holm part (2) at a rotor head connection (radial elastomer bearing 7), rotor head side with the holm part (2) at such a location rigidly connected (plastic layers 6. 1), that up to the clamping of the holm part (2) in the rotor head (3) Still remains a bending soft area (2. 1) of the holm part for the blade slot and leaf swing movements.
