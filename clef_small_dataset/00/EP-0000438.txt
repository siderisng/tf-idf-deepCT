<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacture of a tubular metal  container or vessel, such as a shell or cartridge case, in  which an open-ended hollow metal tube (10) is mounted  on a mandrel (12), and in which the mandrel (12) and a  forming punch (17) are moved relative to one another in a  die (21) such that the metal at one end of the tube (10) is  displaced inwardly from around the circumference of the  tube to form a central hole at the said end of the tube, the  displaced metal being formed with an external recess or  pocket communicating with the said hole.
