<ABSTRACT>
a sheet which is a composite of (a) from about 1 percent  to about 30 percent of a water-dispersible fiber such  as wood fiber, (b) from about 2 percent to about 30 percent  of a film-forming, water-insoluble organic polymer  such as a copolymer of styrene and butadiene, and (c)  from about 60 percent to about 95 percent of a finely-divided,  substantially water-insoluble, non-fibrous, inorganic  filler such as magnesium hydroxide is prepared by  steps comprising:   (i) providing an aqueous dispersion of the fiber;   (ii) mixing therewith (a) the inorganic filler and (b)  the organic polymer in the form of an ionically stabilized  latex;   (iii) colloidally destabilizing the resulting mixture to  form a fibrous agglomerate in aqueous suspension;   (iv) distributing and draining the aqueous dispersion  on a porous substrate such as a wire to form a wet web;  and   (v) drying the web.
