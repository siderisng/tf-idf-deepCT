<ABSTRACT>
a reversible plough has a double acting hydraulic ram  (6) connected between the headstock and the reversing  spindle (4) to reverse the plough frame from a left handed  to a right handed ploughing position, and vice versa.  hy­ draulically operating mechanism is provided in the head­ stock both to switch the flow of hydraulic fluid from one to  the other end of the double acting ram (6) and to apply ad­ ditional reversing torque to the spindle (4) at the midway  position.  the mechanism comprises two hydraulic cylinders  (9, 10) acting upon a fork (12) pivotally mounted in the  headstock and engaging with a roller (26) spaced radially  of the spindle (4).  as the midway position is approached,  the roller (26) displaces the fork (12) from a rest position  whereupon the fork is rotated by the cylinders (9, 10) to  drive the reversing spindle (4) through the midway position.   internal fluid pathways in the two cylinders (9, 10) effect  the change of fluid flow to the double acting ram (6).
