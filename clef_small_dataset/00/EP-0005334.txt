<DESCRIPTION>
electrophotographic toner composition this invention relates to an electrophotographic toner composition which comprises a colorant and a resin. the electrophotographic process and more specifically the xerographic process is fully described in u. s. patent 3,635,704. in summary, in the xerographic process a plate generally comprising a conductive backing upon which is placed a photoconductive insulating surface is uniformly charged and subsequently the photoconductive surface is exposed to a light image of the original to be reproduced. the photoconductive surface is prepared in such a manner so as to cause it to become conductive under the influence of the light image in order that the electrostatic charge contained thereon can be selectively dissipated to produce a latent image which is developed by means of a variety of pigmented resin materials especially made for this purpose such as toner. it is this toner material that is electrostatically attracted to the latent image areas on the plate in proportion to the charge concentration thereof, thus in areas of high charge concentration high attraction of toner results while in areas of low charge concentration substantially no toner is attracted. this developed image can then be transferred to a final support material such as paper and affixed thereto. there are many methods that are known for developing and fixing the resulting images, some of which are disclosed in u. s. patent no. 3,635,704 and include for example, cascade development as described in u. s. patent no. 2,6181552; magnetic brush development as described in u. s. patents 2,874,063; 3,251,706; and 3,357,402; powder cloud development as described in u.s. patent no. 2,221,776; and touchdown development as described in u. s. patent no. 3,166,432. the fixing can be either vapor fixing, heat fixing, pressure fixing or combinations thereof as described in u.s. patent no. 3,539,161. modern electrostatographic reproducing apparatuses which are capable of producing copies at extremely high rates can employ radiant flash fusing as this seems to be the best method for affixing images in such en vironments. the energy which is emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves is instantly available and requires no intervening medium for its propogation. -the type of toner material. that is used in a development system is very important as not only is the image quality a consideration, but cleaning and damage to machine components is a factor that must be contended with. after forming a powder image on the electrostatic latent image during the development step as explained herein, the powder image can be electrically transferred to the support surface by means of a corona generating device as described for example in u.s. patent no. 2,777,957. specifically, transfer is effected by such a device by imparting an electrostatic charge to attract the powder image from the drum to the support surface. the polarity of the charge required to affect the transfer of the image depends upon the visual form of the original copy relative to the reproduction as well as the electroscopic characteristics of the developing material employed to accomplish
