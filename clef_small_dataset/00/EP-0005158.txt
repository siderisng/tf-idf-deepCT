<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous coating means for the order are produced by a chemical precipitation process on metal. The products are emulsions based on adducted α, β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids on homo and / or copolymers of alkali rails, for example butadiene or pentadiene, with an acidity of the adduct corresponding to 12.5-25 wt. % Maleic anhydride. The anhydride structures may optionally be opened by hydrolysis or half-building. The emulsification in water takes place in the presence of anionic, optionally nonionic emulsifiers. The organic solvent used in the preparation of the resin is simultaneously or completely removed. The products can be emulsified with additional curing components or other resins. To trigger the coagulation in the application method, corresponding reagents, such as hydrofluoric acid or iron (III) salts are used. The emulsions are also suitable for the production of coating agents, also air-drying suitable for conventional order types. The emulsions produce overcoats with excellent properties in each case.
