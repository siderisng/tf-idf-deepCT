<ABSTRACT>
Factory for the manufacture of concrete products, reinforced concrete and / or prestressed concrete, comprising a horizontal rotational rotation drum with an outdoor cylindrical surface, molding means and to pass, during rotation, said molding means in front of various workstations, including concrete, hardened, demolding and implementation positions. The drum T is equipped with beams (9) with a fixed compound, in particular by welding, longitudinally on the outer periphery of the drum, said beams: having a cross section which has zones to form a working path parallel to the axis. longitudinal drum for rolling and guidance of compacting means (29) of concrete; being equipped with means for attaching the molds in a position radially outwardly located with respect to the susceptible working path, having sufficient mechanical strength to absorb most of the prestressing efforts carried on the reinforcements in the case. From the manufacture of prestressed concrete elements.
