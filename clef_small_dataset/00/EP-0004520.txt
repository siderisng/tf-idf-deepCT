<ABSTRACT>
transmission of data signals using an optical array keyboard.  light sources 1 and collimators 2 sequentially direct a light beam 8 along the rows of an array of beam-splitting elements, 3, controlled by keys 4.  when an element 3 is placed in the path of a beam 8 it reflects part of it towards one of the detectors 7 placed in the columns of the array, but allows the other part to pass towards the other elements 3 situated downstream, thus permitting detection of the state of the other keys of the same row, and resolution of the problem relating to the situation where a key is depressed before the previous one is released.  the keyboard can be used as a unit for inputing data into a data processing system.  <image>
