<ABSTRACT>
combined washing and bleaching of fabrics is accomplished by use of a composition comprising a surfactant and a photoactivator.  the photoactivator is a porphine or a mono-, di-, tri-, or tetraaza porphine, solubilized with anionic, nonionic and/or cationic substituent groups, and metal free or metallated with zn(ii), ca(ii), cd(ii), mg(ii), sc(iii), al(iii) or sn(iv).

<DESCRIPTION>
composition containing a photo activator for improved washing and blfaching of fabrics this invention relates to household laundry compositions for combined washing and bleaching of fabrics, and to processes for simultaneous removal of stains and fugitive dyes. united states patent 3,927,967 relates to a washing and bleaching process utilizing photoactivat ng compounds, principally sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine, in the presence of visible light and atmospheric oxygen. japanese patent application opi 50-113,479 teaches te use of specific mixtures of sulfonated zinc phthalocyanines as preferred bleach photoactivators. in each of the foregoing references the detergent compositions utilizing sulfonated zinc phtha- locyanine contained botn organic surfactant and alkaline builder salt. belgian patent no. 840,348 discloses the use of zinc phthalocyanine tri- and tetra-sulfonates as bleach photoactivators in unbuilt liquid detergent compositions. u.s. patents 2,951,77; 2,951,798; 2,951,799 and 2,951,800, assigned to monsanto chemical company and issued on september 6, 1960 describe certain porphines as catalysts for the phto-oxidation of olefins. references to carboxylated porphines have appeared in u.s. patent 2,706,199, issued april 12, 1955, invented by brentano et al., and c.r. acad.sci., ser. c 1972, 275(11), 573-6 authored by gaspard et al. see also color index no. 74320. references to aminosulfonyl porphines are west german ols 2,057,194 laid open june 8, 1972, invented by von der eltz et al.; british patent 613,781 accepted december 2, 1948, invented by mayhew; and british patent 876,691 published september 6, 1961, issued to geigy a.g. see also color index no. 74350. other substituted porphines are disclosed in austrian patent 267,711issued january 10, 1969, invented by swimmer; french patent 1,266,094 published may 29, 1961, invented by tartter et al.; u.s. patent 2,670,265 issued february 23, 1954, invented by heyna et al.; british patent 471,418 accepted august 30, 1937, invented by groves; and jcs 1938, 1-6 authored by dent. it has now been found that certain species of photoactivators other than sulfonated phthalocyanices perform a similar fabric bleaching function in the presence of visible light and atmospheric oxygen. these other photoactivators provide in fact not only stain removal but also improved whitening of the fabrics in two other respects: the first of these is an improvement in the general whiteness of the fabrics, which is often referred to as whiteness maintenance; this improvement is not however accomplished in the ordinary way by reducing the reprecipitation of dirt upon cleaned fabrics, but rather by oxygen bleaching of the overall fabric discoloration that is often present in soiled fabrics even after washing with ordinary detergent compositions. the second respect in which whiteness can be improved by the compositions of this invention is in the removal of so-called fugitive dyes --the tendency of some colored fabrics to release dye into the laundering solutions, which dye is then transferred during laundering onto other fabrics being washed therewith. dye transfer removal using peroxy acids together with chemical activators is the subject of u.s. patent 3,822,114 and of belgian patent no. 843,160. this invention relates to a detergent bleach ccmposition canprising an anionic, nonionic, semi-polar, ampholytic, or
