<ABSTRACT>
On circumferential tensile members (10) are several at regular intervals driving connector (13) are attached, which have on their leading edge stop surfaces (13a) which attack on the caster edges (1b) of the printed products (1) incurred in a dandruff (S). Between the tension members (10), a suction head (14) is arranged, which communicates via a connecting line (15) with a vacuum source. The suction head (14) holds the passed printed products (1) tightly or delays their forward movement until the detected printed product (1) is taken by a driver (13). By retaining each second printing product (1) it is achieved that each driver (13) supplies two consecutive printed products (1) to the individual grippers (19) of a transporter (17). Since each gripper (19) transports two printed products (1), the transporter (17) can be driven at a lower speed than the feed rate of the dandruff (S), which u. a. a quieter run and a lower wearer of the transporter (17).
