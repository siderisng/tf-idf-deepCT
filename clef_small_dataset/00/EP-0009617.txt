<ABSTRACT>
a superheterodyne receiver employs as a local oscillator  a vco (125) included in a pll (115).  upon depression of a  station selecting switch (200), a pulse is generated and  counted by a trinary counter (311) and two decimal counters  (313, 315).  the count value in the trinary counter is deterÂ­ mined to indicate the channel index.  the count value in the  two decimal counters is subjected to the first addition (320) of  "2" and the sum thereof is indicated as channel number data,  while the same is subjected to multiplication (321) by 3 and  the product thereof is subjected to the second addition (323)  of a numerical value corresponding to the lowest channel  frequency, whereupon the sum thereof is added in the third  addition (327) to the count value in the trinary counter and the  sum thereof is set in the pll, while the same is indicated as the  receiving frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
superheterodyne receiver the present invention relates to a superheterodyne receiver. more specifically, the present invention relates to a superheterodyne receiver employing as a local oscillator a voltage controlled oscillator included in a phase locked loop, adapted to indicate a channel number and a channel index of a receiving channel. recently an electronic tuning apparatus has been employed in place of mechanical tuning apparatus in a superheterodyne receiver. such an electronic tuner usually employs a voltage controlled oscillator as a local oscillator. a phase locked loop including a voltage controlled oscillator has also been developed and such a voltage controlled oscillator has also been employed as a local oscillator of a superheterodyne receiver. a digital frequency display has also been proposed which displays in a digital manner the frequency of a broadcasting station now in reception by the use of the digital data based on the data available in a phase locked loop. typically such a digital frequency indication is made by the use of the numerals of four digits. in spite of the fact that the frequency of a broadcasting station now in reception is displayed with accuracy by a digital frequency display, a problem is encountered by a user that it in often difficult for him to correctly memorize the frequencies of a large number of broadcasting stations. in order to avoid such difficulty, it has been proposed that in a given frequency band, such as an fm band, channel numbers are allotted to the respective broadcasting stations so that a desired broadcasting station can be identified by a corresponding channel number of a decreased number of digits. on the other hand, historically in europe a broadcasting standard was employed in the fm band until before 1962 in which 56 broadcasting frequencies were determined with the interval frequency of 300 khz between two adjacent broadcasting frequencies. however, thereafter the standard was revised to a new one in which 168 fm broadcasting frequencies were determined with the interval frequency of 100 krz between two adjacent broadcasting frequencies. particularly, the broadcasting frequencies allotted after 1962 were additionally allotted such that two additional broadcasting frequencies come in the vicinity of the broadcasting frequency allotted before 1962. therefore, one of the broadcasting frequencies allotted after 1962 is 100 krz lower than the broadcasting frequency allotted before 1962 and the other of the broadcasting frequency allotted after 1962 is 100 khz higher.than the broadcasting frequency allotted before 1962. nevertheless, as far as the channel number indication is concerned, the broadcasting frequencies allotted after 1962 have been identified by the channel numbers asscociated with the channel allotted before 1962, but with an additional channel index. for example, the broadcasting frequency of 93.3. nrz 0 is identified as channel no. 21 or channel no. 21 in the above described channel indication, wherein the notation "o" indicates that the broadcasting frequency of 93.3 mhz is a broadcasting frequency allotted before 1962. on the other hand, the frequency of 93.2 mhz is identified as channel no. 21 ,
