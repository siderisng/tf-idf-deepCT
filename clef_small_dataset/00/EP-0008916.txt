<ABSTRACT>
used rubber is treated for recycling by placing it in a  mixture containing one or more optionally substituted ben­ zenes (e. g.  toluene or xylene) until it is brittle, followed pref­ erably by removal from the mixture and pulverizing it.  the  mixture can contain also one or more c₄ to c₁₀ alkanes or  alkenes and/or optionally substituted pyrrolidones.  prefer­ red inclusive ranges by weight are: optionally substituted  benzenes 40-80% alkanes or alkenes 1-20% and optionally  substituted pyrrolidones 0 - 40%.  a typical composition for  use in the treatment is, by weight, 88% toluene, 6% xylene,  3% methylpyrrolidone and 3% iso-octane.
