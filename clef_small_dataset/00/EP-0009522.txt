<ABSTRACT>
a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon  and/or carbonaceous fuel, comprising at least partially burn足 ing the fuel in a flame provided by a burner, and laterally  confining at least part (e. g.  at least 50%) of the length of the  flame (including the largest cross-sectional dimensions  thereof) in a combustion chamber having cross-sectional  dimensions smaller (curve b) than those of the flame when  not laterally confined (curve a) in the combustion chamber so  as to reduce the cross-sectional dimensions of the confined  part of the flame by an amount of from 1. 00 to 6. 35 cms, but by  less than 20% of the unconfined cross-sectional dimensions.   the lateral confinement of part of the flame by the combus足 tion chamber causes reactive flame species to be reflected  and deflected back into the flame (rather than being lost there足 from or quenched) by the hot walls of the combustion  chamber thereby reducing the amount of carbon and/or  smoke in the gases leaving the combustion chamber (curve a  versus curve b).  further improvement may be obtained by  baffles in the laterally confined part of the flame which prom足 ote flame species recirculation.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon and/or carbonaceous fuel the present invention relates to a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon and/or carbonaceous fuel. in the partial or full combustion of a fuel, it is usual to attempt to (partially) burn the fuel as fully as possible so that the resulting (partially) burned fuel products are as free as possible from carbon-and/or smoke. in addition, it is usual to attempt to (partially) burn the fuel with the smallest possible amount of air (or other combustion-supporting gas). the attainment of one of the foregoing objectives usually results- in a failure to realize the other objective, since carbon or smoke formation tends to increase with a decrease in the amount of air for (part) combustion. in the past, a great deal of effort has been spent in improving the design of burners so that the air requirement for the (part) combustion of fuel to give products of low smoke and/or carbon content has been reduced. it has now been discovered that the amount of carbon and/or smoke generated during the (part) combustion of a fuel can be reduced by ensuring that the (part) combustion of the fuel proceeds in a flame which is at least partially confined by a combustion chamber which is designed to promote recirculation of reactive flame species in the flame rather than allowing such flame species to be quenched. according to the present invention, there is provided a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon and/or carbonaceous fuel, comprising at least partially burning the fuel in a flame supplied by a burner, and laterally confining at least part of the length of the flame having the greatest cross-sectional dimensions, when not confined, in a combustion chamber having cross-sectional dimensions smaller than the cross-sectional dimensions (measured in the same cross-sectional planes) of the said part of the flame so as to reduce the cross-sectional dimensions of the flame by an amount in the range of from 1.00 to 6.35 cms., but by no more than 20% of the unconfined crosssectional dimensions. prefereably, the pressure drop from one. end of the combustion chamber which receives the flame from the burner to the opposite end from which at least partially burned products are discharged is not more than 25.4 cms of water, more preferably less than 12.7 cms of water, still more preferably less than 10.2 cms of water. accordingly, commercially - available burners, which may or may not be modified, may be employed in the method of the invention. the combustion chamber may have the general form of. commercially available combustion chambers, provided that the combustion chamber has cross-sectional dimensions so correlated with the cross-sectional dimensions of the flame that the cross-sectional dimensions of the flame are reduced within the limits specified herein. it is-preferred that the natural or unconfined cross-sectional dimensions.(e.g. diameter) of the flame be reduced by lateral containment or confinement in the combustion chamber by from 1.25 cms or thereabouts to
