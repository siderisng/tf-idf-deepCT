<ABSTRACT>
a traffic barrier comprises a step-like obstruction (1) able  to prohibit flow of vehicles through the barrier in either direction,  a hinged platform (8) disposed adjacent the step-like  obstruction and rockable between a lowered position and a  raised position, in which its trailing edge (11) is adjacent the  top of the step-like obstruction, springs (12) urging the platform  into its raised position, latch means (15) operable to lock  the platform in its raised position, and control means, including  a coin-operated device or the like located in advance of the  leading edge (9) of the platform, for actuating the latch means  and locking the platform in its raised position so as to permit a  vehicle to advance over the step-like obstruction from right to  left.  the control means is responsive to advance of the rear-most  wheels of the vehicle on to the top of the step-like  obstruction to release the latch means and prevent advance of  a following vehicle until the coin-operated device is tripped by  the driver of the following vehicle.
