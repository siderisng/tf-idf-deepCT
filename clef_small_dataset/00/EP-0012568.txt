<ABSTRACT>
a multi-speed sprocket assembly comprises a cylindrical  member (1), a sprocket sub-assembly (2-4) mounted on the  outer periphery of said cylindrical member (1) and retaining  means (5, 6, 12) provided between cylindrical member (1) and  said sprocket sub-assembly (2-4) for preventing axial move­ ment of said sprocket sub-assembly (2-4) relative to said cy­ lindrical member (1).  the cylindrical member (1) has on its  outer periphery a plurality of retaining grooves (11) extending  axially of said cylindrical member (1).  the sprocket sub-as­ sembly (2-4) has two or more sprockets (2) with different  numbers of teeth, and one or more ring-shaped washers (3)  positioned between the sprockets (2) for maintaining them in  a predetermined spaced relationship.  coupling means (4) are  provided for coupling the sprockets (2) with said washers (3).   each of the sprockets (2) has a central bore for receiving  therethrough the outer periphery of said cylindrical member  (1) and is provided at its inner periphery with a plurality of pro­ jections (21) engageable with said retaining grooves (11).  in order to enable quick and easy mounting and de­ mounting of the sprocket sub-assembly (2-4) said retaining  means (5, 6) comprises an engagement groove (12) extend­ ing circumferentially around said cylindrical member (1) and  an engagement means (5, 6) resiliently engageable with said  engagement groove (12) and disengageable therefrom  against the resilient engagement forces, so that said engage­ ment means (5, 6) may engage with said engagement groove  (12) to retain said sprocket sub-assembly (2-4) in position on  said cylindrical member (1) so as to be axially movable and so  that said engagement means (5, 6) may be disengaged from  said engagement groove (12) for removing said sprocket  sub-assembly (2-4) from said cylindrical member (1) by over­ coming said resilient engagement forces.  the engagement groove (12) is provided on one of said  cylindrical member (1) and the sprocket sub-assembly (2-4)  and said engagement means (5, 6) being provided on the oth­ er of said cylindrical member (1) and sprocket sub-assembly  (2-4).
