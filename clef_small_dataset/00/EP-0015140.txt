<DESCRIPTION>
thermolysis of 2-(3-aryl-isoxazol-5-yl)benzoic acids, salts and halides from 3'-(aryl)-spiito[isosenzofuran- l(3h) ,5 (4'h)isoxazol]-3-ones this invention relates to the preparation of 2-(3-aryl-5-isoxazolyl)benzoic acids, salts or halides thereof by treatment of 3'-(aryl)-spiro[isobenzofuran1(3h),5'(4'h)-isoxazol)-3-one with heat, strong base or a reactive halide in water. belgian patent 837,454 discloses such isoxazolyl benzoates to be effective plant growth regulants. isoxazol-5-yl benzoates are usually prepared by conversion of isoxazolin-5-yl benzoate with n-bromosuccinimide or dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone. however, isoxazolin-5-yl benzoates are prepared from vinyl benzoates which are difficult to prepare. in accordance with the novel aspects of the present invention, 3-aryl-isoxazol-5-yl benzoic acids or salts thereof are prepared by thermolysis or base treatment of 3'-(aryl)-spirol[isobenzofuran-1 (3h), 5' '4'h)-isoxazol]-3-ones. 3-(aryl)-spiro[isobenzofuran-l (3h),5' (4'h)-isoxazol]-3-one starting materials are prepared by reaction of a nitrile oxide with 3-methylenephthalide in accordance with the following equation: emi1.1 since the aryl radical takes no appreciable part in the reaction, any aromatic radical or heteroaromatic radical, e.g., pyridyl, may be used. preferably, however, aryl is a radical of the following formula emi2.1 wherein x and y are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halo-lower-alkyl, phenoxy, phenyl and cyanose as used herein, the terms "lower alkyl" and "lower alkoxy" are understood to include those alkyl and alkoxy groups having up to five carbon atoms7 inclusive. both straight as well as branched chain alkyl groups are contemplated. the term "halo-lower-alkyl" as used herein is understood to mean those lower-alkyl groups in which at least one, and perhaps all, of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by halogen atoms. it is to be clearly understood that trifluoromethyl is contemplated as being a halo-lower-alkyl moiety. the term "halogen" as used herein includes chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine. more specifically, the 2-(3-aryl-5-iso-xazolyl) benzoic acids or salts and halides thereof may be prepared in accordance wit the following reaction scheme: emi2.2 where aryl is as defined above. in accordance with the process of the invention, the benzoic acid is prepared by heating the spiro coflpounc at atmospheric pressure to above its melting point for a short period of time, normally less than one hour. heating the spiro compounds for short periods of time at a temperature just above their melting point results in the conversion of said compound to the desired acid. in industrial applications, it may be found to be convenient to dissolve the spiro compound in a suitable solvent and heat the solution to convert the spiro compound to the desired acid. the amount of heat applied is not critical but should be that amount which is sufficient to convert said spiro compound to the desired acid. conversion at temperatures below about 1000c is feasible but will be very slow. temperatures above 100 c, and especially 125 c. up to said reflux temperature, will result in satisfactory conversion. however, heating the solution from temperatures just above the melting point of the spiro starting material to the reflux temperature of the solution is preferred to effect rapid and effective conversion. the solvent utilized is not critical. any solvent
