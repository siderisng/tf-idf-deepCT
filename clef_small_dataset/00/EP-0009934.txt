<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a new form of manganese dioxide  having an x-ray diffraction pattern resembling none of the  x-ray patterns of the known forms of manganese dioxide,  together with a method for its manufacture by acid treatment  of limn₂0₄.  the manganese dioxide of the invention is useful  in the manufacture of cathodes for electrochemical cells and  there is also disclosed an electrochemical cell in which at  least a portion of the cathode comprises the new form of  manganese dioxide.
