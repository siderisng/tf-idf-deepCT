<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for cleaning the surface of a rotating roller (1).   first and second cleaning blades (8, 9) each have an edge  extending axially across the surface of the roller and adjacent  thereto, the edges being parallel and directed against the  direction of rotation of the roller.  the edge of the second blade  (9) is disposed behind the edge of the first blade (8) relative to  the direction of rotation.  means are provided for causing rela­ tive movement of the blades to reverse the disposition of the  edges and cause the edge of the blade (9) to scrape that  surface of the blade (8) which faces towards the roller.  during  such movement the blade (9) is moved so that its edge con­ tacts the roller to keep a constant cleaning action.  the edge of  blade (8) scrapes the surface of blade (9) as the blades return  to their original disposition.
