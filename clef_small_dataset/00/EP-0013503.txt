<ABSTRACT>
a method of adhering a textile fabric tennis ball cover  (12,13) to a tennis ball core (22) comprises providing yarns  (16) made from a hot-melt adhesive in the cover fabric, fitting  the cover around the core, causing the hot-melt adhesive  yarns (16) to melt and come into close contact with the core  and the cover, and allowing the molten adhesive to re-solidify  so that it adheres to the cover and the core of the tennis ball  with a high degree of tenacity.  this method requires few  steps, and is in consequence much quicker, than the convenÂ­ tional method using a two-part solvent based latex adhesive  between the cover and the core.
