<ABSTRACT>
device for scanning a document by means of photosensors examining the document line by line.  on the basis of a luminous image from the line to be scanned, a plate of scanning photosensors (1) formulates, by accumulation of electrical charges, a datum relating to this line.  so that the quantity of light supplied to the document during the formulation of this datum is constant, a reference photosensor (15) is illuminated by the same light source as the document.  at the instant when the scanning of a line begins, a measuring device (15 and 30 to 35), comprising the reference photosensor (15), begins to measure the quantity of light supplied to the document.  when this quantity reaches a specified value, a signal (p) is produced which triggers the reading of the accumulated charges.  application to facsimile apparatuses.  <image>
