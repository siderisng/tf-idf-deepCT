<ABSTRACT>
an exhaust nozzle control and core engine fuel control  for a turbofan engine serving to optimize thrust during  steady state and transient operation modes of a turbofan  engine of the mixed flow type by adjusting or trimming the  exhaust nozzle area as a function of fan pressure ratio and  fan rotor speed and by adjusting or trimming the core engine  fuel flow as a function of fan rotor speed and or turbine inlet  temperature.  the control serves to enhance stability by  assuring airflow in the engine and its inlet is within a given  value avoiding inlet buzz and high distortion to the engine  and avoiding even transient operation in conditions that  might cause compressor flow instability or stall.  fuel flow is  adjusted or trimmed as a function of fan rotor speed or  turbine inlet temperature limits depending on which is  calling for the least amount of fuel.
