<ABSTRACT>
1.  saw blade for cutting wood and similar materials, with saw teeth (3) of trapezium form, the cutting edges (4) of which are arranged in the longitudinal direction of the saw blade (1) on the short external side of the trapezium and are interrupted, for each saw tooth, by a gap (5 ; 11), characterized in that each gap (5 ; 11) is limited by two parallel or two downwardly divergent side walls (6, 7 ; 12, 13), in that the width of opening of each gap (5, 11) is approximately equal to one third of the short trapezium side of the saw tooth, in that the depth of the gaps (5 ; 11) is approximately equal to half the tooth height (h), and in that the bottom of the gap (8) is rounded in arcuate form.
