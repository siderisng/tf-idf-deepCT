<ABSTRACT>
a method of making a supporting grid for tubes and  such a grid comprising a central reticular structure formed of  main (1,2) and secondary (3,4) intersecting strips.  an inner  annular frame is formed in the same material as that of the  strips so as to tightly receive therein the ends of said strips,  said inner fram being higher than the reticular structure so  that lower and upper projecting portions are created  together with cleaning ducts.  an external annular frame of a  different material and axially extending inward facing dogs  are provided at the inner portion of said external frame.  the  inner frame (7) and the external frame are assembled such  that at room temperature said dogs fit tightly to theinner  cylindrical surface of said projecting portions, while play (17)  existing between the external cylindrical surface of the inner  frame and the external frame allows the free thermal  expansion of the two materials.
