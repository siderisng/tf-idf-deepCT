<ABSTRACT>
there is a need for apparatus which simulates signals  received by a radar antenna.  such apparatus is needed for  testing radar equipment and for training purposes.  hitherto it has not been possible to simulate accurately  signals which are likely to occur in a real-life situation where a  three dimensional radar is being used to detect numerous  objects some of which may be moving, some of which may be  emitters of radiation and some of which may merely reflect  radiation emitted by the radar.  these needs are met by the  illustrated apparatus in which the trajectories of the objects  are recorded in a computer (1).  the positions of the objects at  any one time are held in a store (3) from which azimuth and  elevation signals (g,g′) are read out.  two stores (5,5′) hold  respectively the horizontal and vertical polar diagram charac­ teristics of an antenna.  the appropriate values are read out of  these stores by the signals (g,g′) and the outputs from the  stores are combined to give a final attenuation signal (j)  which is used to control the amplitude of an r. f.  signal  thereby producing a realistic simulated signal.  the polar diagram characteristics of an antenna may be  different for transmission and reception.  to take this into  account each store (5,5′) may have a duplicate (9,9′), the  outputs from all four stores being combined to produce the  simulated signal.
