<ABSTRACT>
a data bus system is disclosed which includes a plu­ rality of interconnected active terminals (1, 2, 3, 4), i,e. ,  terminals which receive serial data from one terminal and  retransmit it or transmit new data to another terminal.  the  data is transmitted within a continuous series of time frames  of predetermined length with each time frame being initiated  by a control word transmitted by one of the terminals de­ signated the controller terminal (e. g.  1 or 3).  each terminal  includes a counter which counts the bits between control  words, and each control word identifies the controller ter­ minal so that each terminal can synchronize its counter  with the counter at the controller terminal in accordance  with the propagation time of data from the controller ter­ minal.  logic circuitry at each terminal enables one (e. g.   1 or 3) of a plurality of the terminals to assume the func­ tion of the controller terminal should the presently de­ signated controller terminal fail to generate control words.   the system can therefore continue to operate in the event  of partial interruption of the bus.  within each time frame,  the terminals initiate data at times in accordance with the  counts of their counters, and the transmitted data identi­ fies each receiving terminal which directs it to users tied  to that terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in and relating to data transmission systems the present invention relates to data bus systems for interconnecting and transmitting information between a plurality of serially arranged terminals, and more particularly, it relates to data busses of the active type in which each terminal receives data from one terminal and transmits or retransmits data to the next terminal in the system. the data bus concept of placing all data onto a single transmission line, or set of transmission lines, and then receiving the data along the line as needed has revolutionized computer architecture and has been instrumental in the development of the microprocessor. this concept is presently being developed for distributing data over larger distances, for example on shipboard, to replace the conventional data distribution systems wherein all receivers and transmitters are directly wired into a central computer or processing unit or wherein a central switchboard functions to distribute messages from and to the various transmitting and receiving units. such bus systems have the obvious advantage of considerably reducing the amount of cabling required - a factor which can be of considerable importance in the longer distribution systems. problems are encountered in connection with the longer distribution systems however. for example, at high data rates (i.e., in the megabit range or higher) a propagation time between terminals on the bus becomes important and can lead to errors in the received data. also, with long lines between terminals, the problem of a cable break disabling the entire bus system can become significant. there are two basic types of data busses which are used in large scale data distribution at the present time, namely, passive busses and active busses. the more typical passive bus system employs transmitters, or drivers, and receivers that couple passively to a transmission line. the active bus, on the other hand, employs active terminals, each of which receives data from one terminal and then retransmits the data (or transmits new data) to the next terminal in the line, with each terminal acting as a potential transmitting and/or receiving point. thus, in an active data bus, each link between terminals comprises a complete transmission path, whereas in the passive data busses the entire length of the transmission line comprises a single transmission path. passive bus systems have a number of disadvantages. for example, a passive transmission line is terminated in its characteristic impedance at each end thereof to absorb the data signal and prevent reflections along the line. the receivers, which tap into the line, must not load the line and will therefore have high impedance inputs. to prevent the transmitters, or drivers, from loading the line, they must be removed from the line when not introducing data which thus has the obvious disadvantage of requiring the rapid switching of power sources into and out of the transmission line. a variation of the foregoing passive bus system is presently in use wherein all drivers and receivers communicate with the main bus line through separate transmission lines called "stubs". since
