<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for controlling the actuation of a light for  illuminating the work zone adjacent the operative end of a  dental handpiece.  the apparatus comprises (a) means  (16) for actuating a light source (10) when a signal is  transmitted to the actuating means from the power transmitting  means (4) for the dental handpiece (6), (b) means  (20) for transmitting the signal to the actuating means (16)  from the power transmitting means (4) for the handpiece,  and (c) delay shutoff means (15) associated with the  actuating means (16) for maintaining the light source (10)  on for a predetermined period of time after transmission of  power to the operative end of the handpiece is terminated  and then causing the light source to be extinguished at the  end of the predetermined period of time.  this enables the  dentist to examine the oral cavity just after working on it,  and avoids dazzling him if he wants to examine the handpiece  at other times.
