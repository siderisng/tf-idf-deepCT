<ABSTRACT>
an improved method and apparatus is provided to conÂ­ trol the moisture content of pulp which is discharged from a  press.  during operation of the press (14) slurry containing the  pulp enters the press (14) and engages a screw (28) which is  rotated to feed the pulp upwardly in the press (14).  as the wet  pulp moves upwardly, water is removed from the pulp.  in  order to further reduce the moisture content of the pulp, a  restrictor member or cone (60) in the press outlet (42) is  effective to compress the pulp against helical flighting (38) of  the screw (28).  in order to maintain the moisture content of the  discharged pulp substantially constant with variations in wet  pulp consistency and to prevent overloading of the press  drive motor (32) the restrictor cone (60) is movable axially  along the screw drive shaft (34) to vary the extent to which it  restricts the press outlet (42).  the restrictor cone (60) is moved  along the screw drive shaft (34) under the influence of forces  applied against the outer surface (64) of the cone (60) by the  wet pulp.  this movement of the cone (60) adjusts the extent to  which the outlet (42) from the press is restricted and the extent  to which the wet pulp is compressed with variations in the  consistency of the wet pulp.
