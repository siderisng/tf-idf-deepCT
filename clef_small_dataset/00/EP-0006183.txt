<ABSTRACT>
an improved latch assembly adapted particularly for use in  the electronics or communications industry to retain a plug  member (11) in electrical engagement with a receptacle (40)  and prevent relative movement therebetween in a latching direc­ tion.  the latch assembly includes a first latch member (24)  adapted for limited movement in a direction generally parallel to  the latching direction between first and second positions and for  limited movement in a direction generally perpendicular to the  latching direction between engaged and disengaged positions.   the latch assembly further includes a spring member (19) for  biasing the first latch member (24) toward an engaged position,  a stop member (35) for limiting the movement of the first latch  member (24) in a direction opposite the latching direction and a  guide member (35) for causing movement of and guiding the  first latch member (24) toward its second position during move­ ment of the latch member (24) toward its disengaged position.
