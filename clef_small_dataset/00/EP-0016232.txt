<ABSTRACT>
a shoe (1) the upper (3) of which includes on its inner or  outer surface vertically extending groove-like recesses (2) or  dot-like recesses (4), arrayed in an appropriate manner.  this  a feature improves the flexibility of the upper (3) and prevents  the stretching of the upper.  as a result, the shoe fits a foot well  and enhances movement when worn, owing to the light feelÂ­ ing thereof the shoe alleviates fatigue and is excellent in  durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification shoe technical field this invention relates to improved shoes made of leather or synthetic leather, said shoes having insteps formed either with vertical grooves or with dimples so that the insteps may easily bend and be prevented from unwanted expansion and so that the shoes may fit well to the feet and have a greater durability. technical background unlike cotton canvas of which the insteps of canvas shoes are made, natural or synthetic flat leather of which the insteps of conventional leather shoes are made cannot be vulcanized and, consequently, is difficult to be fitted to a shoemaker's last. as a consequence, the insteps of conventional leather shoes bend in a random manner in use. because bulging portions, sunken portions and/or wrinkles, are liable to be left on the surfaces of the insteps, the conventional leather shoes do not fit to the feet so well. another drawback of the conventional leather shoes is that, because the side portions of the insteps wardly follow the bending of the feet, they are not comfortable to wear but are aft to fatigue the feet and the insteps are apt to be damaged with the fatigue of the material after a short period of use. because they are made of natural or synthetic leather not particularly processed for flexibility, their insteps bend and stretch in a rather unnatural manner in use. thus, the unwanted expansion of leather with the prolonged use makes the conventional leather shoes ill-fitting and deteriorates their perrormance. their insteps bend in a random manner in use, forming wrinkles on the surfaces of the insteps and making the conventional leather shoes shabby and susceptible to qamage. an object of the present invention is to provide shoes which obviate the above-mentioned shortcomings and are ell-fitting to the feet, comfortable to wear, and highly durable. disclosure of the invention the present invention provides improved shoes having the insteps formed either with vertical grooves or with dimples in a suitable arrangement so that t insteps may easily bend and be prevented from unante expansion and so that the shoes may be well-fittin to the feet, comfortable to wear, highly durable, and highly efficient in sports. brief explanation of the drawings figs. 1 and 2 are a schematic view and a sectional view, respectively, of a shoe according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. figs. 3 and t are a schematic view and a sectional view, respectively, of a shoe according to another embodiment of the present invention. preferred embodiment for working the invention in order to make a detailed explanation of the present invention, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings. referring to figs. 1 and 2, the numeral 1 designates a shoe, and the numeral 2 designates depressions provided in the side portion of an instep 3. the depressions 2 may be provided either on the vamp only or on the whole side portion of the instep 3. the depressions 2 are formed by pressing. although they are in
