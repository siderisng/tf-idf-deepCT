<ABSTRACT>
a record is obtained of repetitive optical phenomena  having durations in the picosecond or subpicosecond range  by synchronising the deflection of the electron image in an  electron-optical streaking image tube (10) with the repetition  rate of a pulse train from a continuous wave mode-locked  laser (20, 21) which supplies such pulses to the tube.   synchronisation may be effected by supplying a reference  frequency signal both to the laser (21) and to the deflection  electrodes (15) in the image tube (10).  the signal applied to  the deflection electrodes (15) may comprise a synchronised  sinusoidal voltage signal and a slowly varying bias voltage  signal.  an optical multichannel analyser may be used at the  output of the image tube (10), linked to an oscilloscope or  pen recorder.
