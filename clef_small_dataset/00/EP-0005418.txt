<ABSTRACT>
a fastening element (16) for the interconnection of gratings  (10, 11).  the fastening element is of i-shape and intended to be  placed between the edge steel members (13) of two juxtaposed  gratings so that the steel members rest on the supporting  surfaces (21) formed on the lower flange (17) of the fastening  element.  the upper flange (18) of the fastening element has  lugs (20) which are bent out of a flange side face in one direction  longitudinally of the edge steel members.  after the mounting of  the fastening element said side face of the flange (18) is bent  down into engagement with the upper edge surfaces of the edge  steel members (13) whereby the lugs (20) are pushed down  outside the remote side faces of the edge steel members (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
load transmitting fastening elements for gratings when walkways or other supporting surfaces are formed with the aid of gratings which are placed in juxtaposition between two seatings, there may arise some difference in level between two freely juxtaposed gratings if one of the gratings is subjected to load or if both gratings are subjected to loads of different sizes. with large span widths and with gratings of insufficient strength the difference in level between the gratings may be particularly noticeable by and risky to pedestrians trafficking the walkwaxs. it has therefore been found necessary to unite the juxtaposed gratings in some way or other. usually, this has been done by screwing together the gratings before the laying thereof, or by connecting them together in sone other manner with the aid of fastening elements, e.g. according to the published swedish patent application 7403682-3. the prior-art connecting methods and fastening elements have, however, been troublesome in use and have often made it necessary to mount the fastening elements before the laying of the gratings, or to insert the fastening elements from below. the present invention has for its object to provide a simple fastening element which after the laying of the gratings can be mounted in a simple manner without making it necessary to lift the gratings in relation to each other or to insert the fastening element from below. to this end, the fastening element is substantially of i-shape having upper and lower flanges and a web between the flanges, which is adapted to extend downwards between the edge steel members of two juxtaposed gratings and which is of substantially the same length as the height of the edge steel members at right angles to the plane of the gratings, the lower flange of the fastening element being formed as a supporting surface for supporting the edge steel members of the gratings, while the upper flange of the fastening element has holding lugs which are bent out of a flange side face in one direction longitudinally of the edge steel members, and which, after the mounting of the fastening element under downward bending of said side face of the upper flange into engagement with the upper edges of the edge steel members, are adapted to project downwardly outside the remote side faces of the two edge steel members. the invention will be described in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawing in which: fig. 1 shows a fastening element according to the invention, as seen from one large side; fig. 2 is a view taken on the line ii-ii in fig. 1; fig. 3 is a view taken on the line iii-iii in fig. 1; fig. 4 is a section of two juxtaposed gratings which have been united by means of a fastening element according to the invention; fig. 5 is a section taken on the line v-v in fig. 4; fig. 6 is a plan view taken on the line vi-vi in fig. 4. fig. 4 shows two

<CLAIMS>
 claims    1. a fastening element for interconnecting juxtaposed gratings (10, 11) extending between seatings and having edge steel members (13) along their side edges between said seatings, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the fastening element (16) is substantially of i-shape having upper and lower flanges (17, 18) and a web (19) between the flanges, which is adapted to extend downwards between the edge steel members of two juxtaposed gratings and which is of substantially the same length as the height of the edge steel members at right angles to the plane of the gratings, the lower flange (17) of the fastening element being formed as a supporting surface (21) for supporting the edge steel members (13) of the gratings, while the upper flange (18) of the fastening element has holding lugs (20) which are bent out of a flange side face in one direction longitudinally of the edge steel members,   and which, after the mounting of the fastening element under downward bending of said side face of the upper flange (18) into engagement with the upper edges of the edge steel members (13), are adapted to project downwardly outside the remote side faces of the two edge steel members   (13).       2. a fastening element as claimed in claim 1, c h ar a c t e r i s e d in that the lower flange (17) is of a height larger than the thickness thereof.    3. a fastening element as claimed in claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the edge surfaces (22) of the upper flange (18), which before the mounting of the fastening element (16) face the supporting surfaces (21) of the lower flange (17), are inclined upwardly and outwardly from the web (19) of the fastening element.
