<ABSTRACT>
an electrical cooking plate for a cooker or such like having a glass ceramic plate which is arranged at a distance above an electrical heating element.  the heating element consists of a helically wound heating resistor (5), which is supported in a spiral arrangement in a dielectric body (2).  in order to ensure that a large proportion of the heat generated is transferred by radiation onto the glass ceramic plate and that only a small amount of heat is conducted to the dielectric body (2), the heating resistor (5) is jammed between rows of pins (3) on the dielectric body (2).  <image>
