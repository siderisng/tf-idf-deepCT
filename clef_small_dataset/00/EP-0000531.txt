<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the preparation of dialkoxyphosphonoalkylcarbamates of the formula  see diagramm : ep0000531,p5,f5  in which r1 and r2 are identical or different alkyl radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, r3 is hydrogen or the ch3 group, r4 is hydrogen, (c1-4 ) alkyl or the group  see diagramm : ep0000531,p5,f7  in which a is (c2-4 ) alkylene, n is 1 or 2, by reacting dialkylphosphites of the formula see diagramm : ep0000531,p6,f1  in which r1 and r2 are defined as in the formula i, with alkenylcarbamates of the formula  see diagramm : ep0000531,p6,f2  in which r3 and n are defined as in the formula i and r'4 is hydrogen, (c1-4 )alkyl or the group  see diagramm : ep0000531,p6,f3  in which a, n and r3 are defined as in the formulae i and ii, at elevated temperature and in the presence of peroxides as catalysts, which comprises using the dialkylphosphites iii and the alkenylcarbamates iv, if r'4 is hydrogen or a (c1-4 )alkyl group, in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 or, if r'4 in the alkenylcarbamates iv is the group v, in a molar ratio of 2:1.
