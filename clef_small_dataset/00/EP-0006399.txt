<ABSTRACT>
a pivotal joint in which a first member (10) having a  wheel-shaped end (18) is pivotally connected to a second  member (12) having a forked end (22) enveloping the  wheel-shaped end and including a primary pivot bolt (30)  arrangement extending through the first and second mem­ bers at the center of the wheel-shaped end to pivotally  join the parts, as the primary pivotal connection there­ between and wherein the forked end of the second mem­ ber presents a circumferential array of three friction sur­ faces (24, 26, 28) which will cooperate with the periphery  (20) of the wheel-shaped end of the first member to pivo­ tally join the two parts as the secondary pivotal connec­ tion therebetween if the primary pivot connection fails.
