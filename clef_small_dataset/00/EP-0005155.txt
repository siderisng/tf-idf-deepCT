<ABSTRACT>
The attachment of nozzles (wearing part) at the burner body of a machine burner is previously done by means of union nuts, which are also very large according to the nozzle size and must be tightened with keys of large width.This is often problematic for constructive reasons, especially for multi-burner aggregates, which are associated with several nozzles in the narrowest space, often problematic.The invention is therefore based on the object to provide a simpler nozzle attachment and proposes to attach the nozzle to the burner body by means of a special locking socket.In this way, a simple nozzle attachment in the burner body is obtained, while at the same time a gas-tight arrangement of the nozzle in the burner body is guaranteed.
