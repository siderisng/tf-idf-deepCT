<ABSTRACT>
a device for sensing the frequency of an alternating  electrical input signal.  an autocorrelator (ac) at an input  to the device generates a signal having a periodic compo­ nent of frequency equal to four times the frequency of any  periodic component in the input signal.  the amplitude of  non-periodic components is substantially reduced.  the  autocorrelator (ac) is followed by a series of sixteen fre­ quency dividers (fd) whose outputs are applied to respec­ tive comparators (gc).  within each comparator (gc) the  signal from a divider is compared with one of sixteen win­ dow signals, each representing a predetermined range of  periods.  any output from the comparator (gc) is converted  to a binary decimal form and is applied to a qualifier cir­ cuit (qc).  the qualifier circuit only gives an output if at  least eleven of the last eighteen signals applied thereto  have represented a signal whose period lies within the  same one of the predetermined ranges of periods.
