<ABSTRACT>
alkali metal delta manganese dioxide hydrage, which is  obtained as a by-product in the industrial oxidation of  organics by kmnoâ‚„ is subjected to ion exchange reaction with  rare earth ions of the ceria subgroup (viz.  cerium, lanthanum,  etc. ).  by employing favorable temperature and ph conditions,  a reaction product can be produced containing as little as 0. 03  moles of alkali metal per mole of manganese, and up to one  mole of ceria rare earth per six moles of manganese.  the  separated product is prepared for catalytic use in the form of  dried porous pellets.  the resulting oxidation catalyst has high  efficiency, long life, and optimum activity at reasonable  temperatures.  the catalyst can be used advantageously for  applications such as the oxidation and deodorization of  exhaust gases from paint drying ovens.

<DESCRIPTION>
rare earth-manganese oxidation catalysts and process of producing oxidation catalysts containing manganese and a polyvalent metal, such as copper, cobalt, or silver, have been in commercial use for many years. they are referred to as "hopcalites". the hopcalite catalyst containing copper with manganese has been commonly used in gas masks io- oxidation of carbon monoxide. hopcalites may be formed by the coprecipitation of mno2, with cu(oh)2 or other polyvalent metal hydroxide. (sec, for example, united states patent 1, 345, 323 of 1920). manganese catalysts containing copper or other polyvalent metal have also beer prepared from a solution of the metal salt and potassium permanganate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. (united states patent 1 971 168 (1934), and united states patent 1 995 353 (1935).) the resulting catalyst is an acid manganate of the copper or other polyvalent metal, such as, for example, cu(hmno3)2 as far as is known, such acid manganate catalysts have not found commercial applications. dodman et al in u.s. patent 3 700 605 (1972) describe a procedure for preparing a manganese catalyst by first forming a manganese oxide precipitate from potassium permanganate in the presence of alkali metal hydroxide. the recovered precipitate is resuspended in water, & d an aqueous solution of a salt of a polyvalent metal is introduced into the suspension to react therewith. the patent reco-mends the use of cobalt, copper, silver or lead ions to replace the alkali metal in the pre cipntate. this ion exchange reaction is described as being carried out at ambient tenperature (e.g. 200c). no ph adjustment is disclosed. dodman et al propose that an inert insoluble substance (e.g. kieselguhr or silica) should be suspended in the potassium permanganate solution as it is converted to the manganese dioxide precipitate, thereby providing a catalyst support. dodman et al did not propose the use of "by-product" manganese dioxide as a starting material for catalyst preparation. however, the by-product manganese dioxide resulting from the use of potassiun per^nnganate to o.- idize organic substances under alkaline conditions is chenically similar to the manganese dioxide precipitate prepared by dodman et al. chemically, they are both alkali metal delta manganese dioxide hydrate. during the course of the experimental work leading to the present invention, it was found that aqueous solutions of cobalt or copper nitrate could be reacted with by-product manganese dioxide under the conditions described by dodnan et al and that the resulting products had catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. however, for certain applications (viz. paint drying ovens) the cobalt or copper catalysts are not as efficient and do not have as long catalyst life as desirable. when an attempt was nade to react a solution of cerium nitrate with by-product manganese dioxide under the conditions described by dolman et al, the resulting product still contained an appreciable amount of alkali metal and was not suitable for use as an oxidation catalyst. further discoveries lead to the development of a process for producing rare earth-manganese oxidation catalysts of superior properties. this catalyst and
