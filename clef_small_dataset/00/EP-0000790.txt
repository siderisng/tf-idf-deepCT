<ABSTRACT>
the production of phosphazene polymers represented  by the general formula    wherein n is an integer from 7 to upwards of 50,000 wherein  one or more kinds of or or orâ€² groups is attached to the  phosphorus atoms in a substantially linear chain of alternating  p and n atoms, the groups when more than one group is  present being randomly distributed along the pn backbone, is  enhanced by employing a single solvent for both each of the  reactants (polydihalophosphazene and either aryloxide  and/or alkoxide) and for the product (phosphazene polymer).   by this expedient, the formation of the desired product is  achieved in a homogeneous system rather than in a  heterogeneous system as in the prior art where different solvents  were employed for each of the reactants and for the  reaction products.
