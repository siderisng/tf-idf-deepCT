<ABSTRACT>
monitoring apparatus particularly suitable for sensing  liquid level comprises a housing (11) of light transmitting  material with a monitoring lens (17), a directional light source  (18) in the housing arranged so that light emitted is directed to  the lens (17), and a monitorable light sensitive device (12)  mounted in the housing (11) at a position from the light path  between the source (18) and the lens (17).  the light intensity  monitored by the sensitive device differs when the device is in  air to when it is in a liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
monitoring apparatus this invention relates to monitoring apparatus. applications for monitoring apparatus, especially for level sensing, are numerous and todate such sensing has been accomplished mainly by mechanically actuated conducting devices or by observation. for example, float devices have been widely used for indicating liquid levels within tanks as has observation which can be in an indirect form, such as by dipping a dip stick to check say oil level in a motor. such basic methods have been widely used and have not been superseded todate because of the lack of suitable alternatives capable of operating reliably and being inexpensive to install. however, there have been attempts to provide electronic sensing means whereby electrically conductive probes are arranged to activate an electronic circuit to indicate the presence of the medium to be monitored. the application of such presently available electronic devices is extremely limited depending upon the medium to be monitored. for example, it is difficult to monitor acids and alkalies or electrically conductive liquids. the present invention has been devised to provide monitoring apparatus which will overcome the disadvantages of the presently available apparatus and which will be reliable and efficient in operation. other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description. with the foregoing and other objects in view, this invention resides broadly in monitoring apparatus including: a housing formed of light transmitting materi & a monitoring lens on said housing; a directional light source mounted within said housing so as to direct the light emitted therefror towards said monitoring lens; a monitorable light sensitive device mounted in said housing and disposed remote from the light path between said light source and said lens, in order that the invention may be more readily understood and put into practical effect, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate the invention bnd wherein: : fig. 1 illustrates a preferred form of monitoring apparatus made in accordance with the present inventions fig. 2 illustrates the embodiment f fig. 1 immersed in a liquid; fig. 3 is a typical switching circuit including the monitoring apparatus of fig. 1; fig. 4 is a side view of a practical embodiment of the invention; fig. 5 illustrates diagrammatically a further embodiment of the invention applied to monitor the sump oil level of a motor; and fig. 6 illustrates the application of the invention to a flow meter. as shown in fig. i, the monitoring apparatus 10 comprises a light emitting diode 11 behind which a cadmium sulphide cell 12 is encapsulated in a translucent epoxy material 13 to form a simple integral unit which, in this embodiment, is provided with three connection leads, one lead 14 being a common connection to the cadmium sulphide cell 12 and the lightemitting diode 11 and the remaining two leads, 15 and 16, being direct connections to the cadmium sulphide cell and the light emitting diode, respectively. conventionally, light emitting diodes are provided with a substantial3 part-spherical end cap 17 which
