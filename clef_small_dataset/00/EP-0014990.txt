<ABSTRACT>
a wheel for trotting sulkies having a central wheel portion  (10) comprising a rim (11) and a hub portion (12) centrally  supported within the rim; and two discs (13a, 13b) secured to  either side of the central wheel portion.  the discs (13a, 13b) are engaged between a substantially  radially inwardly aligned surface (36) on the rim and a sub­ stantially radially outwardly aligned surface (37) on the hub  portion so that the discs contribute to the radial strength of the  wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in or relating to wheels the invention relates to a wheel and in particular to a wheel for a trotting sulky in which a central wheel portion is provided with a pair of substantially continuous discs gl either side thereof heretofore wheels for trotting sulkies have commonly comprised a pressed metal rini attached to a hub by means of wire spokes. light plastic discs have in the past been attached over the greater area cf the spokes to prevent horses hooves ineerçerillc, with the spokes. the wheels used heretofore have, even when formed from lightweight materials, been relatively heavy and are expensive owing to the relative3.y high cost of assembly. further, the discs attached to the wheels merely add to the weight of the wheel without contributing at all to the strength of the wheel. the invention as claimed is intended to provide a remedy. it solves the problem of the prior art wheels by providing a central wheel portion moulded from lightweight material and havinc discs attached to either side thereof in such a manner as to absorb at least some cf the radial stresses applied to the wheel rim. accordingly, in one aspect, the invention consists in a wheel comprising a central wheel portion including a rim to receive a tyrejand a hub centrally and axially supported within said rim; and a pair of substantially continuous circular discs fitted to either side of said central wheel portion the outer peripheries of said discs engaging the external surface of said rim on opposite sides cf the axial centreline of said rim, the centres of said discs engaging about opposite ends of said hub in a further aspect the invention consists in a method of forming a wheel, said method including the steps of forming a central wheel portion comprising a rim and a hub axially supported centrally within said rim; forming two substantially continuous discs; engaging the outer peripheries of each of said discs with the external surface of said rim on opposite sides of the axial centreline of said rim and engaging the central portion of each of said discs about opposite outer ends of said hub portion. preferred forms of the wheel in accordance with the invention and a preferred method of forming the same will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: fig. 1 shows a side elevational view of a wheel formed in accordance with the invention having one of the disc members removed therefrom; fig. 2 shows a view along the line ii-ii in fig. 1; fig. 3 shows a similar view to fig.1 with the disc in place on the wheel; ig. 4 showna view along the line iv-iv in fig. 1, and fig. 5 shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the central hub portion of a wheel formed in accordance with the invention with additional components in place for fitting to a dead axle. according to one aspect of the invention a wheel is provided comprising a
