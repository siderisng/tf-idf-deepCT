<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure is concerned with time-clock recording  and computation that, through a novel clock track card and  separate clock track and data channel optical reading, in  cooperation with microprocessor calculation, storage and  control, enables automating employee time and attendance  and similar data in a format directly recordable on the card  and also directly useable by payroll or other processing comÂ­ puters and the like.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to method of an apparatus for time-clock recording an computation purposes and the like, such as in connection with employee's time cards and related uses, being more particularly concerned with the automating of employee time and attendance and similar systems, and in a manner and format readily and directly recordable on the time cards and directly useable by payroll processing or other computer equipment or the like. while the invention will hereinafter be described with particular reference to the preferred application to the problem of automating the process of recording employee work hours, it will be understood that this is illustrative of an important usage of the invention which is also adaptable, as hereinafter discussed, to other uses wherein similar needs are involved. current recording of employee or related attendance is still most generally accomplished manually by means of mechanical clocks that stamp the beginning and ending times upon the employee's time card. the computation of elapsed time is then also effected manually, usually by a supervisor. this computation may be fairly complex, taking into account various company policies for early arrivals, late arrivals, overtime, sick time, holiday time, vacation time, and other factors. companies that use computers for preparation of payrolls must then keypunch this information onto tabulating cards, magnetic tape, or disks, so that the information is in a form useable by the computer. several approaches to the problem of automating such a process have been made with varying degrees of improvement. among these proposals have been systems assigning each employee a magnetic or punched badge which can be read electronically. there are, however, several disadvantages to such an approach. these include the concern of the employee that his or her record might be altered or erroneously treated without a permanent written record such as a time card; state laws and union agreements, moreover, often requiring the specific use of time cards. apart from the problem of overcoming the inertia involved in changing from a widely used technique to a relatively new and unproven technique, furthermore, there is the difficulty involved in instantly generating new badges for new employees or to replace or accommodate for lost badges, shift changes, job accounting changes, etc., with the attendant high cost of the badges in situations where employee turn-over is high or job accounting information frequently changes. among prior machines for attempting to improve the technique, are the model 75 badge reader and model 80 optical scanner of the cincinnati time recorder co., described in their bulletin d-554-5. this device reads an employee badge and then prints the time information in ocr format onto fanfold paper tape which is stored in the device. the information is also printed for employee verification purposes on adding machine-like roll paper which can be viewed through a window as the employee is punching in and out. this record, however, cannot be retained by the employee and, indeed, is not even in a record form convenient for employee retention. at the end
