<ABSTRACT>
a foot-operated accelerator pedal (18) in a lift truck  (10) commonly provides for control of forward (14) and re­ verse (16) direction es well as acceleration (12) of the  truck (10).  directional control portions (22, 24) of the pedal  (18) are mounted on and movable relative to the accelera­ tor control portion (20) for actuating switches upon making  direct contact with the switches which are mounted on or  near the pedal (18).  a solution is offered to the common  problem or relatively short wear life associated with such  direct contact switches.  the solution includes a pedal (18)  having accelerator (20) and directional control portions  (22, 24) and switches (80f, 80r) which are actuated with­ out the need for direct contact with their actuators (92).
