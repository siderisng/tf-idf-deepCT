<ABSTRACT>
an electrical assembly comprises a substrate having an  electrical conductor thereon and an electrical terminal received  in a hole in the substrate and in electrical connection  with the conductor on the substrate, the terminal being of  unitary construction and comprising a first pair of opposed  arms together constituting a receptacle for receipt of a male  terminal pin therebetween, and a second pair of opposed  arms serving to secure the terminal in the hole in the  substrate, free end portions (9) of the arms (8) of the second  pair of arms being bent to extend away from each other and  being directly connected to the conductor (2) on the substrate  (1), and longitudinal edge portions (11) of the arms (8)  of the second pair being frictionally engaged in respective  grooves (13) in the wall of the hole (4) in the substrate (1)  thereby to secure the terminal (3) to the substrate (1).
