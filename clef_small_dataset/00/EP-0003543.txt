<ABSTRACT>
the invention deals with a transponder which mainly operates in the microwave range, is used, for example, in satellite radio, and amplifies the signals received at one frequency, converts to another frequency and retransmits them amplified.  usually, one or several amplifiers are used for each channel frequency or for each frequency band since a high gain is required.  the invention proposes to utilise the expensive amplifiers several times by simultaneously amplifying transmitted and received signals, the diplexers (10, 11) provided for isolation advantageously being integrated in channel multiplexer and demultiplexer or, in the case of single-channel systems, in receiving (2) and transmitting filters.  using transfer switches (14), any receiving channel and any transmitting channel can then be connected, or switched over in the case of a fault, to an amplifier (8) which leads to an increase in availability and reliability (figure 4c).  by utilising the amplifiers several times, the number of required active elements can be reduced which resulted in a further increase in reliability, a saving in energy and thus in smaller dimensions of the power supply.  <image>
