<ABSTRACT>
1.  a cam-free driving system for the rocking lead edge gripper (16) of a sheet fed rotary printing press, whose driving parts are in all cases joined together by turning joints, characterized in that the driving system is made up of an eight-part linkage (2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 30) in which on a first turnpin (2) with a fixed axis a turning driving crank (10) is placed for driving, by way of a link (5) one arm of a lever (7), which is turningly supported by a second turnpin (8) with a fixed axis, and furthermore the output end of the other arm of the lever (7) is designed for driving, by way of an inbetween link (12), a further lever (14, 15) whose turnpin (30) is turned by a further turning crank (25) round a third turnpin (18) with a fixed axis, the second lever supporting on its other arm (15) the lead edge gripper (16), and the first driving crank (10), controlling the rocking motion of the lead edge gripper (16), and the second driving crank (25), controlling lifting motion of the gripper, are turned at the same speed smoothly about their two axes.
