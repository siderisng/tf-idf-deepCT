<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for changing the spacer elements in a press having several tiers, which press comprises a vertically arranged supporting column with supporting fingers, associated with the individual tiers of the press, for the spacer elements, characterized in that the respective supporting column (17) can be moved in the horizontal direction and rotated about its axis (18), that two supporting fingers (25, 26) are associated with each tier (2), the mutual spacing of which support fingers (25, 26) is less than the relative dimension of the spacer elements (4) and the fingers extend outwards on both sides beyond the supporting column (17), that the respective supporting column (17) is also displaceable in the vertical direction, that, furthermore, the supporting fingers (25, 26) extend parallel to one another and support the individual spacer elements in a position transverse to the supporting fingers (25, 26) and that, finally, when the supporting column (17) is moved towards the press, support members (3), which project from the respective tier (2), are received between the supporting fingers (25, 26) such that, when the supporting column (17) is lowered, and thus the supporting fingers (25, 26), the spacer elements (4) are set down on the support members (3).
