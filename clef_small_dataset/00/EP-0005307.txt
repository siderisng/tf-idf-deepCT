<ABSTRACT>
a molten glass confluent (24) comprising discrete  domains of differently coloured glasses is formed by combining  differently coloured viscous molten glass streams  (15 and 17) in a forehearth (18) and is pressed into a  continuous sheet of variegated glass by rollers (42 and 44).   the molten glass of the confluent (24) is stirred, firstly,  coarsely by reciprocating a paddle (36) then by injecting  gas bubbles into it from below and, finally, finely by manipulating  a puddle (40) in a non-synchronous mixing pattern.   flow of the confluent (24) to the rollers (42 and 44)  is partially obstructed by a weir (50) so that a reservoir  of molten glass develops behind the weir (50).  the reservoir  is a source of supplemental glass for use as needed to  compensate for transient shortfalls in the quantity of glass  reaching the rollers (42 and 44).
