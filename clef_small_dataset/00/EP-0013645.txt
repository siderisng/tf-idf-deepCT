<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a collet (100) which has a  body (200) with a tool-receiving bore (300) extending axially  from front to rear.  a plurality of slots (410,510) are arranged to  provide the desired features in the collet (100).  the slots (410,  510) are arranged in two sets, one set (510) extending rear­ wardly from the forward end, the other set (410) extending  forwardly from the rear end.  in each set, the slots are  uniformly spaced between adjacent slots and in each set the  slots are radial and preferably an even number of slots in each  set allows for them to be located at diametrically-opposed  locations on the collet (100).  the one set (510) of slots is  located a few degrees radially offset from the other set (410)  and the combined length (l₁, l₂) of one slot from each set (410,  510) is greater than the length of the collet (100) axially.  the  length and radial location of the slots (410,510) provides a flex  beam between the closely-spaced slots (410,510) from the  first and second sets, which flex beam has a cross section  which is substantially wedged-shaped.
