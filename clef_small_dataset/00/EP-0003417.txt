<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to apparatus for filling a double-glazed  panel structure with granular material for the purposes  of insulation, shading or privacy.  known forms of  apparatus are only suitable for small structures, and are  impractical for large structures or large numbers of structures.   the apparatus of the invention is suitable for each  large structure, and includes a header (16) secured above the  panel structure (18).  a container (4) stores the granular  material (30), and ducts (12, 14, 20) lead from the container to  an inlet and an outlet of the header.  a low-pressure blower  (6) blows gas round the circuit constituted by the container,  the header and the ducts.  the header is provided with outlet  apertures which leads to the interspace of the panel structure.   the blown gas conveys the granular material from the  container to the header in a fluidised state.  in the header, at  least some of the granular material drops through the outlet  apertures into the interspace.  the panel structure may be  evacuated by allowing the granular material to drain into a  flow of conveying gas circulating in an evacuation duct (24)  running along the base of the panel structure.  the invention also relates to a method of filling a panel  structure, and to the combination of filling and evacuating  apparatus and panel structure.
