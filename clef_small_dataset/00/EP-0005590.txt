<ABSTRACT>
a charge-coupled device has a transversal filter portion  (10) having split sensing electrodes (109, 113, 117, 121, 125)  whose segments (a, b) are connected to respective output  lines (se₁, se₂), and an auxiliary portion (20) which has one  or more auxiliary split sensing electrodes (209) whose  segments (a, b) are respectively connected to the same  output lines (se₁, se₂).  there are many more sensing  electrodes in the filter portion (10) than in the auxiliary  portion (20).  in use, signal-independent charge packets are  transferred along the channel in the auxiliary portion to  provide a controllable offset signal, which can be used to  provide a controllable threshold for tone detection.  there  may additionally be a dummy portion (30) to balance the  capacitative loading of the output lines (se₁, se₂) by the  auxiliary electrodes (209).
