<ABSTRACT>
a float operated electrical switch assembly includes a  fixed part (12) having a generally linearly extending body (13)  housing a reed switch (18) aligned with the length of the body  (13), a float (14) pivotally mounted on the body (13) for move­ ment relative thereto about an axis transverse to the length of  the body (13) to a position wherein the float (14) is aligned end  to end with the body (13), and a magnet (24) carried by the  float (14) at its end adjacent the body (13), the magnet (24)  extending across the width of the float (14) and so lying trans­ verse to the body length when the float (14) and body (13) are  aligned, and, the magnet (24) having its dipole length aligned  with the length of the float (14) so as to be aligned with the  length of the body (13) when the float (14) and body (13) are  aligned, whereby part of the magnetic flux part of the magnet  (24) passes transversely through the reed switch (18) to oper­ ate the reed switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to an electrical switch assembly of the kind wherein a fixed part of the assembly carries a reed switch and acts as the mounting of the assembly for mounting the assembly on the wall of a liquid reservoir, and a float carried by said fixed part and movable relative thereto in response to changes in the level of liquid in the reservoir in use, said float carrying a magnet which in a particular location of the float relative to said fixed part operates said reed switch. it will be recognised that in the majority of cases the assembly is introduced into the reservoir by way of an aperture in the reservoir wall, the aperture in use being closed by the fixed part of the assembly. in a previously proposed arrangement of the kind specified the fixed part includes a generally linear body housing the reed switch and the float carrying the magnet is pivotally mounted on the body in such a manner that in an operative position the portion of the float carrying the magnet lies alongside the portion of the body housing the reed switch. this configuration of the assembly has the smallest thickness possible for the assembly and so determines the size of the aperture in the reservoir wall through which the assembly is inserted in use. however this smallest thickness configuration is still too thick for many applications since the portion of the float carrying the magnet and the portion of the body housing the reed switch are side by side. another previous proposal sought to achieve a slimmer configuration thus requiring a smaller mounting aperture in the reservoir wall. in this construction the fixed part again has a linear body housing the reed switch but the magnet, carried again by a float is mounted on the body for pivotal movement about an axis transverse to and intersecting the longitudinal axis of the body, the pivotal axis passing through the mid-point of the dipole length of the magnet and affording a configuration of the assembly wherein the magnet and float are aligned end to end with the body. although this construction affords a slimmer configuration it suffers from the disadvantage that unless the float occupies a position with its longitudinal axis co-incident with the axis of the body during withdrawal of the unit from the narrow aperture in the wall of the reservoir then the float will act as a latch preventing such withdrawal. since the float is pivotally mounted on the body about an axis passing through the mid-point of the float then there will be no tendency for the float to align itself with the body and thus there will be an appreciable risk that withdrawal of the unit will be obstructed. it is an object of the present invention to provide an assembly of the kind specified wherein the disadvantages of the two aforementioned assemblies are minimised. a float operated electrical switch assembly according to the invention includes a fixed part
