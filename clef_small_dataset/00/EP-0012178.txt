<ABSTRACT>
Described are benzoxazole derivatives of the general formula wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms in 5- or 6-position and R¹ and R² hydrogen, alkyl with 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a group (XO) NH, where X is a optionally by methyl or ethyl substituted ethylene group with 2 to 4 carbon atoms and n are an integer of 1 to 10, wherein at least one of the symbols R¹ and R² is different from hydrogen, or R¹ and R² together with the nitrogen atom to which they are linked are to form a 5- to 7-membered, saturated ring, which contains a further heteroatom, e.g. b. 2- (p-dimethylaminophenyl) benzoxazole-5-sulfonic acid, and salts of these compounds, methods for their preparation, e.g. b. By reacting an O-aminophenolderi vate of the formula with an NR¹R²-substituted benzoic acid or by sulfonating the corresponding benzoxazole derivative, as well as the use of such benzoxazole derivatives (I) in cosmetic agents as UV-A filters and stabilizers.
