<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic holder for releasably retaining a ferromagne­ tic object, having a core member (1) composed of a semi-hard  magnetic material magnetized permanently by an instan­ taneous discharge current from a capacitor (6) passing in a  first direction through coils (3) wound on the core member (1)  to permanently retain the object.  the capacitor discharge  current is passed in a second direction opposite to the first  through the coils (3) to demagnetize the previously magnet­ ized core member (1) to allow the object to be magnetically  released.
