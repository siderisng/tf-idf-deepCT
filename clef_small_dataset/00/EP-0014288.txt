<ABSTRACT>
an improved process for preparing oil-soluble derivaties  of unsaturated c₄-c₁₀ dicarboxylic acid materials, e. g.  the  product of the reaction of polyisobutylene and maleic anhyd­ ride, under ene reaction conditions characterized in that said  ene reaction is conducted under acidic conditions as by con­ ducting said reaction in the presence of from 0. 01 to 5 wt.  %,  based on total weight of the reactants, of an oil-soluble strong  organic acid containing a hydrogen dissociating moiety  which has a pk of less than about 4. 0, as exemplified by c₁₅ to  c₇₆ hydrocarbyl-substituted sulfonic acid, whereby sediment  resulting from said ene reaction is markedly reduced to less  than 1 wt.  %.

<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention 1. field of the invention this invention relates to high temperature process, i.e. an "ene" process, for producing oil-soluble derivatives of a monoethylenically unsaturated c4-c10 dicarboxylic acid material under conditions of reduced sediment formation as well as to the resulting substantially sedimentfree product useful for preparing ashless dispersants utilized in lubricating oil and fuel compositions. in particular, this invention is directed to a sediment-free process involving the "ene" reaction of a polyolefin and maleic anhydride to provide a precursor for the production of lubricating oil and fuel additives wherein said reaction is carried out in the presence of a sediment-preventing amount of an oil-soluble strong organic acid. 2. description of the prior art during the past several decades, ashless sludge dispersants have become increasingly important, primarily in improving the performance of lubricants in keeping the engine clean of deposits and permitting extended crankcase oil drain periods while avoiding the undesirable environmental impact of the earlier used metal-containing additives. most commercial ashless dispersants fall into several general categories. in one category, an amine or polyamine is attached to a long-chain hydrocarbon polymer (the oil-solubilizing portion of the molecule), usually polyisobutylene, through an acid group, such as a dicarboxylic acid material, e.g. succinic anhydride, by forming amide or imide linkages. in a second category, an alkanol or polyol is attached to said long-chain hydrocarbon polymer through said acid by forming an ester linkage. in yet another category, the reaction products of hydrocarbon-sbstituted succinic anhydride, e.g. polyisobuten succinic anhydride, with compounds containing both an amine group and a hydroxy group have been suggested as useful or investigated in the prior art. the common reactant in all said categories is the long-chain hydrocarbon polymer attached to a dicarboxylic acid group. the polyolefin diacid is readily obtained via the dehydrohalogenation, diels-alder or "ene" reaction of an olefin or a chlorinated olefin with an unsaturated c4 to clo dicarboxylic acid, anhydride or ester thereof, such as fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, dimethyl fumarate, etc. the dicarboxylic acid material formed via the ene reaction of an olefin with maleic anhydride results in an alkenyl-substituted anhydride which may contain a single alkenyl radical or a mixture of alkenyl radicals variously bollled to the cyclic succinic anhydride group. this "ene" product is a preferred precursor for said ashless dispersants since it does not contain any halogen which could be a source of undesired activity when said dispersant is incorporated into the lubricant or fuel. unfortunately, the "ene" reaction of an olefin and maleic anhydride is difficultly reactable and/or results in extensive sediment formation believed to be primarily poly (maleic anhydride) and decomposition products of maleic anhydride. the deleterious effect of metal ion and alkyl amine contamination upon molten maleic anhydride has been reported, by vogler et al in the "journal of chemical and engineering date", vol. 8, no. 4, pgs. 620-623 of october 1963 entitled "effect of contaminants on the thermal stability of maleic anhydride", to include heat and gas evolution and
