<ABSTRACT>
to reduce the wear and tear on the wire-cloth and drainage strips of a pulp drainage machine, in particular a papermaking machine, the surfaces of the drainage strips which cooperate with the wire are frequently made of hard materials, for example oxide ceramics.  it is proposed that such hard material or oxide ceramic parts (10) be supported by a material made of steatite or special steatite.  this support material is simple to extrude as a shaped part (1), which is simple to join, for example by adhering, to the hard material parts to form the surface which is to cooperate with the wire.  the substantial conformity in the thermal expansion coefficient of the chosen support material and the thermal expansion coefficient of oxide ceramic parts here reduces the risk of cracking in the oxide ceramic parts due to thermal stresses.  the strength and surface properties of the chosen support material reduce the wear and tear in particular on drainage strips formed as foils and also on the wire-cloth.  <image>
