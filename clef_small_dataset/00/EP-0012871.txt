<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dental hand piece arrangement with a drive motor and one of the opposite handpiece handpiece, which contains a drive ie tiges and a tool side handpiece part with a gela rod portions. The handpiece manor tion further includes coolant line sections in the drive motor and in the two handpiece parts for carrying at least one coolant from the drive mood to the tool-side handpiece part and a rotary coupling between the coolant line portions of the drive motor and the adjacent handpiece part in the form of a concentrically arranged annular groove and one with this corresponding and axially or radially in these tributing or derivative channels. for reducing the mechanical and thermal load and for better protecting the parts arranged in the interior of the handpiece are sterilized, according to the shooting shaft portion (11), the coolant line portion (18) and the rotary coupling (21, 22, 24) of the drive-side handpiece part (5 ) Assigned to the drive motor (3), in the form of a coaxial to the drive shaft (9) and preferably releasably releasably arranged unit, via which a protective sleeve (29) fixedly connected to the tool-side handpiece part (6) engages. An operationally releasable locking device (30) connects the tool-side handpiece part (6) or the protective sleeve (29) connected to it (29) with the rotary part (17) of the drive-side handpiece part (5) tightly and secure against axial sliding.
