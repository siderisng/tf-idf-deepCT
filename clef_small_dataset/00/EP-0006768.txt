<ABSTRACT>
quasi-periodic pulse trains are generated and swept  in repetition frequency over an octave.  spectral harmonics  of the pulse trains which prevent the trains from having  a "flat" power spectrum over a frequency range much  greater than an octave are reduced or eliminated by ad­ justing the shape of the pulses in the trains.  by selecting  the timing of the pulses, other harmonics are reduced or  preferentially augmented.  the spectral energy of the si­ gnals which are generated during a transmission onterval  is of the type which possesses an autocorrelation function  with a narrow main lobe and low side lobe levels which is  especially suitable for echo location purposes such as in  geophysical exploration in which seismograms are cons­ tructed by cross correlation of the signals which are trans­ mitted with those which are received from geological re­ flection surfaces.
