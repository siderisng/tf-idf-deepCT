<ABSTRACT>
Frequency comparator circuit To determine if a received signal contains an expected F frequency signal and duration b.The received signal is, after clipping, used as a logical signal, to be compared to two angular rect signals F and Fq, in quadrature and frequency f.Two counters 8, 9 have respectively when AFFQ UFF = 1 and AFFQ U AFFQ = 1 and decompete again when AFFQ UFF = 1 and AFFQ UFF = 1. The passage of the counters by predetermined accounts indicates that the expected signal is received.In order to reduce the errors and to achieve a maximum account with the expected signal, an advertising device 11, 13 comprising a delay circuit 11, authorizes the operation of the counters only when A and A delayed K / F are different., with K such that application, in particular, to selectable call devices.
