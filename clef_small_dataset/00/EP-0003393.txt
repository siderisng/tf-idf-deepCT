<ABSTRACT>
a known form of secam subcarrier demodulator employs  a multi-stage limiter-amplifier (15) to supply two inputs  (l, p) to a signal multiplier (19), one input (l) being supplied  directly and the other input (p) being supplied via a phase  shifter (17) which imparts a phase shift of 90Â°c at one of the  secam subcarrier resting frequencies.  one of the amplifier  stages, preferably the final amplifier stage (15c), of the  limiter-amplifier (15) is provided according to the invention,  such as by the provision of positive feedback (via 68), with a  hysteresis characteristic ensuring development of a limiter  output having a rectangular waveshape with rise and fall  times of substantial constancy, independent of input signal  amplitude variations.  negative dc feedback (through 71)  from the penultimate amplifier stage (15b) to the input  amplifier stage (15a) of the limiter-amplifier (15) can also be  provided to assure desired symmetry of limiting action.   color difference signal output is obtained by low pass  filtering (21) of the products of multiplication of the respective  signal inputs.
