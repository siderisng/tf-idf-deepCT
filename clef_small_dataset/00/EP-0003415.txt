<ABSTRACT>
beta -lactam compounds, process for their preparation, compositions containing them and intermediates of use in their preparation are described.  the ss-lactam compounds have the formula <chem> (wherein r<2a> represents a carboxyl esterifying group or a hydrogen atom, r3 represents a group -cnh2n - where n is an integer from 1 to 6, r<1> represents an azido group -n3 or an amino group -nh2 and b represents @s or @s->o) together with salts and zwitterionic forms thereof.  the acids, salts and metabolically labile esters are of use as antibiotics or as  beta -lactamase inhibitors against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
