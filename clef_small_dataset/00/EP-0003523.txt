<ABSTRACT>
An underwater filter for aquariums has a base part (1) on which several similarly formed filter cassettes (6) are arranged one above the other. The filter cassettes (6) are substantially cuboid and have two filter chambers (68, 69) and a clear water chamber (66). The clearial water chamber (66) is located between the two filter chambers (68 and 69) and is fluidly connected to the base part (1). The lid (61 and 62) provided with bumps (610, 620) of the cuboid filter cassette (6) are removable, whereby access to the filter materials present in the filter chambers (68 and 69) is possible. In operation, the aquarium water to be filtered is sucked by means of a pump connected to the base part through the slots (610, 620) into the filter chambers (68 and 69) from there into the clear water chamber (66) and then in the base part (1) and then the Aquarium returned. To enlarge the filter capacity, a plurality of filter cassettes (6) may be arranged on a base part or a plurality of base parts (1) with filter cassettes (6) arranged thereon (6) can be interconnected.
