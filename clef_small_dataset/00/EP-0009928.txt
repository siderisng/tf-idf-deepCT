<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for monitoring edm is described in which the  voltage across the gap between an electrode and a work­ piece is passed through a filter 24 which selects those fre­ quencies which are present only during sparking across the  gap.  the voltage across the gap is also applied to a com­ parator 25 which detects discharge across the gap by deter­ mining whether the gap voltage is between two levels.  the  proportion of discharge time in which arcs occur is derived  by a time-divider circuit 32 which receives signals after pro­ cessing from the filter 24 and the comparator 25.

<DESCRIPTION>
arc monitor for electrical discharge machining the present invention relates to a monitor for electrical discharge machining (edm) and particularly for indicating the fraction of discharge time in edm in which arcs, as opposed to sparks1 occur. edm is also known as spark erosion machining. in edm, voltage pulses are applied between a shaped electrode and a workpiece spaced from the electrode, the gap between the electrode and the workpiece being positioned in a dielectric fluid. the resulting discharge erodes the workpiece to form a shape which depends upon the shape of the electrode. for good machining the discharge should be in the form of a series of sparks during each applied voltage pulse but the sparks often degenerate into arcs which instead of removing material from the workpiece burn the workpiece and the electrode. as a result both the electrode and the workpiece may become deformed by excessive burning, and excessive stresses are set up in the workpiece which may well affect its future performance, as for example in a mould for metal or plastic die casting, or in a press-tool die. when an operator is using an edm machine he needs to minimise the occurrence of arcs for the reasons given above but, at present, he does not know when arcs are occurring and he operates his machine by using characteristics supplied by the manufacturers which tend to set the machine in a way which prevents a seriously high number of arcs occurring. however by following these characteristics, optimum machining in terms of metal removal time for carrying out a machining operation, and workpiece finish, are not necessarily achieved. in edm an arc is regarded as the undesirable condition in the spark gap when the current flows through a low impedance conductive path, and a spark is regarded as the desirable form of discharge for edm. sparking is characterised by repeated application of relatively high voltage between the electrode and workpiece, subsequent electrical breakdown of the dielectric in the gap, current flow through the ionised channel, and, following switch off of the current, recovery of the dielectric fluid to its electri-cally insulating state. according to the present invention there is provided apparatus for monitoring electrical discharge machining, comprising a filter having a cut-off frequency in the range 1 mhz to 4 nhz and passing signals in at least a band of frequencies above the cut-off frequency, the filter input being adapted to receive signals representative of the voltage across the discharge gap of an electrical discharge machine, spark-indication means for generating a spark-indicating signal by determining when the output signal of the filter exceeds a reference level, and discharge-detection means, adapted to receive signals representative of the said voltage across the gap, for generating a discharge-lndication signal while a discharge occurs. the spark-indicating signal and, in some applications, the discharge indication signal may be passed to other apparatus and processed in a variety of ways for presentation, for example, to an edm machine operator to allow him to
