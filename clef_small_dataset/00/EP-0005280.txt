<ABSTRACT>
carboxylic acid halides are reduced to the corresponding  aldehydes by the use of cadmium borohydride as reducing  agent which can be prepared as a solution by mixing  a cadmium salt with an alkali metal borohydride in an  inert polar solvent.  the process enables carboxylic acid  halides to be reduced to aldehydes without the need to use  catalytic hydrogenation and the need to use very low temperatures.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
a process for the reduction of carboxylic acid halides to corresponding aldehydes and aldehydes so produced the invention relates to a process for the reduction of carboxylic acid halides to aldehydes and to aldehydes so prepared. a widely-used process for the catalytic reduction of carboxylic acid chlorides to the corresponding aldehydes is the rosenmund reduction. in this process, carboxylic acid chlorides are hydrogenated using a suitable catalyst, usually 5% palladium on barium sulphate, poisoned with a mixture of quinoline and sulphur to prevent further reduction to the alcohol. this process has the economic disadvantage that pressure equipment is required. an additional disadvantage is that certain functional groups other than the acid chloride group are reduced: for -example, nitro groups are reduced to amino groups. most hydride reducing agents reduce carboxylic acid halides to the corresponding alcohols. however, at very low temperatures, for example -80 c to -700c, lithium tri- t-butoxyaluminium hydride and sodium borohydride may be used to reduce acid halides to the corresponding aldehydes. certain complex hydrique reducing agents can be used for the reduction of specific acid chlorides to aldehydes; for example, sodium trimethoxyborohydride reduces most acid chlorides to the correspotiding alcohol, out reduces triacetylshikimic acid chloride to the carresponding aldehyde. we have now found ri method of reducing carboxylic acid halides to give the corresponding aldehyde avoiding the need to use catalytic hydrogenation reactions and the need to use very low temperatures required by known reducing agents, the present invention provides a process for the reduction of a carboxylic acid halide to the corresponding aldehyde, which comprises reacting the acid halide with cadmium borohydride as reducing agent, the reducing agent is suitably used in the form of a solution which can be conveniently obtained by mixing a solution or suspension of a cadmium salt with a solution or suspension of sodium borohydride and the term "cadmium barohydriden is employed broadly to denote the presence of cadmium ions and borohydride ions in molar ratios of substantially 1:2. the invention therefore also provides a process for the reduction of a carboxylic acid halide to the corresponding aldehyde, which comprises reacting the acid halide with a solution of cadmium borohydride in an inert polar solvent conveniently this solution may be produced in situ, preferably the acid halide is an acid bromide or an acid chloride. the reducing agent is suitably formed by mixing a cadmium salt, conveniently a cadmium halide, with an alkali metal borohydride in an inert polar solvent, and the resulting solution itself is conveniently used directly in the process of the invention the alkali metal borohydride may be lithium, sodium or potassium borohydride and is preferably potassium or sodium borohydride sodium borohydride is most preferred, the cadmium halide may be cadmium fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide and is advantageously cadmium chloride or cadmium bromide cadmium chloride is most preferred. the inert polar solvent should be capable of dissolving at least small quantities of the reactants, although complete solubility of the alkali metal borohydride and the cadmium salt
