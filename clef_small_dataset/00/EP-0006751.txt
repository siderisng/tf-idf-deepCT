<ABSTRACT>
a deflashing apparatus is disclosed having an insulated  housing (c) defining a deflashing chamber in which a  continuous belt(b) rotates for tumbling molded or die cast  articles having flash thereon.  the articles within the cham­ ber are bombarded by a high velocity stream of deflashing  media propelled into the chamber by a throwing wheel  (93).  the deflashing chamber is maintained in a cryogenic  environment which lowers the temperature of articles so that  the flash becomes brittle in comparison to the body portion  of the article and is readily removed by the impact of deflash­ ing media and the tumbling along the belt.  a gas interlock  which may be referred to as a vestibule structure (v) is  additionally disclosed which forms an effective barrier to  prevent the escape of the cryogenic gas during the insertion  and removal of articles from the chamber.  the efficiency of  the deflashing process is enhanced by novel means which  permit a variable adjustment during machine operation of  the density, intensity, and pattern of the thrown media to  ensure proper and uniform flash removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
deflashing apparatus the references to the drawings 9a and 9b are deemed to be deleted rule 43 epc. the present invention relates to the deflashing art and more particularly to cryogenic deflashing apparatus for the removal of flash in a low temperature environment wherein the flash is embrittled for easy removal by the bombardment of a high velocity pellet media stream. as is well know, numerous articles of manufacture are molded out of various elastomeric rubber or plastic materials, as well as being cast from metallic substances. by such molding and casting processes, there is often a residual material or flash formed on the articles in the area adjacent the interfacing mold surfaces, which is functionally and aesthetically objectionable. typically, the practice heretofore utilized to remove such flash was either hand trimming or abrasive tumbling. deflashing by hand is costly and oftentimes difficult, requiring a substantial period of time and labor to be expended to properly trim the particular article. furthernore, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish a satisfactory result as where part configuration prohibits manual access to the flash. similarly, although tumbling of articles in an abrasive media has proven to be a useful alternative to hand trimming, the tumbling process requires substantial machine time, and is additionally substantially limited by part configurations. as a consequence, in recent year, it has been found that highly satisfactory and economical deflashing may be accomplished by subjecting articles to a high velocity stream of deflashing media. oftentimes, the media is of steel, rubber, or plastic pelletized shot that is thrown by an impeller or projected by a nozzle against the articles which are typically tumbled in a deflashing apparatus. in the case of articles that are composed of resilient elastomers or plastic materials, it has been found advantageous to perform the deflashing operation in a cryogenic environment utilizing a liquified gas (such as nitrogen) that is implaced within the deflashing chamber. due to the relatively greater thickness of the-article compared to the flash, only the flash becomes brittle in a cryogenic environment, whereby it may be readily removed upon impact by the high velocity deflashing media without marring the remainder of the article. much of the prior art deflashing apparatus has utilized a throwing wheel or impeller which is typically supplied media through axial ports and accelerates the media along radially extending vanes to direct a media stream or pattern against the article. although such prior art impellers have proven useful in their general application, there are substantial deficiencies associated in their use. in particular, prior art throwing wheels have proven incapable of uniformly distributing the media over the desired work surfaces within the deflashing chamber with the majority of media stream being concentrated at a particular area designated in the art as a "hot spot". as will be recognized, such a hot spot prohibits the uniform deflashing of single or multiple parts within the chamber, as well as causing inconsistent wear on the internal components of the deflashing
