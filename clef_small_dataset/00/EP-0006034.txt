<ABSTRACT>
an inventive composition has fat fraction comprising  about 15-40 parts cocoa butter, about 0-25 parts butterfat,  with the sum of the parts of cocoa butter and butterfat  being not substantially in excess of about 40, and about 60-85  parts of a special confectioner's hard butter.  such hard butter  is essentially all 16-18 carbon atom triglycerides, is chemically  quite dissimilar from cocoa butter, and has an sfi profile and  melting characteristic somewhat higher than cocoa butter.   surprisingly, such hard butter can be a fine replacement fat  for cocoa butter, particularly when the composition  contains some butterfat.  a finished confectionary food  composition, typically compounded with chocolate liquor,  optional butterfat, sweetner such as sucrose, lecithin and  flavor, exhibits excellent hardness, snap and initial and  retained floss when compared to present u. s.  chocolate  counterparts.  accordingly, the composition can be used to  make chocolate-like candy, enrobings etc. , in addition to other  cocoa butter uses such as cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.   furthermore, the special hard butter can be used in  such applications also.  such special hard butter also is claimed, as well as is an  improvement in process for making same.  such improvement  involves redissolving in solvent a hard butter fraction  cropped from the systematic and successive fractional crystallization  of a fat that has a high percentage of its fat-forming  acids in the trans configuration then cropping out the preponderance  of such hard butter product as product while  retaining a small proportion of it in the mother liquor, which  proportion becomes enriched in unsaturated components.
