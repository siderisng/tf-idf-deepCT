<ABSTRACT>
a support member 3 of metallic or plastics material is  placed in a tool cavity against an imperforate blade member  1 of stainless steel, backed by a die 4 having through holes 6.   a punch 9 is impacted against the support member, which  undergoes plastic deformation and pierces the blade  member locally and is extruded through the blade into the  holes 6 to form projections which are subsequently riveted  over to secure the assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for the manufacture of razors. this invention relates to the manufacture of razors, and more particularly to a method of permanently attaching a blade member to a support. various methods have been proposed and practised, but as far as we are aware they have all involved either welding the blade member to its support or forming the support member with projections which pass through pre-formed holes in the blade member and are then rivetted over to secure the assembly. welding has the disadvantage that the heat necessarily generated alters the metallurgical structure of the blade member around the weld zone and thereby introduces the risk of corrosion of the blade member. the formation of holes in the blade member involves additional complications in manufacture of the blade member. the present invention provides a method of attachment which avoids the above stated disadvantages and which permits a wide variety of materials, metallic and non-metallic to be employed for the support member. in accordance with a feature of the invention there is provided a method of attaching a razor blade member to a support member of cold deformable material, in which the blade member has one surface contacted by a die having at least one die-hole in its blade supporting surface, and the support member is placed against the opposite surface of the blade member and is subjected, by a punch, to compressive forces sufficient to effect cold deformation of the support member, causing it to pierce and extrude through the blade member into the die-hole, the material thus extruded through the blade member subsequently being riveted over to secure the members together. the method of the invention thus avoids the risk of metallurgical degradation inherent in welding techniques. the conventionffrivetting techniques mentioned above involve the provisions of pre-formed holes in the blade member, and pre-formed projections (rivets) on the support member, which must be accurately aligned with the blade member holes and accurately controlled in their crosssection to produce a good fit in the holes. these complications are avoided by the method of the invention since the extruded projections make their own holes in the blade member. furthermore, it is possible to produce 'rivet! diameters and holes smaller than would normally be possible in the case of pre-formed holes formed by conventional mass production techniques. a method in accordance with the invention, and press tools for performing it, are described in more detail below, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:- figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a press tool; figures 2 and 3 are cross-sectional views of the blade member and support member in an intermediate and a final stage of the process; and figure 4 is a scrap perspective view of a modified press tool punch. a narrow, imperforate blade member 1 is formed by an imperforate strip of hardened stainless steel sharpened a cutting edge at 2, and is to be attached to a blade support 3 of

claims:   1. method of attaching a razor blade member to a support member of cold deformable material, characrerised in that the blade member   (1)    has one surface contacted by a die (4) having at least one die hole (6) in its blade supporting surface, and the support member (3) is placed against the opposite surface of the blade member and is subjected, by a punch (9,31) to compressive forces sufficient to effect cold deformation of the support member, causing it to pierce and extrude through the blade member into the die hole, the material (12) thus extruded through the blade member   subsequently    being riveted over (13) to secure the members together.   2. method according to claim 1, in which the die is formed with a plurality of die-holes and the support member is caused to pierce and extrude through the blade member into the respective die holes simultaneously.      3.    method according to claim 1   or2    wherein the blade member is of stainless steel.    4. method according to claim 3 wherein the blade member is   0.038    mm thick.   5. method according to claim 3 or 4 wherein the or each die hole has a diameter in the range of 0.25 mm to 0.50 mm.   6. method according to claim 3 4 or 5, wherein the support member is composed of material having a hardness of between 40 vpn and 135 vpn.   7. method according to any preceding claim, wherein the punch has one or more projecting punch portions (32)   eac       (6) aligned with a respective die-hole/and having a circular cross-section whose diameter is at least 0.05 mm larger than the respective die-hole.   8. a riveted assembly of a razor blade member and a support member when made by the method of any preceding claim.
