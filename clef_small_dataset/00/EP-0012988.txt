<ABSTRACT>
a levorotatory or dextrorotatory enantiomer of a com­ pound of the structural formula    or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein xa is  bromo or chloro; r is hydrogen, fluoro or lower alkyl, r¹ is  methyl or cyclopropylmethyl when xa is bromo, and r¹ is  cyclopropylmethyl when xa is chloro.  a process for their pre­ paration and antipsychotic compositions containing them.

<DESCRIPTION>
antipsychotic levorotatory enantiomers of 3-halocyproheptadines, analogs and derivatives background of the invention this invention is concerned with pharmaceutical compositions comprising levorotatory enantiomers of 3-halocyproheptadines and related compounds and their use as antipsychotic agents. it is also concerned with certain members of the group and their dextrorotatory counterparts which are novel compounds. racemic 3-bromocyproheptadine and 3-chlorocyproheptadine are disclosed in u.s. patent 3,014,911 as members of a large group of cyproheptadine derivatives which possess antiserotonin and antihistamine activity. they are also disclosed in j. med. chem., 8, 829 (1965). the levorotatory enantiomer of 3-chlorocyproheptadine is disclosed by ebnother et al., in helv. chim. acta, 48(6), 1237-1249 (1965). the levorotatory enantiomer of 3-iodocyproheptadine is disclosed in u.s. patent 4,031,223 and the levorotatory enantiomer of l-cyclopropylmethyl-4-(3-iodo-5h- dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)piperidine is disclosed in u.s. patent 4,031,222. now with this invention there are provided novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of these levorotatory 3-halocyproheptadines and analogs thereof as active ingredient, which are useful as antipsychotic agents. there is also provided a novel method of treating psychoses with these novel pharmaceutical compositions. there are also provided certain novel compounds within the class of 3-halocyproheptadines and analogs thereof and novel processes for synthesizing these novel compounds. detailed description of the invention the novel compounds of this invention are the levorotatory and dextrorotatory enantiomers of the compound having the following structural formula: emi2.1 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein xa represents bromo or chloro; r represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, especially c1-3 alkyl, or fluoro; rú represents methyl or cyclopropylmethyl, when is is bromo; and r1 represents cyclopropylmethyl when xa is chloro. a preferred embodiment of the novel compounds is that wherein r is hydrogen. an even more preferred embodiment of the novel compounds is that wherein r is hydrogen, and x is bromo. cl the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel compounds of this invention are acid addition salts formed from a novel compound and an organic or inorganic acid recognized by the art as providing a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, pamoate, citrate, napsylate, pyruvate, isethionate, maleate, fumarate, or the like. the salts are prepared by dissolving approximately equimolecular amounts of the free base compound and the desired acid in a solvent followed by crystallization of the salt product. the novel process for the preparation of the compounds of this invention comprises dehydration of an r-substituted l-r1-4-(3-x - cl 5-hydroxy-5h-dibenzo [a ,d] cyclohepten-5-yl) - piperidine with a dehydrating agent such as trifluoroacetic acid/trifluoroacetic anhydride at reflux temperature, as'described in j.med.chem., 8, 829 (1965), to form a racemic mixture of the novel compounds of this invention. the racemic mixture is then resolved by formation of diastereomeric salts with it and an optically active acid such as di-e-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid in a solvent such as ethanol followed by separation of the diastereomeric pair of salts such as by fractional crystallization followed by separate treatment of each salt with an alkali such as an alkali metal hydroxide, bicarbonate or carbonate, especially sodium bicarbonate or carbonate to
