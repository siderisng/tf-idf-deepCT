<ABSTRACT>
a waste container has a closing device which may be fastened axially by snap action and removed from the container's neck by rotary motion, thereby allowing the evacuation of the contents through the opening.  the closing device (10) comprises an internal cylindrical hollow extension (11, resp.  11') having on its inner wall (13) one, preferably two, guiding members (14) protruding each radially inwardly whose external edge (19), which is orientated toward the open end (18) of the internal cylindrical hollow extension (11, resp.  11'), is arcuated and extends angularly on 90`.  one, preferably two, protrusions (4, 4'), facing each other radially, are provided on the periphery of the container's neck (2) and cooperate with the guiding member (14).  the external edges (5) of protrusions (4, resp.  4'), which are orientated toward the opening (3), are arcuated and extend angularly on 900 for example.  the closing device (10) and the container's neck (2) cooperate by means of a safety catch in order to secure the device in the closing position.
