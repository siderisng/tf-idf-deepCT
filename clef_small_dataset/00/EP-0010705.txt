<ABSTRACT>
an end cap coupier system for linking one end-capp­ ed filter cartridge to another at the end cap thereof or to  another functional member is provided, comprising, in  combination:   1) first and second attaching members (1, 2), each having  first and second opposed faces;   a), a first face of each attaching member (4, 9) facing  one end of a filter cartridge or another functional  members; and   b) a second face of each attaching member (7, 12)  being adapted for closely-abutting contact with the  second face of the other attaching member;   2) an outer periphery of the second face terminating in an  outwardly extending flange (5, 12), the flange of each  member being adapted for closely-abutting contact  when the second faces of each member are in closely-­ abutting contact;   3) at least two intermeshing clamping channel members  (16, 17) having channel sides shaped to embrace the  abutting flanges of the attaching members and spaced  apart sufficiently to engage the flanges and clamp the  attaching members together; each channel member  having intermeshing locking means (25-28) engaging  mating locking means of the other member and relea­ sably locking the channel members together in such  clamping and embracing position;   whereby each of the first and second attaching members  when a part of or attached to one end cap of an end-capp­ ed filter cartridge releasably links the filter cartridge to an  end cap of another end-capped filter cartridge or to ano­ ther functional member.  modular end-capped filter cartridges are thus provid­ ed having one end cap with the first attaching member and  the other end cap with the second attaching member  adapted to be linked to corresponding members on ano­ ther end-capped filter cartridge or to another functional  member by the intermeshing clamping channel members  when embracing the flanges of the two attaching members.
