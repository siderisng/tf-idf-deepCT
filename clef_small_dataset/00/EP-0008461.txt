<ABSTRACT>
1.  a regulating device for heating or refrigeration plants comprising a heating or refrigerator means having a heating refrigerating circuit regulator, consisting of a regulating apparatus (2), at least one thermocouple (1), for example an exterior sensor, at least one energy consumption tester (4), e. g.  a thermostat or valve end switch, characterized in that, after the reference temperature that is sensed by the thermocouple (1) and is set on the regulating apparatus (2) has been exceeded, the heating or, resp. , refrigerator means (3) is cut off for a cutoff period adjusted in the regulating apparatus independently of the heating or, resp. , refrigerating circuit regulation, and in that, after termination of the cutoff time and switching-on of the energy consumption tester (4) during said cutoff period the heating or, resp. , refrigerator means (3) is released for a switched-on period that is likewise set in the regulating apparatus (2).
