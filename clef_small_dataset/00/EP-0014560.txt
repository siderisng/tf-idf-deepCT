<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for automatically folding the end closure of a  carton of rectangular cross section which includes a cover  panel (19) hinged to a rear sidewall of the carton and a pair of  flanking gusset panels (21, 23) which are each respectively  hinged to one edge of the cover panel (19) and to an adjacent  sidewall (15, 17).  the carton is continuously moved along a  conveyor path (31) with one (21) of the gussel panels leading  and the other (22) trailing.  a folding head (77) moves along a  parallel conveyor path and translates to a location adjacent  the carton.  an abutment (67) adjacent the conveyor path  contracts the leading gusset panel (21) and folds it inward  along a line (21a) at about a 45° angle to its hinged edges.  an  arm (99) mounted on the folding head (77) is caused to swing  relative to the conveyor to fold the trailing gusset panel (23)  inward along a line at about 45° angle to its hinged edges.
