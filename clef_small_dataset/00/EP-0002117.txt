<ABSTRACT>
a liquid ring vacuum pump or compressor with a long  axial dimension whose rotor blades are notched intermediate  to their ends as at (28, 30, 32) to define annular  gaps.  post members (64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74) having arcuate  inlet and outlet openings, are secured to the casing  and project inward radially towards the rotor hub into the  annular gaps.  in this way the buckets formed by the rotor blades are  filled with fluid from both axial ends of each section, thus  maintaining a high volumetric efficiency with relatively  high ratios of axial length to the diameter of the pump.
