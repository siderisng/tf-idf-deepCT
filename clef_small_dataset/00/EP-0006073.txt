<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention relates to a pulverulent-compound extractor device comprising a hopper 3 and coaxial screws 9/10 in reversed direction, driven into rotation in a cylindrical conduit 2b, which screws are separated one of the Other by the wall of a 2D coaxial tube with the screws and duct, the screw 9 of smaller rotating diameter inside the 2D tube, to convey in it the product in one direction and the one 10, larger Diameter rotating outside said 2D tube to convey the product in the opposite direction, in the delimited space between the 2D tube and the conduit 2b, it comprising at its periphery at least one orifice 15 of the flow of the product, wherein said 9/10 screws are made from spiral wound wires in the manner of a spring, and in that the 2D tube in which the screw 9 of smaller diameter is mounted, said extraction screws, comprises at its periphery and coast of the hopper 3, an opening 2D₂ of inlet of the product, before which extend at least in part said screws 9/10, which produces, after it has passed through said 2D tube is taken by the screw 10 of larger diameter and is transported in the opposite direction , and on the outside of 2D tube, on the side of the hopper 3 to exert a constant pressure at the admission, in order to avoid the vault effects above the admission opening 2D₂, and simultaneously pass the product through an orifice 15 located on the outskirts of the conduit 2b.
