<ABSTRACT>
polyphosphazene copolymers are prepared which con­ tain randomly distributed units represented by the formulas:    wherein x is a -ox(or)m-1 radical in which z is b+++, p+++,  si++++ or ti++++, m is the valence of z, r is a branched, straight  chain or cyclic alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon  atoms or mixtures thereof and wherein x′ is selected from the  group consisting of substituted and unsubstituted alkoxy,  aryloxy, amino and mercapto groups.  the alkyl groups may  vary in carbon chain length or structure within the radical as  they may all be the same.  the copolymers may contain from about 0. 1 to about 55  mole percent of the x substituent and from about 45 to about  99. 9 mole percent of the x′ substituent.  the copolymers can be utilized to form protective films  and may also be utilized in applications such as for moldings,  coatings, and the like.
