<ABSTRACT>
carbonyl-containing organic impurities are removed  from organic hydrocarbons produced in conventional  facilities.  the process comprises contacting the hydrocarbon  product with an aqueous solution containing a water soluble  reducing agent in slightly greater amount than is theoretically  required for complete reaction with the carbonyl compounds,  in an in-line mixing means, and then passing the  mixture to a phase separator to separate the layers.  the  resulting "scrubbed" hydrocarbon product is substantially  purified (e. g. , to as low as less than 2 ppm carbonyl compounds).   an optional second mixer and scrubbing tower are  provided as a back-up system in case of surge conditions or  maintenance of the first system.
