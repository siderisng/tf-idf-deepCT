<ABSTRACT>
in an electric motor for oil burners, the stator lamination stack (2) and the excitation winding (3) arranged thereon are largely surrounded with plastic (8).  for better extraction of the motor heat loss, the plastic surround (8) of the stator (1) connects an essentially hollow metal part (10), which holds the b-side bearing (6) of the rotor shaft (5) and forms the pump adaptor (9), to an a-side metal flange (11), which is used as a motor attachment to the oil burner fan, and to which, at the same time, is attached an end plate (13), which holds the a-side bearing (7) of the rotor shaft (5) and is fitted when the motor is installed.  the heat extraction can furthermore be advantageously influenced if the b-side metal part (10) and/or the a-side metal flange (11) are brought forward so far to the stator (1) that they are located in direct contact with the stator lamination stack (2).  moreover, filling material which increases the thermal conductivity of the plastic surround (8) of the stator (1) can be enclosed in it for the same purpose, and the plastic surround (8) can penetrate through rivet holes (16) provided in the stator lamination stack (2).  <image>
