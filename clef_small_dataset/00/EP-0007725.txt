<ABSTRACT>
a yarn having variable denier filaments with thick (38)  and thin (34) regions is drawn at a draw ratio selected to break  filaments in the thin regions (34).  this may be done while false-twist texturing.  the resultÂ­ ing broken ends protrude from the yarn, giving a spun-like  yarn.

<DESCRIPTION>
spun-like yarn with variable denier filaments specification the invention relates to novel processes for making from a yarn consisting of essentially continuous filaments a yarn simulating one spun from staple fibers. it is known to treat certain types of continuous filament yarns by various processes to produce yarns which simulate to some degree yarns spun from staple fibers. typical prior art processes which break the filaments so as to leave the broken ends protruding from the yarn bundle are heinrich u.s. patent 3,857,232; cardinal u.s. patent 3,857,233; and yasuzuka u.s. patent 3,967,441, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. fairley british specification 971,573 discloses a similar process wherein the broken filament ends are stated to be entangled within the yarn bundle, rather than protruding from the bundle. in each of these and other known processes wherein filaments are broken, the breakable filaments are substantially uniform from end to end. that is, there is made no provision for preferred locations of breakage along the breakable filaments, and hence, less control of breakage than might be desired. according to the present invention, this and other difficulties in the prior art are avoided by using a feed yarn having preferred locations for breakage along the breakable filaments. according to a first major aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for making a spun-like yarn comprising drawing a feed yarn, the feed yarn comprising a plurality of continuous filaments, each of this plurality of filaments having a cross-sectional arga which varies repetitively from small values in thin regions to large values in thick regions along its length, the large values being at least 25 greater than the small values, the thick and thin regions being out of phase from filament to filament along the length of the yarn, the filaments being repeatedly broken to provide broken ends primarily in the thin regions, the broken ends protruding from the bundle. according to another aspect of the invention, the yarn is false-twisted while being drawn. according to another aspect of the invention, the yarn is false-twisted and heat-set while being drawn. according to another aspect of the invention, the average distance between consecutive thick portions along each of the filaments is between 2 centimeters and 20 meters, and preferably between 20 centimeters and 5 meters. according to another aspect of the invention, the large area values are at least 3d0 greater than the small area values, and preferably are between 300% and 500% of the small area values. other aspects of the invention are in part set forth below and will in part be obvious from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: figure 1 is a vertical sectional view of the preferred embodiment of a spinneret usable to make the feed yarns according to the invention; figure 2 is a bottom plan view of the figure 1 spinneret, looking up; figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of a filament. according to certain aspects of the invention; figure
