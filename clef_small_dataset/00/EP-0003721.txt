<ABSTRACT>
Food products must first be sterilized and bleached.These two operations generally occur simultaneously by applying a quantity of heat greater than that actually necessary with the result of an alteration of the taste of the treated product.In the process of the invention, the pieces of the product to be treated are subjected in a pressure chamber at a relatively high temperature and then quickly removed and transported in an isolated chamber in which the temperature of the pieces balance without thermal exchange with theoutside.The pieces of the product are then cooled and packed sterile.
