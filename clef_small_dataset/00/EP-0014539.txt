<ABSTRACT>
compositions of matter are disclosed comprising plastic films prepared from blends of various ethylene polymers, such as polyethylene or copolymers of polyethylene, with copolymers of ethylene and propylene which have either (a) a molecular weight, as determined by their mooney viscosity at 260 deg f. , of less than about 50 and/or an ethylene content of less than about 70 %, or (b) a molecular weight, as determined by their mooney viscosity at 260 deg f. , of greater than about  50 and an ethylene content of greater than about 70 weight percent, and in which the blends have a degree of tackiness, as measured by the force required to separate a pair of films produced from these blends, of greater than about 10 millinewtons cm.  preferably, the disclosed blends utilize low density polyethylene in admixture with about 1 to 30 weight percent of the ethylene propylene copolymer, and the copolymer has a molecular weight distribution, as measured by gpc, of greater than about 10 mww/mwn.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to compositions of matter comprising blends of polyethylene and ethylene propylene copolymers. more specifically, the present invention relates to films produced from blends of polyethylene and ethylene propylene copolymers. still more specifically, the present invention relates to methods for selecting specific ethylene propylene copolymers for use in blends of polyethylene with such copolymers in order to determine the physical properties of the end product thereof. for many years attempts have been made to modify the physical properties of polyethylene and other ethylene copolymers by the addition of various materials, including ethylene propylene elastomer copolymers and the like. this has primarily been done with an eye toward the toughness and stress crack resistance of the ethylene polymer. in the case of low density polyethylene this has specifically been done in an attempt to increase the toughness of this material for use in film applications, such as garbage bags and the like, so as to increase its puncture resistance or impact strength. materials such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers have thus been employed for such purposes. as an example, in british patent no. 1,050,101, assigned to the monsanto company, the patentees disclose the improvement in the stress crack resistance of high pressure, low density, ethylene polymers with an ethylene propylene copolymer comprising up to about 107o by weight of the ethylene polymer. the ethylene polymers disclosed include not only polyethylene but also ethylene copolymers containing at least 50% by weight of ethylene. similarly, in british patent no. 924,243, assigned to farbwerke hoechst ag, the patentees disclose improvements in the properties of shaped articles comprising high density polyethylene. this patent thus discloses mixing the polyethylene prior to shaping with an amorphous copolymer of ethylene and a higher homologue, such as propylene, and also with ethylene terpolymers. canadian patent no. 642,239, assigned to phillips petroleum company, discloses yet another blend of high density polyethylene with copolymers of ethylene with higher olefins such-as propylene. again in this case the patentee discloses improving the impact strength and resistance to thermal stress cracking of the high density polyethylene thereby. in canadian patent no. 786,412, assigned to rexall drug and chemical co., improved polypropylene blends are disclosed which include mixtures of polyethylene and ethylene-propylene copolymers. in these blends, which are disclosed as being useful for film as well as other applications, the copolymer contains up to 407o ethylene, and has an intrinsic viscosity of between about 1 and 8. in addition, canadian patent no. 789,074, assigned to union carbide canada ltd., the patentees disclose improved stress crack resistant blends of polyethylene with ethylene-propylene terpolymers, such as those with small amounts of non-conjugated dienes. neither of these patents discusses the use of blends of these materials which possess surface tackiness or the like. in canadian patent 798,416 assigned to du pont of canada, ltd. blends of ethylene and rubbery ethylene-propylene copolymers are disclosed. these copolymers have mooney viscosities between about 30 and 100 and preferably between 50 and 85. it should be noted that the preferred
