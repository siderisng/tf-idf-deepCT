<ABSTRACT>
on its measuring system tee mass or power meter with a frame, a load carrier and at least one pivotally mounted lever-containing force transmission chain of the load with a load-dependent power transmission ratio in which the uninlinearity of the measuring system and at most combines with other uninlinearities from its assemblies with a The power transmission chain of nonlinear characteristic can be resolved, whereby this power transmission chain has smaller compliance than the known measuring instruments associated with great adaptability with respect to the parameters of the uninlinearity to be remedied and a lighter adjustability in terms of scattering these parameters. The mentioned lever is associated with at least one of the adjacent elements of the power transmission chain by means of one, at least partially not in the effect of the force of the force, at least athramous bending elastic connecting part, which is clamped in the lever.
