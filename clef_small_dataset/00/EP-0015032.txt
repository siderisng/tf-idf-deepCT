<ABSTRACT>
compositions for cleansing and conditioning the skin.   the compositions comprise a soap and a conditioning agent  which is a salt wherein the cation moiety is a protonated fatty  amine or a fatty quaternary ammonium ion and the anionic  moiety is the anion of a fatty acid soap or an anionic synthetic  detergent.

<DESCRIPTION>
skin clescstnn- compositions the present invention relates to improvements in soap compositions for use on the skin. the improvements reside in the formulation of soap compositions which contain certain nitrogen-based conditioning agents. these conditioning agents are salts wherein the cation moiety is a protonated fatty amine or a fatty quaternary ammonium ion and the anion moiety is the anion of a fatty acid soap or an anionic synthetic detergent. the conditioning agents are present at levels of from about 0.25% to 25% by weight in the composition. background art the most commonly used agent for cleansing the skin is soap. it has long been recognized that the cleansing of the skin with soap tends to remove natural oils from the skin, thereby causing dryness and roughness as well as a sensation of discomfort in the skin. dryness and roughness can be perceived tactually by rubbing one's fingers across the skin and will be referred to herein as "external skin feel". discomfort of the skin without touching (perceived as skin "tension" or "tightness") is felt internally by the person whose skin has been cleansed with soap and will be referred to herein as "internal skin feel". this internal feel is most readily perceived immediately after washing and drying of the skin. there have been many attempts to alleviate the adverse skin effects caused by soap, by incorporating into soap compositions a variety of mildness additives. these have included vegetable oils, mineral oils, free fatty acids, fatty acid esters of polyols, and the like. while these materials tend to alleviate the negative effects of soap upon the skin, there is a continuing need for improved skin conditioners to be used with soap. she object of the present invention is to provide soap compositions which are effective in cleansing the skin and are highly effective in alleviating the adverse effects on skin feel (especially external skin feel) which normally accompany the use of soap on the skin. disclosure of invention according to the present invention, it has been found that certain salts wherein the cation moiety is a protonated fatty amine or a fatty quaternary ammonium ion, and the anion moiety is the anion of a fatty acid soap or an anionic synthetic detergent are effective in alleviating the adverse effects on external skin feel caused by washing the skin with soap. the present invention encompasses skin cleansing compositions which comprise: a. from about 3% to about 95% by weight of a soap selected from the group consisting of alkali metal salts of fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms and mixtures of said soaps; and b. from about 0.25% to about 25% of a skin conditioning agent selected from compounds having the formulas: : emi2.1 emi3.1 therein r1 r2 r3 and r4 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of r1, r2, r3 and r4 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group
