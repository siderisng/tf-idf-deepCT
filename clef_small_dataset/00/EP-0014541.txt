<DESCRIPTION>
title: improvements in building materials conventional concrete or granolithic floor surfacings such as are used in industrial environments suffer from serious disadvantages in that they are highly susceptible to attack by materials encountered in general use in a wide range of industries. such materials as oils, greases, fats, sugar and mild acids as well as common effluents from for example breweries, paper works, food factories and dairies readily attack concrete and conventional polymer-type floors and can cause severe damage over relatively short periods. the present invention seeks to provide an improved building material. accordingly the present invention provides a building material comprising a mixture of an alumina based aggregate, cement, a multi-polymer emulsion and a lightweight aggregate or concrete sand. where the material is to be used as a floor surfacing or screed the concrete sand is used rather than a lightweight aggregate. the sand or lightweight aggregate preferably meets the specification for british standard 882 part 2: 1973 zone 4 and is for example sandford concrete sand. the lightweight aggregate is used for a wall surfacing material. while it is possible to use a sand aggregate outside the above specification the results achieved are inferior, the trowelability and composition of the material particularly being affected. the alumina based aggregate is advantageously graded with a particle size in the range 180 mesh to 6mm, the particular grading or particle size used depending on the thickness of the layering of material to be used. the mix preferably includes an anti-foam additive which may be included in the emulsion. such additives are advisable where the building material is to be machine mixed the material is suitable for use as a floor or skirting surface and may be mixed and laid by conventional means such as trowel, float or power trowel. the material may be used to form a new surface or in resurfacing or repairing damaged surfaces. he ratio of the material constituents may be varied to provide surfaces of differing strengths for example for runaways, roadways, paths and similar horizontal or sloping surfaces. a typical floor surfacing material according to the present invention comprises by weight: 1. 108 rg of chemically inert mineral processed and graded aggregate having a particle size of approximately 3mm and being a minimum 60% alumina based. 2. 75 eg sandford concrete sand meeting b-.s. 882 part 2: 1973 zone 4 (reproduced in table 1). 3. 50 kg of hydraulic high alumina cement to b.s. 915; 1972. 4. 11.5 eg of multi-polymer emulsion. table 1 sieve size bsi limits % passing 10.00 mm 100 5.00 mm 95-100 2.36 mm 9100 1.18 mm 90-100 600 u 80-100 300 u 15-50 150 u 0-15 the above material mix is sufficient to cover approximately-6.5 m2 at an average thickness of 12 mm and is a heavy duty surfacing. for lightweight purposes the alumina based aggregate particle size may be reduced. a high alumina based aggregate is essential to the invention. the aggregate is normally of 3 mm mesh size for
