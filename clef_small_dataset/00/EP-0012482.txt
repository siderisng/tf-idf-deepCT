<ABSTRACT>
a device for ejecting radar interference chuff com­ prising a magazine having a number of tubular cells (21)  in which bundles of chuff (22) may be displaced towards  an ejection opening.  a plunger device (23) and a wire (29)  which is connected thereto is used for said displacement,  in which said wire or, alternatively, a separate thread con­ nected to said wire is made to run inside the covers of said  bundles between the plunger device and the ejection open­ ing.  thereby the covers of said bundles will be ripped by  said wire or thread when passing said opening.  said maga­ zine may comprise one or a number of changeable cassettes  having each a number of cells with a belonging plunger  device and wire and also the driving elements (25, 26)  therefore, said driving elements being engaged when the  cassette is introduced.  said bundles comprise each a lon­ gitudinal recess accommodating said wire or thread.
