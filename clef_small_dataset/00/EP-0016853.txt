<ABSTRACT>
hydrocarbon feedstocks are dehydrogenated to com­ pounds having the same number of carbon atoms and a higher  degree of unsaturation by contacting the feedstock in the va­ por phase in the presence of molecular oxygen with a catalyst  consisting essentially of nickel, lead, phosphorus and com­ bined oxygen, and optionally, an alkali metal.  representative of  such conversions is the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane  to butenes and butadiene.

<DESCRIPTION>
dehydrogenation process and catalyst thermal non-catalytic and catalytic processes for converting organic compounds to compounds having a higher degree of unsaturation are known. the former are characterized by undesirable side reactions, low order of conversion and yields and poor selectivity to desired product. the catalytic processes nre characterized by the particular catalytic material employed and the conditions unde which the processes are operated, e.g., in the absence or presence of oxygen. while a number of such catalytic processes have attained some mensure of commercial success, there is continuing search for better catalytic materials which exhibit the high activity, high yield to desired product, hiah selectivity to desired product, extended longevity, which can be readily rngenerated to an activity approaching that of fresh catalyst, and which keep undesirable side reactions to a mininum; all characteristics of good dehydro genation catalysts. the vexatious problem constantly faced hy those skilled in the art is the identification and characterization of the compositions which are hip,hly efficient dehydrog,enation catalysts. among the more recently disclosed dehydrogenation catalysts are those which include halogens or halogen-releasing materials. such catalysts hate exhibited so many disadvantages in regard to equipment corrosion and the additional expense of continuously feeding, recovering and recycling the relatively expensive halogen materials that economically practical, large-scale use of such catalytic materials has been precluded. halogen-free catalytic materials continue to be the most desirable for use in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. it is an object of this invention to provide a catalyst composition which has a highly effective catalytic activity. it is another object of this invention to provide a process for the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon materials. other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description of this invention which follows and the appended claims. in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a novel catalyst and a novel process for the conversion oe hydrocarbon feedstocks to hydrocarbons having a greater degree of unsaturation and which have the same or layer number of carbon atoms as the hydrocarbon feed. according to this invention, hydrocarbon feedstocks can be converted directly to hydrocarbons having a greater degree of unsaturation by contacting such feedatocks under dehydrogenation conditions in the vapor phase in the presence of molecular oxygen with a catalytic material consisting essentially of nickel, lead, phosphorus and combined oxygen, and optionally, an alkali netalo thus, paraffinic hydrocarbons can be converted in good yields to diolefins andzor mono olefines, and monoolefins can be converted to diolef ins. t1s invention is particularly applicable for the production of diolefins from paraffins, and particularly useful results are obtained by the dehydrogenation of butane to butenes and butadiene, and butenes to butadiene. the hydrocarbon feedstocks which are applicable for the oxidative dehydrogenation processes of the present invention comprise dehydrogenatable aliphatic hydrocarbons having from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms per molecule and at least one emi3.1 grouping. these can be branched or unbranched and include paraffins as well as monoolefins, but the
