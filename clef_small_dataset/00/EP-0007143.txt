<ABSTRACT>
moving bed hydride heat pumps and pressure pumps are  described in which a hydride-forming material is transported  between two or more reactor vessels (21,23).  each vessel can  be maintained at a predetermined temperature, and thus, the  hydride-forming material may be heated or cooled by moving  it into an appropriately heated or cooled reactor vessel  (21,23).  in this way thermal cycling of reactor vessels is  reduced or eliminated.  both continuously operating and movÂ­ ing batch hydride pumping systems are disclosed.
