<ABSTRACT>
the aim of the present invention is to make it possible to  synchronize a digital memory (8) with an existing tv-system,  in which a tv-picture is transmitted with video interlace.   according to the invention a corrected field synchronizing  pulse (b2) is formed by means of a composite sync signal (s)  of the tv-system, which pulse (b2), in spite of the video  interlace, always appears at the starting point of a line and by  means of which a part in an address counter (6) for the  memory associated with vertical addressing of the memory  is reset to a starting position at the starting point of each  picture field.  the address counter is stepped for addressing  purposes by means of a clock signal from a main oscillator  (5), the frequency of which is controlled in response to a  comparison between a line synchronizing signal (l1) derived  from the composite sync signal and line frequency signals  (l2, l3) supplied from the address counter.
