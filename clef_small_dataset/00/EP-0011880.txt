<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle guidance system is a dependable means of  guiding the vehicle from any point to any other destination  desired by the operator.  the punch card that contains the  distance and instructions can be programed either by the  individual concerned or a vgs office.  an up down counter  continiously displays the difference betwee distance prog­ ramed and the distance covered.  when such a difference is  zero the driver is expected to execute the instruction flashed.  if  however instructions are not followed a system has been  integrated to inform the driver same and issue new instruc­ tions to correct the error committed.  after each execution of the instruction the step up relay is  energized to bring the next program in line and resets all  protecting and correcting circuits.  the first 20 bits in the  character realization circuit represent programed distance  and the last 4 represent instructions and directions.  the dis­ play shows a zero when the programed distance and the  covered distance for the instruction in that specific index is  equal.

<DESCRIPTION>
a vehicle guidance system the invention relates to a system that gives instruction of directions with the effect that a driver is enabled to manuvere the vehicle from one point to any other desired destinaeven though he had no previous knowledge of the route. the system is digital and operates at a low current the source of which is the vehicle's battery. the only other connection to the vehicle is the distance counter. the vehicle as we know it today has come a long way in releiving the driver from stress and make him as confertable as possible during his journey. the one main factor remaining is that he has still to find his way about and some times under difficult conditions. in cases where he is in an area of which he has no prior knowledge his difficulties increase. the cost in terms of stress time and money becomes high. the system is purpose made to eliviate all such difficulties encountered in travelling from one place to another. it eliminates unnecessary apperhansions, costly errorsand harmful frustations. the invention has got numerous advantages. it contributes towards a safe traffie system by directing the driver to be in correct lane for correct turning, and inchurage more and more people to take alternative routes instead of converging to the centre of a town on a city. it can be programmed to avoid one way streets, diversions and congested areas most of all it helps the driver by doing most to the thinking in guiding the vehicle towards the desired destination. figure i is the block diagram of the complete system. the card memory register (cmr) is the read in for the programed punch card. the character realisation circuit registers in a binary form the exact distance to be converd and the directions accompanying the instruction. this value thus registered becomes the starting point for the up and down counter. when the vehicle is in motion it generates a pulse for each actual one meter distance covered. this pulse is used as the clock input of the up and down counter. the difference of distance programed and distance covered is contini- ously displayed on the (dcd) difference distance display. arrangments has been made to switch through instructions and directions when the dcd displays 200 meters. instructions are 'keep' and 'turn'. directions are 'left', 'right', 'middle lane' and 'u'. all of them are analysed by the instruction and direction unit (iad) and then passed to the system control unit (scu). the (scu) checks if driver has followed the instruction and if this is found to be positive triggers the step up relay (sur) which in turn rotates the card thereby bringing the @ @@@ program in line with the road in circuitry. if however instruction has not been carried out accordingly the system realizes the error and instructs a 'u' turn to be taken in order to bring the vehicle back to the point where at first error occured. it then issues the correct

claims:   i. a vehicle guidance system in anyway similar to the one described here making use of the system control unit (scu) and associated circuitry.   2. an assembly as claimed in claim i, where a digital system is used towards the purpose of achiving the same purpose; that of guiding the vehicle from point 'a' to point 'b'.
