<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to alkylborane complexes with  aromatic amines of the formula:-    in which r¹ and r² are the same or different (1-4c)-­ alkyl radicals, or together with the adjacent nitrogen atom  are morpholino, piperidino or pyrrolidino radicals; r³ and  r⁴ are independently selected from hydrogen, (1-4c)-­ alkyl, (1-4c)-alkoxy, di-(1-4c)-alkylamino, morpholino,  piperidino and pyrrolidino; thexyl stands for 1,1,2-tri­ methylpropyl; and n is the integer 1 when r³ and r⁴ are  other than nitrogen containing radicals, or the integer 1 or  2 when one of r³ and r⁴ is a nitrogen containing radical,  or the integer 1, 2 or 3 when both r³ and r⁴ are nitrogen  containing radicals.  the complexes are more stable than thexylborane  tetrahydrofuran complex, but are sufficiently reactive to  be valuable as hydroborating and reducing agents.  the invention also provides solutions of the  complexes of formula i in organic solvents for convenient  storage or subsequent synthetic use, and a process for  manufacturing said complexes.  a particularly convenient complex of the invention  is thexylborane n,n-diethylaniline complex.
