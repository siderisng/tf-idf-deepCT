<ABSTRACT>
a flexible conveyor track, for use with a conveyor belt (12)  adapted to follow a curved path, has segmented track portions  (25,26,28,29) defining an elongate central area.  in order  to provide controlled bending of the track, positive lateral  support to resist tipping and reduced noise, the track includes  articulated links (33) along the central area with each link  joined to a segment (32â€²) of each track portion.  the segments  (323) of upper and lower tracks (25,28:26,29) are connected  together by weldments (76,77) and resilient guide rods (80)  pass through the weldments (76,77) and are retained at each  end in union plates (60,70) fastened to the lengths of track  adjoining the flexible assembly.
