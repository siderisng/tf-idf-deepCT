<ABSTRACT>
a method of ultrasonic testing of a weld (c) between a pipe (2) and a plug (4) to obturate the pipe.  this method is characterised in that it consists: on the one hand in forming in the outer wall of the plug (4) a circular depression having an annular surface (8") and a cylindrical surface (8') respectively intended to be in contact with one of the end edges of the pipe (2) and the portion of the inner wall of the said pipe adjacent to the said end edge of the pipe and, on the other hand, in forming in the said plug (4) a cavity (12) opening out at one of its ends and extending from this end beyond the said annular surface (8") and, after having made the weld between the said annular surface and the said end edge of the pipe (2), in the ultrasonic testing of the depth of the weld (c) in the vicinity of the said annular surface.  application to the ultrasonic testing of a weld (c) between a pipe (2) and a plug (4) to obturate the latter.  <image>
