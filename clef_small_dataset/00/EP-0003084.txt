<DESCRIPTION>
title spirobenzofuranone compounds this invention relates to spiro compounds having a novel skeletal structure, which are of use as medicines and as intermediates for the production of medicines. the invention also relates to methods of producing these novel spiro compounds. more particularly, this invention relates to novel sniro compounds of the formula: emi1.1 wherein ring a represents a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring, the ring being unsubstituted or substituted by at least one of lower alkyl, nitro, halogen, amino, which may optionally itself be substituted, hydroxyl which may optionally itself be substituted, acyl and sulphamoyl, and to methods of producing these novel spiro compounds. the optional substituents of ring a (as defined above) are now described in detail. examples of the lower alkyl group include alkyl grips of 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl, tert.-butyl, n-pentyl, iso-pentyl, n-hexyl, 2-methylpentyl or 2-ethylbutyl). the halogen may be chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine. examples of the amino group, which may optionally be substituted, include amino, mono- or di-alkylamino, acylamino, sulphonylamino and cycloamino. the monoor dialkylamino group may be amino which is monoor di-substituted by alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as e.g., methylamino, ethylamino, npropylamino, iso-propylamino, n-butylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, di-n-propylamino or methylethylamino. the acylamino group may, for example, be alkanoylamino containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g. acetylamino, propionylamino, n-butyrylamino or iso-butyrylamino). the sulphonylamino group may, for example, be alkanesulphonylamino containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g. methanesulphonylamino or ethanesulphonylamino). as the cycloamino group, there may be mentioned 5or 6-membered cycloamino groups which may contain n or 0, for example, pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, piperazinyl or morpholino. the piperazinyl group may have a substitutent at the nitrogen atom of its 4-position, such as an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g. methyl or ethyl), a phenyl-cl 4 alkyl group (e.g. benzyl) or an alkanoyl group containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g. acetyl or propionyl). as examples of the hydroxyl group which may optionally be substituted, there may be mentioned hydroxyl, alkoxy, aralkyloxy or acyloxy. the alkoxy group preferably contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, iso-propoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec.-butoxy- or tert.-butoxy), and the alkoxy group may be further substituted, for example, by monoor di alkylamino groups (e.g. methylamino, ethylamino, dimethylamino or diethylamino). the aralkyloxy group may, for example, be a phenyl-cl 4 alkyloxy group (e.g. benzyloxy or phenethyloxy). the acyloxy group is preferably an alkanoyloxy group containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g. acetyloxy, propionyloxy, n-butyryloxy or iso-butyryloxy), or benzoyloxy group, for instance. the acryl groups may, for example, be an alkanoyl group of 2 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g. acetyl, propionyl, n butyl3;1 or iso-butyryl) or benzoyl. the substituents of ring a (up to 4 at a maximum) may be present in various substitutable positions on ring a, and may be the same or different. when a is benzine, the a ring is preferably substituted at its 5- or 6-position (the 5-position is the more desirable), by
