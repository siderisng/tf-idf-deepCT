<ABSTRACT>
the lamp device comprises a sealed beam lamp (1,3,5)  mounted in a casing (7) designed as a pressure vessel, so  that the lens part (1) of the sealed beam lamp constitutes part  of the pressure vessel wall in the form of a pressure vessel lid  and so that the back side (5) of the sealed beam lamp having  the electrical connecing means of sealed beam lamp is  within a water-tight pressure chamber.  the pressure vessel  casing bears against the back side of the circumferential  flange (3) of the sealed beam lamp, a ring sealing means (23)  placed in a groove in the casing being arranged therebe­ tween.  the flange (3) is applied against the casing (7) by  means of a ring plate (19) bearing against the front side of  the flange via a pressure balacing packing (27), the ring plate  being releasably tightened to the casing.  the pressure  chamber has such dimensions that a considerable free space  is obtained around the back side (5) of the sealed beam lamp,  so that thermal self-convection transferring generated lamp  heat to the water-cooled walls of the casing is obtained.   according to a preferred embodiment, connection leads (28,  29) brought through the pressure vessel wall in a pressure  and watar-tight manner, are drawn along the inner side of  the wall to a connector (31) from where heat-resistant leads  (37,39) are drawn to the electrical connecting means of the  sealed beam lamp.  the lamp device means that the weak side of the sealed  beam lamp is completely protected, that a very good cooling  is obtained without any particular cooling arrangement, such  as cooling flanges, and that both the sealed beam lamp and  connecting leads can be replaced easily.  in a particular deep water embodiment, a pressure  absorbing chamber filled with a liquid is arranged in front of  the lens part of the sealed beam lamp.
