<ABSTRACT>
an improved microwave energy moderating bag for enclosing, for instance, foodstuff such as a beef roast to be cooked at relatively high power in a microwave oven so that the foodstuff can be uniformly cooked to a predetermined degree of doneness without being repositioned and without having to vary the power level during the cooking interval.  the improved bag is of the type fabricated from a laminated sheet comprising two laminae of thermoplastic films and a perforated foil lamina of microwave reflective material such as, for example, aluminum foil.  the improved bag comprises an improved pouch-type closure and duplex side seams.  both static and dynamic embodiments of the invention are disclosed: a static embodiment being dimensionally stable as opposed to a dynamic embodiment which is heat shrinkable by virtue of comprising a heat shrinkable thermoplastic film.  such a dynamic embodiment is so constructed that it transitions from being substantially transparent to microwave energy to being substantially less transparent to microwave energy as its temperature is increased: for instance, during a cooking cycle in a microwave oven.
