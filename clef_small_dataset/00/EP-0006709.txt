<ABSTRACT>
a closure for a dispenser-container for moist tissues  or the like which minimises evaporation of the tissues sto­ red in a continous lenght in the container.  the closure  comprises two superimposed diaphragms (6, 13) each hav­ ing an opening (11, 16) therein completely out of register  with the other, at least one of the openings being resilient­ ly sealed by the other diaphragm.  the tissue is drawn from  the container through the two openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
closure for a dispenser container this invention relates to a closure for containers for storing and dispensing moist tissues or the like and more particularly to a container closure adapted to maintain the tissues in the container in a moist condition over a long period. the tissues are stored in the container in continuous rolled or folded length suitably perforated at spaced transverse lines to provide separable tissues of appropriate size. such containers are referred to as dispenser-containers hereinafter. generally disenser-containers have included an opening in one wall of the container in the form of a straight or cross shaped slit through which tissues may be drawn. a problem with these prior art dispenser containers 'is that a portion of tissue to be next extracted necessarily protrudes through the slit opening and sometimes separates the edges of the slit to a considerable extent. this separation allows some escape of the evaporable fluids with which the tissue is impregnated in its moist state. an object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a closure for a dispenser-container that reduces direct escape to atmosphere of the evaporable moistening fluids by comparison with conventional slit wall containers. the invention provides a closure for a dispensercontainer mouth comprising an inner and outer diaphragm each with an opening therethroughcompletely out of register with other, the opening in at least one of the diaphragms being resiliently sealed by the other diaphragm. thus in what is probably the simplest form of the invention the closure comprises two resilient diaphragms lying flatly one against the other and each pierced by an opening such that the two openings are completely out of register,each of the diaphragms resiliently sealing the hole in the other diaphragm. in such instance if a tissue is to be removed from the container it must pass through one opening and then between the two diaphragms across a zone of contact to the other opening and through that opening to the exterior of the container. the passage of the tissue from one opening to the other across the zone of contact is of course permitted as a result of resilient flexure or deformation of the diaphragms. instead of the entire areas of the diaphragms contacting one another the diaphragms can contact each other at least over a continuous contact zone which surrounds the opening in only one of the diaphragms. such a contact zone seals one opening from the other and can be provided for example by a rib or protrusion surrounding the opening. providing a contact zone surrounding the opening in both of the diaphragms can increase the seal between the openings. conveniently the contact zone rims the opening in a diaphragm. a frustoconical wall portion can extend from a diaphragm to terminate in a free end forming the opening in the diaphragm. the frustoconical wall portion can be in the outer diaphragm, the frustum providing a recess in the top of the diaphragm in which the free end of the next extracted tissue

   claims      1. a closure for a dispenser-container mouth characterised in that the closure comprises an inner and outer diaphragm   each    with an opening therethrough completely out of register with each other, the opening in at least one of the   diaphragms    being resiliently sealed by the other diaphragm.   2. a closure according to claim 1 characterised in that the diaphragms contact each other at least over a continuous contact zone which surrounds the opening in only one of the diaphragms.   3. a closure according to claim 2 characterised in that a contact zone surrounds the opening in each diaphragm.   4. a closure according to claim 2 or claim 3 characterised in that the contact zone rims the opening in the diaphragm.   5. a closure according to claim 4 characterised in that a frustoconical wall portion extends from a diaphragm to terminate in a free end forming the opening in the diaphragm.   6. a closure according to claim 5 characterised in that the outer diaphragm is provided with a frustoconical wall portion.   7. a closure according to claim 5 or claim 6 characterised in that the frustoconical wall portion of the diaphragm is resilient.      8. a closure according to any one of claims 5 to 7 characterised in that the frustoconical wall portion is part of an oblique cone.   9. a closure according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the opening in a diaphragm is provided with an edge flange.   10. a closure according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the inner diaphragm is adapted to snap engage the mouth of the container and the outer diaphragm is snap engaged with the inner diaphragm.   11. a closure according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that there is provided an external snap fitting cap.   12. a closure for a dispenser container substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.   13. a dispenser container characterised in that it has a cloture according to any one of the preceding claims.
