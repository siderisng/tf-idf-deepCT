<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for the automatic stacking of metal sheets to form laminated iron cores for tansformers and choke coils, having supply stores (4) for sheet metal banks (11) with horizontally displaceable stack stores (5), with a conveying carriage (8) which may travel horizontally over the stores and to which lifting devices, which may be switched on and off, are fitted, with drives for the transport of the conveying carriage (8) and for rainsing and lowering the lifting devices, characterized in that the number of the supply stores (3, 4) corresponds to the number of sheet metal blanks (11) to be stacked ; in that the supply sotres (3, 4) are disposed one behind the other in at least one row ; in that the stack stores (5) are disposed one behind the other on an endless conveyor belt (6) which is adjacent to the row of supply stores (4) and runs parallel thereto ; in that the number of the stack sotres (5) - one the conveyer belt (6) - ready for receiving corresponds at least to the number of supply stores (4) of the row ; and in that a drive (7) is provided for the conveyer belt and operates in strokes.
