<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for harvesting material from micro-culture  plates comprises either a harvester plate 2 or, in combi­ nation a harvester plate 2 and a micro-culture plate 1,  the harvester plate having a plurality of wells 13 recessed  into one surface thereof, these wells conforming in size,  number and arrangement to the wells 5 of the micro-culture  plate, and the wells of the harvester plate being adapted  to hold filter elements for absorbing liquid from corre­ sponding wells of the culture plate when the wells of the  culture plate, with the culture plate in an upside-down  orientation, are contacted with corresponding wells of  the harvester plate, and in which the harvester plate wells  have fluid outlets 16 at their bases.  also a new micro-­ culture plate 1 comprises a plurality of wells 5 recessed  into a surface thereof each well comprising a fluid inlet  passageway 7 through the base thereof.  additionally a  new method of harvesting material from a micro-culture  plate comprises harvesting material from the wells of the  micro-culture plate when the plate is maintained in an  upside-down orientation, the material being transferred  directly to absorbent elements such as filter paper discs.
