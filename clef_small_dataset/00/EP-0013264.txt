<ABSTRACT>
a hose-break valve comprises a valve housing (2) and a  sliding gate (1) movable therealong and is connected with a  pressure hose (5) which is surrounded by a protective sleeve  (14), while defining a space (13) filled with a pressure medium.   the sliding gate (1) is under the action of, on the one hand, the  pressure medium in said space (13) and, on the other hand, a  loading device (17) acting opposite the pressure medium.   first and second pressure relieving devices (19 and 80-82,  respectively) are provided for closing the valve by means of  the loading device (17) when the pressure of the pressure  medium in said space (13) respectively exceeds an upper limit  value and falls short of a lower limit value.

<DESCRIPTION>
hose-break valve this invention relates to a hose-break valve for pressure hoses or conduits with a surrounding protective hose or conduit and a pressure medium in a space between the pressure and protective hoses or conduits, said valve having a sliding gate which is movable along a valve housing between an open position and a closed position preventing throughflow through the valve and which is adapted to be actuated by said pressure medium to be held thereby in the open position against the action of a loading device yieldably actuating the sliding gate towards the open position and adapted to close the valve when the pressure of said pressure medium falls short of a lower limit value, so that the valve will prevent backs low of gas or liquid from an appliance located downstream of the valve upon leakage or break upstream of said valve. a known hose-break valve of this type is described in the published swedish patent application 7702568-0 and comprises a movable or displaceable sliding gate which is actuated not only by the pressure medium enclosed between the pressure conduit and the protective sleeve thereof, but also by a spring pressure opposed to the pressure of the pressure medium, the said two pressures maintaining the sliding gate in a position permitting liquid to pass through the valve when the said pressures counterbalance each other, i.e. when they are equal, but displacing the sliding gate in one or the other direction to close the liquid flow through the valve when one or the other pressure exceeds the opposed pressure, for instance upon break of the pressure conduit and/or its protective sleeve. the function of these known hose-break valves is satisfactory, except when pressure surges occur in the pressure conduit or in the pressure medium within the protective sleeve, and when a small leakage occurs in the pressure conduit or in the sleeve, thus, it was found that such pressure surges upset the spring-balanced position of the sliding gate, and furthermvrt the effects of the pressure surges are aggravated because the sliding gate is moved out of the balanced open position and partially closes the throughflow through the valve. a small leakage in the pressure conduit or in the sleeve will cause the balanced position of the sliding gate to be displaced in one or the other direction from the open position of the valve, resulting in a partial throttling which may remain over a long period of time until so much pressure medium has leaked out that the valve will be fully closed. such long-term throttling of the flow through the valve may result in considerable loss of power. the present invention therefore has for its object to obviate these shortcomings of the prior art hose-break valves operating with a pressure medium to actuate a sliding gate included in the valve. to achieve this object, the hose-break valve of the present invention is characterized by the features stated in the appended claims. the invention will be described in

<CLAIMS>
   claims       1. a hose-break valve for pressure hoses or conduits (5) with a surrounding protective hose or conduit (14) and a pressure medium in a space (13) between the pressure and protective hoses or conduits, said valve having a sliding gate (1) which is movable along a valve housing (2) between an open position and a closed position preventing throughflow through the valve and which is adapted to be actuated   bf    said pressure medium to be held thereby in the open position against the action of a loading device (17, 55) yieldably actuating the sliding gate (1) towards the open position and adapted to close the valve when the pressure of said pressure medium falls short of a lower limit value, characterised in that it is has a pressure relieving device (19) communicating with said space (13) and adapted,  when the pressure of the pressure medium in said space exceeds an upper limit value, to relieve the pressure, thereby closing the valve under the action of the loading device (17,55).    2. a hose-break valve as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that it has a second pressure relieving device (18; 80-82) which is adapted, when the pressure of the pressure medium in said space (13) falls short of a lower limit value, to relieve this pressure and thereby to cause the loading device (17, 55) to move the sliding gate (1) to closed position.    3. a hose-break valve as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the second pressure relieving device (8082) comprises a pressure relieving duct (80) formed in the sliding gate (1) and having its outlet (81) in the sliding gate side facing the valve housing (2), the outlet (81) of said pressure relieving duct (80) being separated from said space (13) in the open position of the valve by means of a seal (82) which is provided on the valve housing (2) in a position determined by the lower  limit value of the pressure medium so that, when the pressure of said pressure medium falls short of said lower limit value, communication is established between the presure relieving duct (80) and the said space (13).    4. a hose-break valve as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the pressure relieving device (19) comprises a portion (18) which is actuated by the pressure medium and constitutes a weak point in that it has been dimensioned to rupture when the pressure of the pressure medium exceeds the upper limit value, thereby to relieve the pressure within said space (13).    5. a hose-break device as claimed in claim 1 or 4, characterised in that the pressure relieving device (19) comprises a puncturing means (24, 26) which is adapted to be actuated by relative movement between the sliding gate (1) and the valve housing (2) and to puncture a closing member (18) included in the pressure relieving device (19) when the pressure of the pressure medium falls short of the lower limit value.     6. a hose-break valve as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the puncturing means (24, 26) is provided on the sliding gate (1) and has a cam follower (26) adapted to engage a cam surface (29) formed on the valve housing (2).    7. a hose-break valve as claimed in claim 4, 5 or 6, characterised in that said portion (18) actuated by the pressure medium is a diaphragm (18).    8. a hose-break valve as claimed in any one of claims 1-7, characterised in that it comprises a sliding gate returning device (72-75) acting between the sliding gate (1) and the valve housing (2), to permit manual return of the sliding gate from its closed position into an at least partically open position against the action of the loading device   (17)
