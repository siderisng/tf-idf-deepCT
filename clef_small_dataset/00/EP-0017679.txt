<ABSTRACT>
2-aminopyrimidones which are histamine h₂- antago­ nists having the structure    in which het² is an optionally substituted 4-imidazolyl,  2-pyridyl or a 2-thiazolyl group; y is sulphur or methylene;  z is hydrogen or lower alkyl; a is c₁-c₅ alkylene; r is lower  alkyl or lower alkoxy; and r¹ is hydrogen, lower alkyl or  lower alkoxy, are prepared by a process in which an amine  het²-ch₂y(ch₂)₂nh₂ is reacted with a compound of  structure    in which q is nitroamino, lower alkylthio, benzylthio, chlo­ rine, bromine or other group which can be displaced with  a primary amine.

<DESCRIPTION>
pyridylalkylpyrimidone compounds, process for preparing them and pharmaceutical compositions containing them this invention relates to pharmacologically active pyridylalkylpyrimidone compounds, to a process for preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. in german offenlegungsschrift 2658267 a group of pyrimidones (1) are described as having histamine h1- and h2- antagonist activity. emi1.1 in structure(l)het is a 2- or 4- imidazolyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, halogen, trifluoromethyl or hydroxymethyl, a 2-pyridyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, amino or hydroxy, a 2-thiazolyl group, a 3-isothiazolyl group optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, a 3-(1,2,5)- thiadiazolyl group optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, or a 2-(5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazolyl) group: y is sulphur or methylene; z is hydrogen or lower alkyl; x is oxygen or sulphur; w is methylene, oxygen or sulphur; the sum of p and q is 1 to 4, or, when w is methylene, 0 to 4; and hetl is a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle such as pyridine, furan, thiophene, thiazole, oxazole, isothiazole, imidazole, pyrimidine, pyrazine or pyridazine, which heterocycle is optionally substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or can have a benzene ring or substituted benzene ring fused to it. one class of compounds described is that in which retl is a 2-furyl, 2-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-thiazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 2pyrazinyl or 3-pyridazyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy. we have found that a small group of compounds of the general class have improved therapeutic properties, and are less acutely toxic than other members of the general class. according to the invention there is provided a pyrimidone of structure (2) emi2.1 in which ret is a 4-imidazolyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, halogen or trifluoromethyl, a 2-pyridyl group optionally substituted by one or more lower alkyl or lower alkoxy groups or halogen atoms, or a 2-thiazolyl group: y is sulphur or methylene; z is hydrogen or lower alkyl; a is c1-c5 alkylene: r is lower alkyl or lower alkoxy; and r1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy. throughout this specification by the terms 'lower alkyl' 2nd 'lower alkoxy' are meant alkyl and alkoxy groups which can be straight or branched and which contain from 1 two 4 carbon atoms. particular lower alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, 1propyl and 2-propyl. particular lower alkoxy groups are methoxy, ethoxy, l-propoxy and 2-propoxy. the compounds of structure(2)have particularly good histamine h1- and h2- antagonist activity and are less acutely toxic in mice (when administered intravenously) than the corresponding compounds of structure(2)in which r is hydrogen. this decrease in acute toxicity is in general not accompanied by a reduction in histamine h1antagonist activity or histamine h2-antagonist activity. for example the six specific compounds of structure 1: 2-[4-(3-methoxy-2-pyridyl)butylamino ]-5-(6-methyl-3- pyridylmethyl)-4-pyrimidone, 2-[4-(3-chloro-2-pyridyl)butylamino]-5-(6-methyl-3- pyridylmethyl)-4-pyrimidone, 2-[2-(5-methyl-4-imidazolylmethylthio)ethylamino]- 5- (6-methyl-3-pyridylmethyl) -4-pyrimidone, 2-[2-(5-methy1-4-imidazoly1methylthio)ethylaminoj5 (6-methoxy-3-pyridylmethyl) -4-pyrimidone, 2- [2- (2-thiazolylmethylthio)ethylamino i-s- (6-methyl- 3-pyridylmethyl)-4-pyrimidone,and 2-[2-(3-bromo-2-pyridylmethylthio)ethylamino]-5-(5,6- dimethyl-3-pyridylmethyl)-4-pyrimidone, when compared with the corresponding 5-(3-pyridylmethyl) analogues which lack the 6-substituent (or 5- and 6substituents)in the pyridyl group are approximately of equal potency as histamine h1-antagonists and histamine h2antagonists, but
