<ABSTRACT>
access apparatus including an upper boom (4) (5) and a  second boom (3) pivotally interconnected therewith, a plat­ form (6) attached to the free end of the upper boom (4) (5)  and first ladder means (15) (16) arranged on the upper sur­ face of the upper boom (4) (5) to provide access from the  platform (6) along at least a part of the upper surface of the  upper boom (4) (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
"access apparatus having a plurality of booms" this invention relates to access apparatus having a plurality of booms, the booms being pivotally connected to one another in such a way that they can be folded down on top of one another for transport on a vehicle to which the lowermost of the booms is commonly pivotally and rotatably connected. at the free end of the uppermost boom, there is commonly provided a platform which is maintained level during use and which is generally used to carry one or more persons. in order to provide a means of descent from the platform in situations in which it is not possible to lower the platform in the normal way, it has been proposed in u.k. patent specification no. 1, 248,611 to provide a ladder which extends dowiiwardly along side and parallel with at least the uppermost boom from the platform or cage adjacent the end thereof, the ladder being extensible from the said position into contact with the ground or other convenient surface which provides a landing area. in u.k. patent no. 1,347,301, it has been proposed to provide on such apparatus at least one ladder which is hingedly connected along one of its side edges to a lower side edge of an associated booln for movement between an operative position wherein it extends outwardly from the boom and a stowed position wherein it is juxtaposed with a side wall of the b where there are two or more arises in descending from the platfo difficult to transfer from the ladde one boom to the ladder associated wi solution to this problem is proposed specification no. 1,337,154 in which that ladders are arranged on opposit of a pair of adjacent booms and that at the joint between the booms, the between the two ladders so as to pro able means for a person to pass from other. the provision of ladders alor booms is cumbersome and it is not eaf ladder associated with the upper boom the present invention provides which the upper boom has a ladder means tread, along its upper surface from a adjacent end thereof. purthermore it provide a handrail that is permanentl course, if it is preferred, the handr connected to the upper boom in such a down on top of the boom when it is no in arrangements having a tele ible upper boom, it is possible to pr extension with ladder means, for example a tread, and to provide a handrail which extends from the platform and moves with the extendible boom sliding alongside the handrail provided on the main part of the upper boom during the retraction of the extensible portion. it will be appreciated that the tread can be formed in the upper surface of the upper boom or be applied to the upper boom and its extensible portion. it could be in the form of rungs, as in a ladder, and the rungs of the portion corresponding to the extensible boom could form

claims:   1. access apparatus including an upper boom (4), (5), a platform (6) attached to one end of the upper boom, a pivotal connection (9) between the upper boom (4) (5) and a second boom (3) to enable relative angular movement to take place between the booms in the vertical plane and first ladder means (21) extending from the region of the pivotal connection (9) to a landing area, the apparatus further including second ladder means (15) (16) extending along at least a part of the upper face of upper boom (4) (5) from the platform-adjacent end thereof.   2. access apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the upper boom is constituted by a boom portion (5) which is extensible relative to the main boom portion (4) and the second ladder means includes a first ladder section (16) which is movable longitudinally with the boom portion (5).   3. access apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein the first ladder section (36) has a first part pivoted (37) about a second part.   4. access apparatus as claimed in any one of   the    preceding claims having second ladder means (63) (64) and  means (65) to raise the second ladder means (63) (64) from the upper face of the upper boom (58) when in use.   5. access apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims including a handrail (52) pivotally attached to a ladder means 47 whereby the handrail (52) can be folded down through a plane on to the ladder means (47) when it is not in use and raised to a latched position for use.    6. access apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims including an end member (51) terminating a ladder means and pivotable from a position in which it lies on the ladder means when not in use to an upstanding position when in use.   7. access apparatus as claimed in claims 6 and 7 including means coupling the end member (51) and the handrail (52) during movement between the in use position and the not in use position.   8. access apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims including a platform (13) in the region of the pivot between the upper boom (4) (5) and   the    second boom (3) to facilitate transfer between the first (21) and second (15) (16) ladder
