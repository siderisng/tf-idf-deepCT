<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for recovering PVC powder and processing therein to plastic products that operates material-friendly and energy saving.The aggregated PVC powder is initially heated very quickly by friction heat to a temperature between 340 ° K and 420 ° K and then without intermediate cooling only by thermal energy to a temperature further heated, in which the mixture is just ruling.Then it is immediately fed to the further processing.Furthermore, the invention indicates a device for carrying out the method.
