<ABSTRACT>
a device for removal and disposal of animal excrements  has an elongated handle (14) with a pistol-type grip  (64) at its upper end and a pair of pick-up jaws (22, 24) at  its lower end.  a trigger (18) in the grip is linked to the pivoted  jaw (24) by an actuating rod (20) which passes through  the handle and is urged by a spring (76) to maintain the  pivoted jaw in its open position.  squeezing the trigger  pulls the actuating rod, causing the pivoted jaw to swing  toward the fixed jaw (22) into its closed position.  a releasable  latch arrangement (80-86) maintains the trigger in  its depressed position.  the bottom end of disposable bag  (13) is inserted between the open jaws, after which the  opened portion of the bag is inverted in cuff-like fashion  about the outside of the open jaws.  after collection of  refuse in the bag by closing the movable jaw against the  fixed jaw, the jaws are latched shut, then the cuffed portion  of the bag is reversed off the jaws, the bag is sealed and  freed for disposal by unlatching the jaws.
