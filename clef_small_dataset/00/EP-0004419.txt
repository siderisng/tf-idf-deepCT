<ABSTRACT>
a method of producing pneumatic brake actuator rods  in which a spigot (22) is provided at one end for mounting  a pressure plate (7) and a thread (21) is provided on the  output end, the body of the rod around the root of the spigot  being under cut and thereafter upset by rollswaging or  other means to produce a flange (32) for supporting the  rod against the pressure plate (7) so that the rod can be  of generally substantially reduced diameter in relation to  that used for many years hitherto.
