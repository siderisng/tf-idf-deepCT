<ABSTRACT>
a shock absorber to insulate the steering wheel (12) and  the driver from shocks to which the steerable road wheels  are subjected.  two members (15, 20), one (15) on the  steering wheel and one (20) on the steering shaft (13), are  interconnected only by resilient shock-absorbing material  (29).  safety back-up means (35, 37) provide metal-to-metal  contact between the members in the event of failure of the  resilient material.  in one embodiment the inner member (20)  is made up of similar half members (26) which are riveted  together and to a hub, (22) whereby different hubs can be  provided for different vehicles to accommodate the same  sub-assembly of the annular members and the resilient  material for different applications.
