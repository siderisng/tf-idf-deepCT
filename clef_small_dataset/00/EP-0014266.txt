<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle, particularly a wheel-chair, driven by an elecÂ­ tromotor (4) which is powered by a supply of direct current,  said vehicle being provided with a motor control circuit to  keep the speed of the motor at a chosen adjusted value by the  steps of producing a signal which is representative of the  speed, comparing the signal with the adjusted speed value  and controlling, in dependence on the measured djfference,  the mean value of the current supplied to the motor, in which  the signal which is representative of the speed of the motor is  a voltage derived from the current flowing through the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements in and relating to electrically driven wheel-chairs" the invention relates to a vehicle, particularly a wheel-chair, driven by an electromotor which is powered by a supply of direct current, said vehicle being provided with a motor contra circuit to keep the speed of the motor at a chosen adjusted value by the steps of producing a signal which is representative of the speed, comparing the signal with the adjusted speed value and controlling, in dependence on the measured difference, the mean value of the current supplied to the motor. the signal representative of the speed may be obtained by the use of a tacho-sensor coupled to the motor shaft and generating an alternating current voltage having a frequency which is directly proportional to the speed of the motor. to that end either a special motor provided with a tacho-sensor or a tacho-sensor separately mounted on the shaft of a conventional motor must be used. both possibilities are expensive. a complication is formed by the fact that the frequency of the output signal of the tacho-sensor must be converted into a suitable regulating signal. the invention has for its object to avoid the cited disadvantages and this is achieved in that the signal which is representative of the speed of the motor is a voltage derived from the current flowing through the motor. then a conventional motor can be used, in which the speed of the motor is connected with the current flowing through the motor. an optimally operating regulation is obtained, when the control circuit has such a back coupling as to ensure that its output impedance is of the same magnitude, although in the negative sense, as the inner impedance of the motor. this can be realized in that inserted in the control circuit is an amplifier, the output of which is positively back coupled by voltage by means of a first back coupling circuit and is negatively back coupled by current by means of a second back coupling circuit. for that purpose the motor may be connected to the output of the amplifier through a resistance and the second back coupling circuit may be connected to the junction point between the motor and said resistance. in order to obtain a sufficiently high torque at low speeds the motor may be powered by current pulses, of which the periods are variable. to that end the input voltage of the control circuit may be a fixed alternating current voltage which is superposed on an adjustable direct current voltage. in a wheel-chair for disabled persons the current flowing through the motor will be automatically increased when the speed is in danger of falling below the desired adjusted speed, so that a greater torque is produced to overcome the resistance affecting the speed in negative sense. this is possible without the invalid person having to operate the speed adjusting knob. an example thereof is running over a threshold. when the wheelchair has not been equiped with the circuit according to the
