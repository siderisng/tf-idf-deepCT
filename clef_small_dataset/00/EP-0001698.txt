<ABSTRACT>
normally prepared alkylphenols contain little or no  meta-isomer.  for many purposes meta-isomers are more  desirable than ortho- or para-isomers.  2,6-dialkylphenols  cause colour in phosphate esters made from alkylphenols and  are undesirable.  the invention reduces these problems by  providing a process of isomerisation which increases the  proportion of meta-isomer and decreases that of the 2,6-dialkylphenols,  in which the alkylphenols are heated with  trifluoromethane sulphonic acid.  the alkylphenol which is  isomerised may be prepared in a first step by reaction of olefin  and phenol in the presence of trifluoromethane sulphonic  acid.  in a two stage process an alkylphenol mixture is prepared  by reaction of olefin and phenol in the presence of  trifluoromethane sulphonic acid at a concentration 0. 01 to  5. 0% at a temperature of 120Â°c to reflux and the mixture so  produced is isomerised by maintaining the product at the  same temperature to isomerise it.
