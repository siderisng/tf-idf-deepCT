<ABSTRACT>
high concentration polymer slurries contain up to 60  weight % to 75 weight % xanthan gum in a solvent base  treated with suspending agents, dispersants, and thinning  agents.  mineral oil, diesel oil, kerosene, alcohols (six to  twelve carbons), vegetable oil, ester-alcohols, polyol ethers,  and the like may be used as the solvent.  the preferred  suspending agent is either an organophilic clay or hydroxy­ propyl cellulose.  the preferred dispersant is either an  ethoxylated linear alcohol or a fatty acid ester of vegetable  oil or aminal oil.  the preferred thinning agent is lecithin.   these slurries greatly improve the dispersibiiity of xanthan  gum or any other hydrophilic colloid, such as guar, hydroxy­ propyl guar, cellulosics, polyacrylamides, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
high concentration polymer slurries us. patent 5,894,880 disclose the method of thickening alcohol/water solvent systems with xanthan gum. this system is then used to suspend a slurry of alginates. u.s. patent 5,894,879 discloses tie method of thickening alcohol/ water solvent systems with hydroxypropyl celluloso, other art includes mechanical and chemical means of improvbig the dispersibility of xanthan gum and other hydro philic colloids. mechanical mixers are not completely effective. chemical means consist of either treating the colloid with materials such as dialdehydes that delay hydration or slurring the polymer. the slurries of prior art have two major dis advantages. first, to remain pourable these slurries are limited to polymer concentrations well bclow 50%. secondly, volatile. solvents in these slurry formulations evaporate when exposed to the atmosphere leaving a crusty film of dried polymer on these surface of the slurry. this crust resists reconstitution into the slurry and is noi dispersible in water. in accordance with the present inyention a high concentration polymer slurry comprises 20-75 weight % of fine mesh xanthan gum; 20-75 weight % hydrophobic solvent base; 0.050.25 weight c% suspending agent; optionally 0.5-1 weight % thinning agent and optionally 0.1-7.0 weight , dispersant. dy incorporating a thinning agent such as lecithin, pourable slurries at polymer concentrations exceeding 50% can be obtained. the solvent base used in accordance with the present invention is considerably less volatile than that of the prior art and crust formation can be substantially avoided. the polymer to be dispersed is preferably xanthan gum. other similar hydrophilic colloids can be used in these formu- lations, such as guar gum, hydroxypropyl guar, cellulosics and polyacrylamides. the total weight of polymer in the final composition is from 20-75 weight 50. a finely divided form of polymer is preferable (200-mesh, tyler screen or finer) to achieve these levels. the sieve opening is 0.074 mm in this 200-mesh screen. the term "hydrophobic solvents" herein means anhydrous solvents, i.e. those containing less than 0.1% water, that are insoluble in water and do not solvate or swell hydrophilic colloids and thai have a melting point cf no more than 500c and a vapor pressure at 20tc of no more than 1 torr. the solvent base can be one or more of the following: mineral oil, diesel oil, kerosene, c6-12 alcohols, vegetable oil, ester-alcohols e.g. 2,2,4-trimethyl-pentanediol-1, 3-monoisobutyrate (sold under the trade mark texanol by eastman kodak), polyol ethers, e.g. ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, silicone oils and halogenated solvents. the amount of solvent used is 20-75 weight %. one preferred solvent base is a mixture of diesel oil or kerosene in about equal amounts with a mixture of a c6-10 alcohol. another preferred solvent is mineral oil. the resi of the slurry is made up of minor amounts of suspensing agents, dispersants, and thinning agents. the preferred suspending agent, the amount of which is preferably 0.05-0.25 weight c; 35 an organophilie clay or hydroxypropyl cellulose. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, aluminum/phosphate soaps, aluminum stearate/fatty acid soaps,
