<ABSTRACT>
panels (1,2) for buildings and other enclosures or parts  thereof comprise a substrate on at least one surface of which  is located a finish formed from a liquid hardenable resin and  sand (7).  methods of making panels (1,2) and structures  formed therefrom are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
exterior surface of buildings this invention relates to exterior surfaces of buildings. it is known to apply a resin based layer to the exterior surface of a building. the resin may have incorporated in it a filler so that when the mixture is applied to the surface of the building and the resin hardens the appearance of this resin layer depends to some extent on the nature of the filler. however, the appearance still depends to a large extent on the resin itself giving the surface an unappealing glassy appearance. it has now been discovered that by the selection of sand as the filler, a composition can be produced which, when applied to a substrate, results in a surface finish which has no trace of the characteristic hardened resin appearance. according to the present invention there is provided a method of making an exterior wall for a building or part thereof, the method comprising applying to a substrate a layer of :a composition comprising a hardenable liquid resin in admixture with sand in order to produce a surface finish simulating stone, brick or other natural or artificial finish. preferably the substrate is in the form of a layer or mat of glass fibre which itself is applied to a more solid substrate such as chipboard or other support. more preferably the glass fibre is coated with resin before the resin/sand mixture is applied. preferably the sand is silica sand and the resin is a polyester resin which when mixed with a catalyst hardens in the usual way. if desired, one or more pigments may be added to the mixture in order to produce the desired colour shade. the sand resin mixture may be applied to the surface by means of, for instance, a brush, roller or a suitable spray gun. by way of examples, the following finishes can be obtained: (1) a brick finish by using a mixture of approximately 60% by volume silica sand, together with resin and a small amount of an appropriate resin colouring pigment; (2) a mortar finish, for use together with the brickwork finish in order to produce the pointing effect, may be produced by using a mixture containing approximately 15% by volume silica sand together with resin and resin colouring pigment; (3) a stone finish may be produced using a mixture similar to that for brick but incorporating a different coloured pigment; (4) a slate finish may be obtained by using a mixture of approximately 30% by volume silica sand, 30% by volume plaster, the balance being resin and a small amount of pigment; ; (5) a pebble dash finish may be produced by using a mixture of approximately 40% by volume silica sand in admixture with resin and a small amount of pigment. the pebbles or chippings are applied to this finish before the resin hardens dnd the silica sand/ resin/pigment mixture gives the realistic background appearance to the pebbles or chippings located thereon. in the case of examples (l) to (3) above
