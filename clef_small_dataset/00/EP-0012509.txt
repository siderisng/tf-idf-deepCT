<ABSTRACT>
increased efficiency in the use of a communications  channel between a control unit (10) and a multiplicity of  terminal or satellite units (14) by utilizing the combinations  of the unit address code words and their complements as  coded commands and automatically returned responses.   at least one combination of the control unit address code  words and word complements can be manually entered at  any one of the satellite units (14) to serve as a special  response to one combination of the respective satellite  address code words and word complements, to cause a  change of function or operation at the control unit (10).   the system may be coupled to a host computer and norÂ­ mally the information received by the control unit (10)  would be encoded for transmission to the computer, in  which case the change of function could be the disenabling  of transmission to the host computer.
