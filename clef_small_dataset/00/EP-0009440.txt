<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an improvement in binders for perforated sheets with two flexible plastic binding parts (3), one end of which has a projecting head which passes through the perforations of the sheets, a slide in the form of a flattened "c" (1) having at its ends openings (4), one of which is traversed by the end of one of the binding parts (3), the back of the channel being applied onto the last bound sheet and, finally, on the face opposite the back, two sliders (2) having two projections (2a) engaged under the opposite edges of the slide and joined by a central portion (2b) in the form of a bridge under which are engaged the ends of the binding parts with a view to their locking.  the device is characterised in that each of the ends of the slide carries, on the face opposite the back, a thin metal plate (8) engaged under its edges, the said plate having a sharp-edged opening (7a) with a diameter very close to that of the binding parts and which is traversed by the corresponding binding part.  this device makes it possible to prevent relative sliding of the binding parts and of the slide.  <image>
