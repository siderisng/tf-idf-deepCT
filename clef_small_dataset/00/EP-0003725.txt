<ABSTRACT>
1.  ventilated double glazed window with internal blind, which window has an exterior glazing (2) in the form of a single glass pane on its weather exposed outside forming a channel for outgoing air with interior glazing (3) arranged at a distance from the exterior glazing (2) to the room interior side and also in the form of a single glass pane while the sun blind is provided on the room interior side of the interior glazing (3), characterized in that the distance (a) between the exterior and interior glazing (2 respectively 3) is so reduced that a defined, largely laminar airflow (10) is created in the channel (4) for outgoing air, and that the sun blind (5) has horizontally extending profilations (6) on its surface facing the outside, which profilations (6) largely reflect steeply incident sun rays (7) to the outside, and that the sun blind (5) is provided with a light absorbing and strip-like selective layer between the profilations (6), which layer is so arranged that it is only impinged upon by sunrays (8) when the sun stands low and effects a considerable absorption of sun rays (8) and a heating of the sun blind (5).
