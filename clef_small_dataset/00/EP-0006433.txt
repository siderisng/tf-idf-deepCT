<ABSTRACT>
Device for adjusting the flow of a plug of a distribution pair in a continuous casting installation, by servoing at the metal bath of a receiving ingoiery. Device for adjusting the flow of a plug of a dispensing vessel in a continuous casting installation by servo at the metal bath in the receiving lingot through a known electronic optical device, characterized by the fact that it comprises on each splitter (1) a reduced mechanism (11), with a nearby control station (12), purely mechanical, close to the casting station and connectable by a fast coupling means (17) to the abovemention (11), being itself actuated by a remote mechanical control from a remote control panel (24) having both a manual control (32) and a cylinder control of suggesting ( 37) acting on the same mechanical transmission as (23), while a backup control (40) is planned to act directly on the control station to proximo (12).
