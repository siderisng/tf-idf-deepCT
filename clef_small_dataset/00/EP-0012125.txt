<ABSTRACT>
a device for eliminating disturbing reflections in a reflective surface intended for image display utilizes a screen with a dark, mat surface whose mirror reflection at the reflective surface completely covers the reflective surface. 
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
a device for eliminating disturbing reflection in a display screen the present invention relates to a device for eliminating disturbing reflection in a display screen when this is viewed from a point which is not traversed by the normal to any point on the display screen. many images are presented through transparent material, for example, glass and plexiglass @ this is effected in picture tubes, radar screens, micro film screens, focusing screens, instrument panels etc. disturbing reflection can, here, arise because the display screen, including the surface of the transparent material, is glossy or semi-glossy, that is to say more or less reflective. a disturbing reflection occurs when a relatively bright object is reflected in the display screen or part thereof. such disturbances give rise to discomfort and tiredness, working environmental problems which are now well documented. with the intention of limiting such discomfort, plans are, at the present time, under consideration for a restriction of the permitted length of time for continuous work at, for example, an image display screen, to 2 hours. thus, there is a need in the art for a reduction of reflection disturbances of the above-mentioned type. attempts have long been made to realize such a reduction by means of a series of measures which have a common feature that, at the same time as the reflection is damped, the light strength and/or contrast in the image being displayed is weakened. examples of such measures are the flatting of the display surface by the application of a semi-transparent, mat film, the placing of polaroid filters or fine-mesh nets in front of the display screen, the screening-off of incident light by means of "hoods", the reduction of the ambient light level and the elimination of the sources of such reflection by means of the removal of windows, lamps and other bright objects. it is possible to damp these reflection disturbances by means of such measures, but their effect is, unfortunately, not greater than from 10 to 15%, for which reason no considerable reduction of the discomfort caused by such disturbances has been achieved. certain of the above-mentioned measures involve the manifestation of new problems, such as a worsening of the working environment in the event of removal of the sources of such reflection. the major object of the present invention is to realize a device for the effective elimination of the abovedescribed reflection disturbances. to this end, the present invention calls for the utilization of a completely different principle from those ased in prior art measures. in order to prevent all disturbing reflection from the display screen, a dark, mat surface is, according to the present invention, deliberately reflected at the screen so that the mirror reflection of this surface covers the entire display screen. it will be appreciated that such a reflection requires that the display screen can be viewed from a point which is not traversed by the normal to any point on the display screen. according to the present invention, a device of

<CLAIMS>
 claims    1. a device for eliminating disturbing reflection in a display screen (2) when same is viewed from a point (0) which is not traversed by the normal to any point on the display screen surface, characterized by a shield member (3) with a dark, mat surface, said shield member being designed and located with respect to the display screen surface (2) such that this is completely covered by the mirror reflection of the dark, mat surface at the display screen surface.     2. the device as recited in claim 1, characterized in that a portion of the edge (c) of the dark, mat surface most proximal the point of observation (0) lies in the plane defined by lines from the point of observation to a distal edge (b) of the display screen surface.    3. the device as recited in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the edge (b) of the dark, mat surface located most distal from the point of observation (0) substantially connects with the distal edge (b) of the display screen surface.    4. the device as recited in any one of claims 1-3, characterized in that the shield member (3) is u-shaped with a bottom (4) and two end walls (5).    5. the device as recited in claim 4, characterized in that the shield member (3) is pivotally mounted with respect to the display screen surface.
