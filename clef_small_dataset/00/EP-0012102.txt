<ABSTRACT>
in a public telephone set there are provided a coin pro­ cessing unit (ccc) for sorting coins inserted into the tele­ phone set, a coin box (15) for collecting inserted coins, a  control unit for collecting the sorted coins in the coin box and  sending an origination from the telephone set a plurality of  coin detectors (da, cr, cc, ck) for detecting clogging by coins  of coin passageways to the coin box (15), a control circuit  (mcc) for detecting a fault in accordance with the outputs of  the coin detectors, a memory device which stores a program  for causing the control circuit (mcc) to detect a fault, and a  switch interlocked with a hook switch (h) for starting the  operation of the control circuit (mcc) and the memory device.   there are also provided display devices (dis) connected to the  control devices for displaying a faulty part.  according to this  invention presence or absence of a fault is automatically  detected by hooking off operation and the location of the fault  is displayed.  accordingly the user is informed of the fact that  telephone set can not be used and its use is automatically  prevented and a maintainance man can note the faulty part.

<DESCRIPTION>
public telephone sets. this invention relates to a public telephone set, more particularly a public telephone set capable of detecting or locating a faulty portion. a prior art public telephone set is generally constructed to enable a user to talk by merely inserting a coin or coins and can not detect by itself presence or absence of a fault, so that the user becomes aware of the presence of the fault only after he starts to use the telephone set. thus, the user could not aware of a fault until he dials, thus wasting time. more particularly, among the fault are included a case in which even when a coin is inserted after hook-off, a loop circuit is not closed with the result that a dial tone is not received, a case wherein the inserted coin is returned at once, a case in which notwithstanding accumulation of the coins and a normal dial tone is transmitted, the loop circuit is interrupted, and a case in which remaining coins are not returned after termination of the speech. especially, the last case causes loss of money. most of these faults are caused by clogging by coins of coin passageways between a coin inserting slot and a coin storage vessel or between the coin storage vessel and a coin returning opening. for this reason, it is important to supervize the condition of the coin storage vessel for detecting presence or absence of a fault. in addition to these faults, there are such faults as failure of closing a loop circuit due to incorrect contact of the hook switch and incapability of collecting coins due to a fault of a rate signal receiving circuit. these faults result not only in the incapability of a speecn but also damage to xne owner of the public te- phone set. however, each of these faults can not be detected from outside of the telephone set thus causing inconvenience. to repair a fault a maintenance man must successively inspect various parts according to a maintenance manual which is extemely troublesome. even when a fault is detected, certain type of fault is impossible to repair at the field so that the maintenance man must carry the faulty telephone set to a repair shop. such inconvenience also occurs at the stage of the finaltest in a manufacturing factory of public telephone sets. thus, it is necessary to manually check faulty which increases the cost of manufacturing. for the reason described above, it has long been desired to provide effective means that can clearly display faulty parts. summary of the invention accordingly, it i1s the principal object of this invention to provide an improved public telephone set capable of effecting self diagnosis of a fault. another object of this invention is to provide a public telephone set which is simple in construction and easy to maintain and capable of effecting self diagnosis of a fault. still another object of this invention is to provide a public telephone set consuming less power.
