<ABSTRACT>
the converter comprises a data source (10) from  which half-bytes of data are supplied in a parallel-by-bit,  serial-by-half-byte manner to data registers (14, 16).  the  supply is controlled by control logic (18) so that register  (14) is being filled while register (16) is being emptied  and vice versa.  data from the registers (14, 16) are sup­ plied to steering circuits (28, 30, 32, 34) which act as gating  circuits.  circuits (28, 30) are gated by a first signal taken  from counter (20) and circuits (32, 34) by a second signal  taken from the counter.  the first and second signals are in  anti-phase and are operative so that in one quarter cycle  bits (0, 1) are gated through circuits (28, 30); in the second  quarter cycle bits (2, 3) are gated through circuits (32, 34);  in the third quarter cycle bits (4, 5) are gated through cir­ cuits (28, 30); and in the fourth quarter cycle bits (6, 7) are  gated through circuits (32, 34).  the sample and interleave  circuit (36) receives the signals gated through circuits (28,  30, 32, 34) and is operative, under the control of sample  (a, b, c, d) timing signals, to sample and gate to a com­ mon output line, the outputs of the circuits (28, 30; 32, 34;  28, 30; 32, 34) during the four quarter cycles, two sampling  being made serially every quarter cycle.
