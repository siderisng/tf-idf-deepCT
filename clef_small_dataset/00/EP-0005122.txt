<ABSTRACT>
The dam aims to contain and collect the hydrocarbon tablecloths floating on the surface of the water bodies (lakes, seas, etc.).It is constituted by tanks having a superior opening (16) and an orifice (17), and by floats (15) which maintain these tanks immersed at 9/10 of their height so that the waves flow into the vats toThrough said openings (16) gradually hunting the water through the orifices (17) until the tanks are completely filled with hydrocarbons.
