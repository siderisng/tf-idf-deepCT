<ABSTRACT>
hitherto granular materials (14) have been introduced into molten metal (3) by blowing them with the aid of a carrier gas deep into the molten metal using a dip probe.  to avoid the cooling of the molten metal (3) through the inflowing carrier gas and to avoid the use of long dip probes, the level of liquid in two refractory vessels (1, 6) which are in liquid-conducting communication with each other is periodically altered, so that the molten metal (3) flows alternately with fluidisation from one vessel into the other vessel (1, 6) and the granular materials (14) are thrown onto the flowing metal (3) as it rises.  <image>
