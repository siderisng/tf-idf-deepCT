<ABSTRACT>
1.  tank with device for volume constant drainage of liquid out of the tank, functioning independent from a variable liquid level, containing a drainage pipe which is attached to a drainage pipe socket with its lower end pivoting around a horizontal axis, the upper end of the drainage pipe has an inlet opening which has to be kept at the liquid surface, if necessary with aid of an additional mean, i. e.  a float which supports the buoyant force of the drainage pipe being partly filled with air, characterized inasmuch that additional weights (14, 24) and/or additional forces (16) are forseen and that lifting resp.  force transmissions (11, 23) are connected with the drainage pipe (5), the lifting- resp.  force transmissions (11, 23) are arranged and/or guided in such a way that they are functioning more and more together with the additional weights (14, 24) resp.  the additional forces (16) i. e.  contrary to the buoyant force of the drainage pipe in that moment when drainage pipe lifts upwards.
