<ABSTRACT>
A packaging for solid or pasty filling, which tends to adhere to the packaging material, has a closure member in which a plurality of individual, independent of each other independent recesses (1, 21, 31) are mounted on its side facing the filling material.The recesses are separated by ribs (2) or surfaces.The ribs or surfaces complete the air or gas containing depressions through the contact with the surface of the filling material.Due to the depressions filled in the contents, the force is reduced to remove the closure part, and no or almost no filling material remains such.b.Lift margarine at the closure part.The closure parts may be made of deep-drawn or embossed film or made by embossing a plastic-coated carton.
