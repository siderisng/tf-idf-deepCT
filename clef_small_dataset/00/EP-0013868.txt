<ABSTRACT>
a method and an apparatus for transferring a layer of  mineral wool from one conveyor (3) to another one (14)  whereby mineral wool fibres (1) received from a spinning  chamber (2) are continuously collected on a first conveyor  (3) from which a mineral wool path or layer (4) formed by  said fibres (1) is to be transferred to a second conveyor (14)  for further treatment of the mineral wool path (4).  an opti­ mum large amount of the mineral wool path (4) is moved  over to an intermediate conveyor (11) at a delivering point  (17) of the first conveyor (3) and is by said intermediate  conveyor (11) moved on and is deposited on said second  conveyor (14) at a receiving point (18).  such fibres and  flocks of mineral wool which remain on the first conveyor (3)  subsequent to the delivering point (17) are released from the  first conveyor (3) by a cleaning apparatus (19) and are  transferred to the said second conveyor (14) at a point  advanced of the receiving point (18) therefor for the mineral  wool path (4) transferred by the intermediate conveyor (11)  and are combined at the said receiving point (18) with the  mineral wool path (4) received from the intermediate con­ veyor (11).
