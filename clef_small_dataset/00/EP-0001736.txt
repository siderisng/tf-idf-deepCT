<ABSTRACT>
a dialysis apparatus comprising a cylindrical housing  (12) with both ends open, a plurality of hollow fibers (19)  arranged within the housing (12) sustantially parallel to the  axis thereof, a pair of seal members (20) for securing the end  portions of the hollow fibers (19) to the housing (12) in a  liquid-tight fashion and for separating liquid passages inside  the hollow fibers (19) from a liquid passage outside the hollow  fibers (19) from a liquid passage outside the hollow fibÂ­ ers (19), a dialysate inlet port (17) provided at one end of the  housing (12) near one of the seal members (20) and communicating  with one end of the liquid passage outside the  hollow fibers (19), a solution inlet port (23) and a solution  outlet port (23) provided at the ends of the housing (12),  respectively, and communicating with the liquid passages  inside the hollow fibers (19), and a damper plate (15) disposed  in the vicinity at least of the dialysate inlet ports (19)  for dispersing a flow of dialysate, said dialysate inlet port (23)  having a diameter of 1. 5 to 3. 5 mm and said dialysate outlet  port (23) has a diameter of 6 to 10 mm.
