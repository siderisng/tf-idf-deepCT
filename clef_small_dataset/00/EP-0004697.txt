<ABSTRACT>
a rotary shear machine having a plurality of oppositely  rotating hollow cylinder pairs (25) carrying helical blades (39,  41) for transversely shearing several continuously moving  webs (12) perpendicular to their direction of travel, each  cylinder pair (25) including a separate reversible dc motor  (37) drive and an electronic digital control system regulating  the motor drive for cutting sheets of predetermined lengths  from the respective webs, a web feed (84, 86) and pull roller  (113, 114) system having an independent drive for engaging  and feeding the continuously moving webs (12) into the  respective helical blades (39, 41) and pulling sheets from the  blades (39, 41) as they are cut from the continuously moving  webs (12), the upstream feed roller system including means  (84), for sensing web velocity and generating electronic  pulses for input into the control means regulating the  respective reversible dc motor drives (37) driving the  respective helical blades (39, 41), and means for continuously  generating electronic pulses even though the velocity  sensing component (84) is not in contact with the moving  web (12).
