<ABSTRACT>
a process for the production of vesicular-arbuscular (va)  mycorrhizal fungi comprises growing a va mycorrhizal fun­ gus on plant roots in nutrient film culture.  the resulting  mycorrhizal fungus infected plant roots are of value in produc­ ing a mycorrhizal inoculum, especially for incorporation into a  plant growth medium to enhance the uptake of nutrient by  plants grown therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in or relating to the production of mycorrhizal fungi this invention relates to the production of mycorrhizal roots and their use in soil or plant inoculation. certain fungi in mycorrhizal association with plant roots can enhance plant nutrient uptake, particularly of phosphorus. despite tne great potential of vesicular-arbuscular (va) mycorrhizal fungi for this purpose, however, the practical exploitation of these fungi has been restricted since they cannot at the present be grown without a plant host and this has so far prevented the production of sufficient inoculum for these fungi to be used in fertilier conservation it is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide a novel method suitable for the large scale production of va mycorrhizal roota. accordingly tne present invention comprises the growth of vesicular-arbuscular va) mycorrhizal fungi on plant roots in nutrient film culture. nutrient film culture is a specialised technique developed for the commercial production of crops such as tomatoes, lettuces and cucumbers. it entails the continuous re-cycling of a large volume of nutrient liquid in a film which flows over the roots of plants. this tecnr'ique nas been successfully adapted for the culture of mycorrhizal roots. rhat tni has been possible is, indeed, surprising because bot plant and fungus growth have to be balanced and they nave different optimum requirements. moreover, in nature, the fungi are very sensitive to waterlogging and submerged conditions. the present invention is widely applicable among mycorrhizal systems. among the very wide variety of plants susceptible to mycorrhizal infection, including gymnosperms and particularly angiosperms, preferred hosts are those which are capable of forming large quantities of mycorrhizal roots with the host plant well adapted to nutrient film culture. one particular class of plants of great interest is the legumes in view of their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in their nodules (inhabited by bacteria) which obviates the necessity for the addition of nitrogen in the culture solution and thereby avoids the possible inhibition of mycorrhizal development by excess inorganic nitrogen. examples of legumes are clover, lucerne and particularly beans. in some instances, however, the presence of the legume bacteria in the inoculum may be a disadvantage and a non-legume may be preferred. such non-legumes include cereals and particularly maize. a possible additional advantage is provided by the use of a host plant which will also produce crop for harvesting and in this respect vegetables for human consumption are of particular interest, for example beans and capsicums, but also particularly those crops which are currently grown commercially in nutrient film culture, for example cucumbers and particularly tomatoes and lettuces. an alternative possibility is plants which produce flowers such as carnations, chrysanthemums and freesias. va mycorrhizal fungi (endophytes) which can be used include particularly species of the genera gomus, gigaspora and acaulospora (according to the classification of gerdemann and trappe in the endogonaceae in the pacific northwest mycologia memoir no. 5, 1974, page 76 and others such as nicholson and schenck, mycologia, 1970, 71, 178) but also species of rhizophagus,
