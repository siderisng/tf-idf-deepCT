<ABSTRACT>
the filament 3 is attached to leads 4 and 5 which are  joined at one end by an insulating bead 6.  this forms a  self-supporting filament mount with the lead 5 extending  from the bead 6 arround the filament 3 in a generally helical  or angled path to minimize obstruction of the emitted  light.  a free end 7 of the lead 5, extending beyond the filament  3, passes through one end of the bulb 1 to form one  terminal.  at the other end a press seal is formed in which the  end of the lead 5 is embedded while the lead 4 passes  through to form a second terminal of the lamp.
