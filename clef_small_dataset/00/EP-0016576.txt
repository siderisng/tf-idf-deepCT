<ABSTRACT>
a containment unit for hydrogen storage in which hydÂ­ ridable material (16) is located in depressed zones (12) in  stacked metal trays (11) in a conventional container.  the trays  (11) are stacked in non-nested assembly to provide gas paths  between the masses of hydridable material (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
modular hydride container the present invention relates to a hydrogen containment unit which includes solid hydridable material which reversibly reacts with hydrogen in a given temperature range under the influence of pressure. solid hydridable materials are characterised by an interrelation of temperature, pressure and hydrogen content, such that, at any given temperature, the hydrogen content of the hydridable material is determined by the partial pressure of the hydrogen in contact with that material. generally, as temperature rises it takes a greater partial pressure of hydrogen to maintain a given concentration of hydrogen in the hydridable material. the converse is true as temperature decreases. as hydrogen combines with the hydridable material, heat is given off, i.e. the reaction is exothermic. conversely, when hydrogen is released from hydridable material it absorbs heat and the reaction is endothermic. for these reasons it is necessary that good heat transfer is available between the site of the hydriding or dehydriding reaction and the walls of the container. also, it is necessary to provide gas paths which extend throughout the mass of the hydridable material the present invention is based on the discovery that by dividing the hydridable material into a plurality of separate masses located in a particular structure these reouirements of gas path and heat transfer can be readily met. according to the present invention a hydrogen containment unit comprises a container for hydrogen gas having means for the admittance and withdrawal of gaseous hydrogen, and having a plurality of trays stacked in a nonnesting configuration within the container each tray being made of a hydride resistant material having good heat conductivity and having one or more depressed zone in which a solid hydridable material is located. the container is preferably a conventional steel pressure bottle having inlet/outlet means, for example valved piping, through which gaseous hydrogen can be introduced into, or drawn from, the container. the results of the conventional container, the conventional means for introducing and removing gaseous hydrorn from the container and the multiplicity of trays in the container arranged in non-nesting fashion is a labyrinth of gas transport passages extending through the container and a heat transfer network extending throughout the bulk of the volume of the containment unit. preferably the trays abut on, or are otherwise in heat conductive relationship with the walls of the container. the solid hydridable material is normally used in powder form. the invention will now be more particularly described by reference to the accompanying drawings in which: figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of a tray-like device used in the containment unit of the present invention, figure 2 is a perspective view of a pair of the tray-like devices shown in figure 2, and figure 3 is a perspective view of an alternative form of a tray-like device used in the containment units of the present invention. in all drawings the hydrogen container and the piping and valving have been omitted figure 1 illustrates, in cross-section, tray 11 conveniently made of heat conductive metal,
