<ABSTRACT>
a drive power transmission system (1) having a driving  pulley (2), a plurality of driven pulleys (3,4,5,6) and the power  transmission belt (7, 7a) laid in a serpentine state over the  pulleys, the driving pulley (2) and at least one driven pulley  (4,5,6) which are in contact with the inner surface of the power  transmission belt (7, 7a) having a plurality of v-grooves (22)  arranged circumferentially, to fit ribs (17) formed on the inner  surface of the belt (7, 7a), and the remaining pulley (3) or  pulleys, which are engaged with the outer surface (12) of the  power transmission belt (7, 7a) have a plurality of protrusions  (24) arranged in parallel and circumferentially to engage the  outer surface (12) of the belt (7, 7a), which is flat, and the  power transmission belt (7, 7a) is an endless belt having a  plurality of ribs (17) arranged longitudinally thereof, the ribs  (17) being substantially equal in section in the direction of the  width of the belt (7, 7a) and the outer surface (12) of the belt (7, 7a)  is flat, the driven pulley (3) or pulleys engaged with the  outer surface (12) of the belt (7, 7a) from transverse shifting.
