<ABSTRACT>
1.  a security fence for enclosing objects which are particularly at risk, e.  g.  nuclear power stations or other installations requiring special security, such fence consisting of a wire mesh (4) and an insulated resistance wire, the wire mesh being clamped between and on the outside of posts (1), which are preferably provided with y-arms, the resistance wire triggering an electrical alarm system if the resistance wire is damaged or severed, barbed wire (5) additionally being clamped, if required, between the individual arms (2) of adjacent posts as security against the fence being climbed over, characterized in that the electrical resistance wire is clamped in the form of a netting (9) between the posts (1) on the inside thereof and parallel to the wire mesh (4), the bottom end of the netting being sunk somewhat into the ground, the top end being secured to a wire cable (7) acting as tensioning wire, and a second netting (10) is clamped between the tensioning wire (7) and another wire cable (8) secured to the top end of additional posts (3) lower than the posts (1) for the wire mesh and situated parallel thereto and at a distance therefrom to prevent the fence from being jumped over, the netting (10) being secured to the two wire cables (7, 8) by means of a resistance wire which has a lower tearing strength than the wire constituting the netting (10) and which forms a predetermined breaking point when the netting is loaded with a specific weight.
