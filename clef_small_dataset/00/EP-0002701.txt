<ABSTRACT>
1.  exhaust air conduction device for installation in a wall openning of an exhaust air conduit, which device has a guide surface arranged over an open rectangular base surface, the said guide surface starting from a narrow side of the base surface and projecting into interior of the conduit, and the maximum inclination of the guide surface relative to the base surface being between 10 degrees and 45 degrees, characterized in that the guide surface is formed as an arched dome surface (14) which forms, in all planes running perpendicular to the base surface (12) and parallel to its narrow sides (20, 22), curved, trapezoidal or polygonal one-piece intersection lines starting from the two long sides (16, 18) of the base surface (12), and in that the front side of the exhaust air conduction device arranged over on narrow side (22) of the base surface (12) perpendicular to the base surface is formed as a throttling or regulating surface (28) broken partially or completely longitudinally by predetermined breaking lines (30) running parallel to this narrow side (22).
