<ABSTRACT>
certain radioiodine containing amines useful as brain  imaging agents as well as their preparation are disclosed.  the  compounds of the invention are represented by the formula  wherein i is a radioisotope of iodine with i-123 being  preferred, r is lower alkyl or halogen, r₁ and r₂ are the same  or different and are selected from the group consisting of  hydrogen and lower alkyl, r₃ and r₄ are the same or different  and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl,  aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl and substi­ tuted carbamoylmethyl or r₃ and r₄ taken together with the  nitrogen to which they are attached form a 5- or 6-membered  ring which may be substituted with one or more lower alkyl  groups, x is 0 to 4, y is 0 to 3 and z is 0 or 1, and pharmaceuti­ cally acceptable acid addition salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
radioiodine containing amines, their preparation and their use as brain imaging agents the present invention is directed to radioiodinated amines represented by the formula emi1.1 wherein i is a radioisotope of iodine with i-123 being preferred, r is lower alkyl or halogen, r1 and r2 are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl, r3 and r4 are the same or different, and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl and substituted carbamoylmethyl or r3 and r4 taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a 5- or 6-membered ring which may be substituted with one or more lower alkyl groups, x is 0 to 4, y is 0 to 3 and z is 0 or 1, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. the compounds of formula a are useful for imaging of the brain. as will therefore be appreciated, the compounds of formula a demonstrate rapid accumulation in the brain indicative of an ability to penetrate the so termed "blood/brain barrier." the compounds of formula a demonstrate a marked superiority in stability of the iodine-carbon bond in vivo the stability of the carbon-iodine bond in vivo in combination with the ability to penetrate the blood/brain barrier enable the compounds of formula a to demonstrate rapid localization of the radioiodine in the brain following intravenous administration. in addition to the primary localization in the brain, the compounds of formula a also show localization in the heart, adrenals and pancreas. the stability of the iodine label in vivo; i.e., in the brain, and the ability to penetrate the blood/brain barrier are distinct advantages of the compounds of formula a in their use as brain imaging agents. as utilized herein, the term alkyl indicates a straight- or branched-chain radical containing from 1 to 18 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, n-hexyl, n-octadecyl and the like. the term "lower alkyl" denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. the term "aryl" as utilized herein means an aromatic, mononuclear or polynuclear hydrocarbon such as, for example, phenyl, naphthyl and phenanthryl, with phenyl being preferred. the alkyl portion of "aralkyl" as utilized herein is a straight- or branched-chain alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. preferred aralkyl radicals are benzyl, phenylisopropyl and phenethyl. the terminology "substituted aryl" and "substituted aralkyl" as utilized herein indicate an aryl or an aralkyl radical substituted by a straight- or branched-chain alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, by an alkoxy radical, the alkyl portion of which is as just defined, or by hydroxy or halogen. preferred among this groups is ortho-iodobenzyl. the term "halogen" as utilized herein indicates fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo or trifluoromethyl. the terminology ??substituted carbamoylmethyl" as utilized herein indicates a carbamoylmethyl radical having substitution on either the nitrogen or the methylene bridge. said substituents are preferably aryl or substituted aryl. in formula a,
