<ABSTRACT>
an entertainment machine can be operated by a player,  after insertion of a coin or token into a coin mechanism to  cause the machine to produce a moving or changing visual  display which is terminated at random to give a fixed display,  and a win indication is produced if the fixed display is of a  predetermined nature.  the machine has a control system which incorporates a  processing device and a programme device, which programme  device can be changed to enable different games to be  played with the machine.  the visual display is produced on the front screen (2) of  an electronic visual display unit, such as a cathode ray tube  (45), and the programme device (18) of the control system  determines the nature of the display produced on the screen  (2).
