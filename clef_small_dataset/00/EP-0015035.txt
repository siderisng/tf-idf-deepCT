<ABSTRACT>
a water-dilutable maleinized oil base coating composi­ tion is prepared by mixing from about 30 to about 95% by  weight of water-dilutable maleinized oil with from about 5 to  about 70% by weight of a solid particulate epoxy group-­ containing compound having a number average molecular  weight of at least 1000 and an epoxy equivalent weight in the  range of 450 to 7500, the average particle size being from  about 0,5 to 35 µm.  the percentages by weight of the separate  binder components are based on the total weight of the two  components on a solvent free basis.  the novel coating com­ position can be used to advantage for coating any substrate  and particularly for coating automobile bodies.  the invention  also relates to a process for applying and baking said coating  composition and to substrates thus obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
coating composition having a water-dilutable maleinized oil base, process for the application and baking thereof and coated substrates thus obtained. this invention relates to a coating composition based on a waterdilutable maleinized oil. a water-dilutable maleinized oil of the type contemplated herein is a water-soluble product obtained by the addition of an a,-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for instance maleic acid or fumaric acid, or an anhydride thereof, to a product which substantially consists of an ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an alcohol containing 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups, for instance a trivalent or tetravalent alcohol such as glycerol, trimethylol propane or pentaerythritol. instead of or besides said alcohols other hydroxyl compounds may be used, for instance low-molecular reaction products of epichlorohydrin and bisphenol-a or copolymers from styrene and allyl alcohol. any suitable ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid which contains one or more carbon to carbon double bonds may be used, such as, for example oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, sorbic acid, eleostearic acid and licanic acid, or mixtures thereof. any suitable ester of an ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and a polyhydric alcohol may be used, such as, for example, natural oils, such as linseed oil, soya bean oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, rape seed oil, cotton seed oil, wood oil, fish oil and castor oil, or synthetic oils prepared from a fatty acid and a polyhydric alcohol such as trimethylol propane or pentaerythritol. the ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid or the polyolester thereof generally has an iodine value between 80 and 370, and preferably within the range of from 130 to 200. in the maleinized oil still other compounds may be bonded, for instance: monocarboxylic acids, such as palmitic acid, benzoic acid, p-tert-butyl benzoic acid, dicarboxylic acids, and compounds such as colophony or dimerized, oxidized or hydrogenated colophony. further, the oil may be modified with, for instance, styrene, vinyl toluene or cyclopentadiene. the maleinized oil contains 10 to 40 per cent by weight, and preferably 18 to 25 per cent by weight of the a,ss-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid and the oil has an acid number in the range of 115 to 475, and preferably of 210 to 290. to render the maleinized oil dilutable with water the oil is entirely or partly neutralized in a known manner with an alkaline compound. suitable alkaline compounds are inorganic hydroxides, such as ammonia or lithium hydroxide, or primary, secondary or tertiary amines, for instance, monoethylamine, monobutylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine. the maleinized oil may be prepared in a known manner, for instance by reaction of the a,s-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with the ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid or the polyol ester thereof, at a temperature generally within the range of fom 150 to 260 c, optionally in the presence of a catalyst. the afore-described water-dilutable maleinized oils find application as film-forming constituent in coating compositions such as varnishes and paints. such coating compositions, however, have a number of disadvantages. particularly at a solids content of more than 35%, only water being
