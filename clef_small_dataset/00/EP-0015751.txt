<ABSTRACT>
in a process for the continuous mass polymerization of  a solution comprising a alkenyl aromatic monomer having a  diene rubber polymer dissolved therein, in which the solu­ tion is polymerized in a first reaction zone to about 15 to  50% conversion, whereby particles of the diene rubber are  dispersed in a partially polymerized solution, followed by  further polymerization of the partially polymerized solution  in a second reaction zone to about 20 to 95% conversion,  the size of the diene rubber particles can be controlled by  having present in the solution, as fed to the first reaction  zone, a polymer of the alkenyl aromatic monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the continuous production of polyblends derived from an alkenyl. arostic monomer and a diene rubber it is. known to polymerize solutions comprising alkenyl aromatic monomers having a diene rubber dissolved therein to form polyblends having a matrix phase of polymers of said monomers having dispersed therein particles oa said diene rubber grafted with said monomers. mass and mass/suspension processes have been used to prepare such polyblends. u. s. patent 3,903,202 is one such.suitable process for the continuous mass polymeriza tion of such polyblends and it is hereby incorporated by reference. the morphology of the rubber particles dispersed in the polyblend is critical to the final properties of the polyblend. generally, the larger the size of said rubber particles, the greater the toughness and the smaller the size, the higher the gloss. hence, the size of the rubber particles must be controlled to insure the control of the properties of the polyblend. u. s. patent 3,903,202 dis closes that agitation during the early phases of polymer ization disperses the dissolved rubber as particles and that higher rates of agitation generally decreases the size of said particles with lower rates of agitation producing larger particles. controlling agitation rates then pro vides a means for sizing said rubber particles. it has been found that lower rates of agitation, however, creates problems of heat transfer and inhomogeneity that are diffi cult to control when operating at the lower agitation rates needed to produce larger particles. this is particularly true in continuous processes wherein large amounts of monomers are being polymerized and heat and homogeneity control are imperative to process and product control. the art has disclosed other methods for sizing the rubber particles other than by agitation rates. u. s. patent 3,660,535 discloses a method wherein a.partially polymerized solution of rubber and monomers is recycled into a stratifying type polymerizing system having linear flow. the effluent from the first reactor, having a conversion of about 20 to 38%, is recycled as a partially polymerized solution in varying amounts to the feed stream at a location of essentially zero conversion and prior to phase inversion in the first reactor. this procedure has been found to vary the particle size of the rubber during the inversion of the rubber phase, however, control has been found to be difficult because the recycle stream contains grafted rubber particles that have varying levels of graft varying with levels of conversion in the recycle stream. the grafted rubber particles in the rubber phase has been found to act as a soap or dispersing agent for the rubber particles in the monomer-polymer phase during inversion of the two phases, hence, minor variations in graft or conversion have a profound effect on particle size control. this is particularly evident as polymerization is carried out in a linear flow stratifying reactor system wherein inversion gradually occurs as the feed stream is progressively polymerized from 0% to 20 to 38% conversion down through the stratified reactor. u., s. patent 3,398,214 disclosed a
