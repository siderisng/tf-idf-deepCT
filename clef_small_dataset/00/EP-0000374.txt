<ABSTRACT>
a method for the design of a packing laminate (5) and  a packing laminate (5) manufactured according to this  method.  packing containers are often made from a laminated  material including a relatively thick carrier layer on both  sides of which thinner, liquid-tight plastic layers are applied.   during its conversion into a packing container the laminate  (5) is folded and especially when one or more layers (3,  4, 5) are to be folded at the same time there is a great risk  that cracks occur in the layer situated on the outside of  the carrier layer in the fold, which layer is severely stretched  during the folding.  according to this invention it is suggested  to diminish the stretching of the outer layer (3) by cutting  through the carrier layer where the fold is to be made,  so that the carrier layer can be compressed during the  folding.  this makes the distance around the fold shorter for  the outer layer (3) so that the stretching is diminished and  kept inside the strechability of the material, which means  that cracks can be avoided.
