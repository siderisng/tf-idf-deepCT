<ABSTRACT>
a thyristor (20) is disclosed, which is preferably fabri­ cated as a single thyristor device in an integrated circuit.   the thyristor is made conductive by applying an ordinary  gating voltage to the gate thereof.  however, the thyristor  can be kept in a conductive state, even though a current  flowing through the anode and cathode thereof is once  stopped, if the current is restored to flow therethrough  again within a predetermined short time after when the cur­ rent has stopped.  the thyristor is comprised of a first tran­ sistor (11), a second transistor (12), both of which are  also used in a typical thyristor component, a third transis­ tor (23) which forms a darlington connection with the se­ cond transistor (12), a resistor (22) which is connected  between the base and the emitter of the third transistor  (23) and a capacitor (21) which is connected between  the base of the second transistor (12) and the emitter of  the third transistor (23).
