<ABSTRACT>
a low-density disposable absorbent bandage, in particular  a disposable diaper (1), provided with an absorbent pad  comprised of an airlaid mat of relatively stiff, high yield wood  pulp fibers having relatively little cohesive strength in airlaid  form or a similar low-strength absorbent preferably encapsulated  by an envelope (2)(4) of wet strength tissue paper.  the  absorbent pad (21) is preferably enclosed between a liquid-retaining  backsheet (6) and a liquid-pervious topsheet (5)  secured in superposed relation to the liquid-retaining backsheet.   a wet strength tissue ply (30) having a maximum  stretch characteristic of about thirty percent, as measured at  the point of rupture, is preferably located in a plane approximately  midway between the outermost tissue plies which  encapsulate the low strength absorbent media.  the low  stretch, wet strength tissue ply imparts unexpected  improvements in pad integrity to the structure in use,  thereby facilitating maximum utilization of the greater void  volume inherent in such low density structures for more efficient  absorption and retention of body exudates.
