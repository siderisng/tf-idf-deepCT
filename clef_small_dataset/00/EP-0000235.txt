<ABSTRACT>
laundry detergent compositions containing no phosphate  or low levels of phosphate materials and specific mixtures  of selected nonionic surfactants and selected cationic  surfactants are disclosed.  the nonionic/cationic surfactant  mixtures are formulated to have "cloud point" characteristics  and, preferably, reduced cationic monomer concentrations  as defined herein.  these compositions are unusually  effective in removing greasy and oily soils and body soils  from fabrics; they are also effective in the removal of particulate  soils.  a process is disclosed for laundering fabrics using  compositions containing nonionic surfactants and cationic  surfactants.
