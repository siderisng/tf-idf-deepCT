<ABSTRACT>
a transport mechanism for transporting a series of carrier  members (1-7) carrying a plurality of receptacles through a  processing zone (10) wherein the carrier members (1-7) are  sequentially acted on by a primary driving means in a first  passageway (8) and are passed to a second (9) and optionally  to a third passageway by angled guide grooves (30-42) in the  base of each member and pivots (29) in the floor of the passageway  and angled camming surfaces (15-21) respectively at  the leading edge of each carrier member and at an appropriate  corner between the first passageway (8) and the second  passageway (9).  each carrier member may contain materials  in the receptacles for sampling, analysing or for automatic  laboratory testing in the processing zone (10).  components  may be carried if desired.
