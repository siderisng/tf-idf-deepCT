<ABSTRACT>
harvested sugar beets are treated to reduce storage  losses of recoverable sucrose by contacting the beets with  propylene.  the treatment may be effected by spraying an  aqueous solution of propylene onto the beets, by dipping  the beets into an aqueous solution of propylene, by con­ tacting the beets with gaseous propylene, or by other suit­ able means.  propylene concentrations less than about 750  ppm, preferably in the range of about 10 to about 500  ppm, and more preferably about 20 to about 200 ppm, are  effective to reduce storage loss of recoverable sucrose.
