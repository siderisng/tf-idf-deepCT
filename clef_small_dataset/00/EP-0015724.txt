<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a coin dispenser for use in vend足 ing machines for giving out change when the value of money  inserted into the machine exceeds the price of the merchan足 dise purchased.  the aim of the invention is to simplify the de足 sign of such a dispenser so that different sets of coins can be  catered for from a small range of parts.  the dispenser comprises vertical coin tubes (12, 13, 14),  one for each denomination of coin dispensed, and respective  channels (15, 16, 17) extending horizontally beneath each  tube.  each channel has an aperture (21, 22, 23) in its lower wall  offset from the axis of the tube, (12, 13, 14) and an apertured  slide plate (24, 25, 26) is movable in the channel (15, 16, 17)  from below the coin tube (12, 13, 14) to over the aperture (21,  22, 23) in the lower wall so as to dispense the coins singly from  the stacks in the coin tubes.  the coin tubes extend down through apertures (18, 19,  20) in the upper wall of their respective channels so that the  lower end of the tubes are the lowest point in the coin chan足 nels.  with this arrangement a range of denominations of coins  of differing thicknesses can be catered for by setting the lower  end of the tube at a height appropriate to the thickness of the  denomination of coins during assembly.
