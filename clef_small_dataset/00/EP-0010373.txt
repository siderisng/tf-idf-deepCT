<ABSTRACT>
ethanol and/or acetaldehyde is (are) produced by react­ ing methanol and synthesis gas at elevated temperature and  pressure in the presence of a catalyst consisting of (a) cobalt,  (b) an iodide or a bromide and (c) a polydentate ligand  wherein the donor atoms are selected from nitrogen, phos­ phorus, arsenic, antimony and bismuth, ethanol being the  predominant product when the donor atoms are exclusively  nitrogen or phosphorus, particularly phosphorus, and acetal­ dehyde being the major product when the donor atoms are  exclusively arsenic, antimony or bismuth.  a particularly effec­ tive polydentate ligand is one having the formula:   (r¹) (r²)x-[c (r⁵) (r⁶)]n -y(r³)(r⁴) (ii)   in which x and y are independently nitrogen, phosphorus,  arsenic, antimony or bismuth; n is an integer; (r¹), (r²), (r³)  and (r⁴) are independently saturated monovalent organic rad­ icals containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.  examples of  polydentate ligands which are effective in the production of  ethanol are those having the formula (ii) in which (r¹), (r²),  (r³) and (r⁴) are c₆h₅-, x and y are phosphorus and n has the  value 4 to 6.
