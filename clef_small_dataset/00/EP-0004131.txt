<ABSTRACT>
a modular unit as described for use in a multiunit  decorative or structural arrangement.  each modular unit has, on at least one surface, an  asymmetrical design (2) which may be two-dimensional or  three-dimensional.  these asymmetrical designs are arranged so that portions  (3,4) of the design terminate at edges of the surface in  such a manner to permit a number of identical units to be  arranged together to form a large variety of overall designs  whose final form depends upon the relative positions of the  individual units within the arrangement.  for example, a  number of identical square tile units are provided, each having  the same design and with the design created so that a tile  wall can be formed from the identical tiles with hundreds of  different overall designs.  the same large number of overall  designs may be formed from units other than square units  including three-dimensional building blocks and similar  basic decorative or construction units.
