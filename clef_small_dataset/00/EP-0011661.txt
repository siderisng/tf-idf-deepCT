<ABSTRACT>
a recycling process for flexible polyurethane foam which  comprises dissolving the foam in low molecular weight diol,  admixing therewith high molecular weight polyol that is suitable  for preparation of flexible urethane foam, removing  under vacuum low molecular weight diol solvent from the  admixture obtained, and recovering the residue which comprises  polyol product that may be used to provide new flexible  foam with desirable properties including advantageous tear  strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification title: process for tr@ating polyurethane description this invention relates to methods for treating polyurethane. considerable effort has been heretofore. directed to the development of recovery methoda for polyurethane scrap materials, particuzarly polyurethane foams including flexible, rigid and semi flexible foams. one approach in recovering useful materials from flexible foam utilizes low molecular weight aliphatic diols to effect thermal decomposition of the foam for subsequent processing. (see, for example, u.s. patents 3,983,087; 3,738,946; 3,632,530; 3,300,417; and 2.937,151). in treating flexible foam by thermal decomposition with low mqlecular weight diol, a separation over a period of time of the decomposition product obtained into two liquid layers has not been an altogether satisfactory consequence. u,s. patent 3,738,946 describes such consequence and shows mitigation of its effect by preparing rigid foams from balanced proportions of the resultant layers. u.s. patent 3,983,087 alternatively uses particular amounts of certain alkyl substituted low molecular weight diols to provide a single phase decomposition product that is said to be suitable for preparation of certain polyurethane products. u.s. patent 3,632,530 provides for separating the layers obtained from certain flexible foams by rather extreme reaction conditions and cooling of the dissolution product before further purification. each of the approaches in the above-identified patents while evidencing merit, does have certain drawbacks. for example, the type of alkyl substituted glycol utilized in u.s. 3,983,087 may be even more expensive than the polyol originally used in making the flexible foam. moreover, the process of u.s. 3,738,946 apparently is not seen to be applicable to recycling scrap flexible foam back into products suitable for preparation of new flexible foam. still further, the process of u.s. 3,632,530 appears to require extended periods for completion. according to the present invention there is provided a method for treating flexible polyurethane which comprises dissolving the polyurethane in a low molecular weight diol at a temperature up to 210 c; characterised in that during dissolution or thereafter a high molecular weight liquid polyol that is suitable for use in preparation of flexible polyurethane foam is admixed with i e polyurethane, and at least part of the low molecular weight diol is removed under vacuum from the liquid at mixture obtained at a temperature in a range exceeding about 10000, to leave a liquid polyol residue. the method of this invention provides not only a rapid procedure for recovery of desirable liquid polyol product from the flexible foam, but, furthermore a polyol product that is suitable for use in the preparation of new flexible foam. rather than proceeding with conditions that necessitate formation of separate liquid layers after heating the flexible foam in the presence the law molecular weight diol, the method herein allows formation and use of a single phase dissolution product. moreover, economic use of readily available diol is achieved. the preferred method of this invention utilizes low molecular weight aliphatic diols, especially alkylene glycols such as diethylene glycol to thermally dissolve flexible polyurethane foam at temperatures up to 2100c during periods normally ranging up to about
