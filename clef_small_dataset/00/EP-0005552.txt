<ABSTRACT>
the method of functioning of this heating and mixing installation for building materials is based on a continuously or discontinuously working mixing processing installation which, with mechanical working procedures which are known in building machinery technology, such as conveyor mixing, paddle mixing, drum mixing etc. , works the building goods, building materials or other substances for structural engineering, with simultaneous heating, in order to manufacture or modify particular mixed goods or products which are usual in building technology.  in this heating and mixing installation, the building goods, which are to be thermally treated, are heated, according to process technology, without contact and homogeneously on the surface and in volume, with one or more electromagnetic fields which are electrically produced by one or more high-frequency or microwave generators.  the heating process also brings about drying of the building materials with field energy from the high-frequency or the microwave generator.  <image>
