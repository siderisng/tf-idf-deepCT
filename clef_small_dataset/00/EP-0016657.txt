<ABSTRACT>
a cartridge for an inked ribbon for type bar typewriters  comprises a container 20 adapted to be mounted on one side  of the printing point and a terminal part 24 which guides a  length of ribbon 18 up the printing point and reverses the  direction thereof for re-entry of the ribbon into the container.   two return surfaces 29 and 30 of the terminal part carry the  ribbon re-entering the container back at the same height as  the emerging ribbon.  the container 20 is of elongated shape  and is fixable removably to a support 21 on the machine  rocking in front of a platen 11 in such a manner that the  terminal part 24 of the cartridge is disposed below the  printing line.  there is provided a mechanism for actuating  the inked ribbon which comprises a control element actuatÂ­ able by the type bars and a toggle joint 75, 76 which rocks the  cartridge support 21 for producing a precise raising of the  ribbon in response to variable stroke control actuated by the  selected key.  a control pin 60 is rotatable on the support and  is actuated by the control element to engage vertically a  driving hub 49 of the cartridge and fees the inked ribbon 18 in  front of the printing point.
