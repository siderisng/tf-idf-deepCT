<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a process for the preparation of  the ethyl and propyl ethers of clavulanic acid and salts and  esters thereof, which process comprises the reduction of an  ester of a compound of the formula (ii):    wherein r₂ is a ch = ch₂ or ch = chch₃ group, and thereafter  or simultaneously, if desired, converting the thus-formed  ester of the ethyl or propyl ether of clavulanic acid to the  corresponding acid or a salt thereof.  the compounds of the formula (ii) and salts and esters  thereof are novel and have β-lactamase inhibitory properties,  and this invention further provides these compounds, a process  for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions  containing them.
