<ABSTRACT>
1.  a removable connecting device capable of interconnecting cylindrical tube portions (15, 16) which are disposed in a row, and transmitting a rotary torque, characterized in that it comprises two identical elementary members (13-14) which, when they are assembled, have an outside surface of revolution whose largest diameter (3) does not substantially exceed the diameter of the tubes to be connected, each member comprising a male engagement region (1) at one end and a connection region (4, 5) at the other end, the connecting surface having an elementary pattern comprising raised portions and hollow portions (10, 12, 11) and repeated at least twice around the circumference, the elementary pattern having an axis of symmetry which passes through the axis of revolution (y-y1) and which is perpendicular thereto.
