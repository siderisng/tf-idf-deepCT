<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an improved method of compact­ ing waste for the purpose of allowing this process to be  implemented continuously.  to this end, the waste to be com­ pacted is supplied alternately on the one side and on the other  side of a displacement member (4) which is reciprocating  underneath the supply opening (13) of the compacting space,  so that the displacement member (4) compresses the waste  towards both sides in the compacting space.  the invention furthermore relates to an apparatus for  implementing the method, which apparatus consists of a  box-like housing (1) which encloses a compacting space  which houses in a close fit a reciprocating displacement  member (4) and which comprises a supply opening (13) in a  wall of the housing for supplying the waste to be compacted  to the compacting space, the displacement member (4) being  located in the central area of the compacting space, in such a  way as allow compression of the waste to be compacted to  take place on both sides of the displacement member.
