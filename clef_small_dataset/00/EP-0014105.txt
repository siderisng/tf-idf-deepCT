<ABSTRACT>
a flavourant composition for tobacco may be produced  by heating certain synthetic inorganic ion-exchangers contain­ ing zirconium or titanium together with a tobacco flavourant in  an organic solvent to adsorb the flavourant on the exchanger.   said flavourant compositions may be used advantageously in  filter cigarettes, for example by adding them to the filter tip in  the form of a triple-filter or dual-filter.  the flavourant in flavour­ ant compositions of the invention added to filter tips scarcely  volatilizes on standing but is released readily from the compo­ sition by wet smoke passing through the filter tip when the ci­ garette is smoked, whereby the aroma and taste of the flavour­ ant may effectively be produced.  the amount of tobacco flavour­ ant capable of producing proper (or moderate) aroma and  taste is far less than that of flavourants that have customarily  been added to blended cut tobacco.  the ion-exchangers in the  compositions of the invention do not affect the essential aroma  and taste of the tobacco flavourants.
