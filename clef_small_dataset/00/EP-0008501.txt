<ABSTRACT>
in order to extend battery life when batteries are used and  to conserve energy when commercial power is used, it is  highly desirable that power not be applied to a data processor  when it is not operating.  a power supply in accordance with  the present invention includes a power-up and supply subcir­ cuit (100) that applies power to an associated data processor  (500) when a data input circuit (700) is operated to select a  particular operation of the processor.  ideally, when the pro­ cessor completes its operation, it provides an output signal to  a power-down subcircuit (200) of the power supply which  then removes power from the processor.
