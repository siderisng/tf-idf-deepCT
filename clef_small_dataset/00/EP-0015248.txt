<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a simplified mounting device for  connecting a rotary-cutter tool with a machine spindle.  the  mounting device is of two-piece structure, one piece constitut­ ing an arbor (10) connectable to the spindle, the other con­ stituting a tool holding adapter (11).  the adapter (11) is con­ nected with the arbor (10) by means of a clamping bolt (13)  centrally received within a central bore (26) of said arbor for  the transmission of cooling medium to the cutter tool.  a very  good precision and centering is attainable at the mounting of  the tool due to the provision of a cylindrical extension (16) on  said adapter, which comprises two cylindrical portions (27,  28) with different diameters provided with a close interfit  against complementary surfaces within said bore (12) in said  arbor.

<DESCRIPTION>
m for rotarv-#utter tools e present invention relates to a mounting device for connecting a rotary-cutter tool with a machine spindle, comprising a conical arbor to be connected with the spindle and an adapter for holding the cutting tool. chip cutting tools such as drills and milling cutters are usually connected to its spindle by means of some kind of chuck or mounting device, one end portion or which is machine oriented and the other end of which being tool oriented. a very large number of various mounting devices are previously known which often are designed to match perfectly with a specific type of tool. german patent specification 1.552.556 discloses a mounting device comprising a conical arbor and an adapter for the connection of a cutting tool to a machine spindle. the arbor is formed with two sections of different diameters for fitting with corresponding guide surfaces on the adapter. the arbor is partly surrounded by the adapter, which is connected to the arbor by means of two separate flanges threadably engaged with each other which surround a flange portion of the adapter whilst being secured to the machine spindle. no means for the supply of coolant to the cutting tool is provided in connection therewith. it is therefore an object or the invention to provide a simplified mounting device of two-piece structure that occupies a minimum of space laterally and which simultaneously provides for effective coolant supply. the mounting device of the invention consists of a machine oriented member and a tool oriented member that provide for a very good precision for the rotary-cutter tool to be entered thereinto. the effective supply of coolant to the cutting tool is simultaneously achieved by the provision or a centrally apertured clamping bolt, which is arranged to hold the cutting tool. when it is desirable to change diameters of the cutter tool only the tool oriented member of the mounting device needs to be exchanged which enables a reduction of costs. a preferred embodiment of the invention will flow be #escribed in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which: fig. 1 is an axial sectional view or the arbor member of the mounting device, and fig. 2 is an axial sectional view of the adapter showing also a rotary-cutter tool entered thereinto. referring now to figs. 1-2 of the drawing, there is shown an arbor 10 and a tool adapter 11. the arbor 10 has a bore 12 ex- tending centrally therethrough, the upper portion ol' which connectable with the machine spindle by means of a threaded bolt (not shown). the lower portion of the bore 12 is enlarged and re ceives a clamping bolt 13 which at its lower end portion has an external thread 14 adapted to engage a corresponding internal thread 15 of an axially extending cylindrical centering portion 16 of the adapter 11s which is to be received in a corresponding portion of the bore 12 upon clamping. the internally threaded por tion 15 of the adapter 11
