<ABSTRACT>
electroconductive articles such as paper have a coat足 ing consisting essentially of (1) a barrier coating com足 prising a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, a styrene-足 butadiene latex, sodium alginate or a fluorocarbon with  starch or a modified starch; and (2) an electroconductive  coating.  such articles are made by applying the barrier  coating to a substrate, allowing it to dry, applying the elec足 troconductive coating over the barrier coating and allowing  it to dry.

<DESCRIPTION>
electroconductive articles this invention relates to electroconductive paper and other electroconductive articles. in the coating art, as currently practised for electroconductive papers, barrier coatings usually consist of only starch, starch that has been chemically modified in a known manner, or a combination of starch and a resin, such as a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride. the barrier-coated sheet is subsequently overcoated with a cuating that has electroconductive properties and is then ref erred to in the trade as conductive base stock. using the preceding manufacturing process, frequent problems occur with the base stock in obtaining the required degree of solvent holdout, conductivity and low tackiness. particularly at high relative humidities, tack nests of the conductivized paper callses numerous production problems on the coating machine and calender stacks, resulting in reelblocking and processing difficulties. our unique barrier coating for electrocondiictive paper, when used in combination with a suitable conductive polymer frmulaticn, will provide 4 finished conductive base stock that has improved solvent holdout and conductivity, and a low degree of tackiness at high relative humidities. in accordance with the present invention, a barrier coating consists essentially of from 5 to 50 percent by weight of a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, a styrene-butadiene latex, sodium alginate or a fluorocarbon, together with from 95 to 50 percent by weight of a modified starch this coating may be applied to the paper raw stock by conventional coating techniques in amounts ranging from 0.8 to 3.5 g/m2. the conductive coating may contain from 10 to 90 percent by weight, preferably 70 to 90 percent by weight, of an electroconductive polymer and from 10 to 90 percent by weight of a combination of pigments and/or binders. this coating may also be applied to one or both sides of the barrier-coated paper by conventional coating techniques, such as blade, air knife or reverse roll methods in amounts ranging from 0.8 to 6.0 g/m2 per side of the paper. the preferred copolymer of ethylene'and vinyl acetate is an aqueous latex product marketed by air products and chemicals, inc., as airflex 110 and the preferred modified starch is a hydroxyethylated, acetylated, oxidized or cationic starch. the nature of the electroconductive polymer component of the improved coating formulations of this invention is not critical. any of a variety of electroconductive polymers, both cationic and anionic, may by employed provided that the conductive polymer selected is capable of imparting adequate surface resistivity to the base raw stock. as cationic electroconductive polymers, there may be employed any watersoluble cat ionic polymer containing quaternary ammonium functional groups. included in such cationic polymers are those of the formula: emi3.1 wherein: r stands for hydrogen or lower alkyl; r, represents a member of the class composed of - a -n (r3)3 or emi3.2 r2 stands for -a-n-(r3)3 wherein, in turn, a represents a lower alkylene, an hydroxy-lower alkylene or lower- alkyl-substituted lower alkylene group, and r3 stands for a lower alkyl group. these polymers include those wherein the quaternary ammonium functional group
