<ABSTRACT>
heterocyclic derivatives of guanidine selected from  the group consisting of a compound having the formula:    and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts  thereof wherein;   z is selected from the groups    wherein:   a is o and s;   n is zero or 1;   r₁ is methyl and ethyl;   r₂ is loweralkyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and benzyl;    wherein w is o, s, n-loweralkyl and n-aryl; and   r₃ is alkyl having from 4 to 10 carbons;   phenyl; methylenedioxyphenyl; phenyl substituted  with from 1 to 3 substituents consisting of halo, loweralkyl,  and loweralkoxy; and phenyl substituted with hydroxy,  benzyloxy, nitro: trifluoromethyl and methylthio;   naphthyl; cyclopentyl; cyclohexyl; exo-2-norbornyl;  endo-2-norbornyl; 1-adamantyl;   arylalkyl in which the aryl function is phenyl and the  alkyl function has from 1 to 4 carbons; and   diphenylalkyl in which the alkyl function has from 1  to 2 carbons, possess pharmacological properties, partic­ ularly as hypoglycemic agents.
