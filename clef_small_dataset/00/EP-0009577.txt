<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to preparations for increasing the  resistance of swine to swine dysentery infection.  the novel  preparation of this invention comprises enteric-coated  orally-administrable particulate material containing concen­ trated killed cells of a virulent isolate of treponema  hyodysenteriae.  in the preferred method of use, the resis­ tance of swine to dysentery infection is increased by  administering a parenteral preparation prior to the oral prep­ aration, which can comprise a series of oral doses following  the parenteral dose.

<DESCRIPTION>
vaccine- and vaccination--for swine dysentery an anaerobic spirochete, treponema hyodysenteriae, has been charcterized as the primary etiological agent in swine dysentery. harris, d.l.; glock, r.d.; christensen, c.r.; and kinyon, j.m.: vet. med./small animal clin. 67:61 (1972); taylor, d.j.; and alexander t.j.l.: brit. vet. j. 127:108 (1971). but relatively little is known about the immunology of swine dysentery although resistance to reinfection can be demonstrated in convalescent pigs. in 1976, glock et al reported that parenteral vaccination of pigs with killed cells of a virulent isolate of 't. hyodysenteriae provided a significant degree of protection against subsequent intragastric challenge with live virulent t. hyodysenteriae. glock, r.d., schwartz, k.j., and harris, d.l., proceedings, international pig veterinary society congress, june 1976, ames, iowa. the vaccine was given in six intravenous injections at 6-day intervals. this was the first reported success in immunizing swine against swine dysentery infection. for field use, an oral vaccine would be more convenient to use. however, previous attempts to develop an oral vaccine have produced discouraging results. hudson et al found that oral dosing of an attenuated strain of t. hyodysenteriae provided no protection against subsequent challenge. hudson, m.j., alexander, t.j.l., lysons, rj, wellstead, p.d., brit. vet. j. (1974) 130:37. subsequently, hudson et al attempted to immunize pigs with live attenuated t. hyodysenteriae using a combination of oral dosing and parenteral inoculation. hudson, m.j., alexander, t.j.l., lysons, r.j., prescott, j.f., res. vet. science (1976) 21:366. oral doses were administered on three consecutive days, and after an interval of several days, intraperitoneal vaccinations were administered, which were followed after several more days by intramuscular vaccinations the overall results of these tests were summerized as follows: "although vaccination appeared to enhance immunity to swine dysentery, half of the vaccinated pigs developed the disease. this level of protection would be unlikely to be of practical value in the field." the present invention is based in part on the discovery that the resistance of swine to dysentery infection can be increased by orally administering enteric-coated particulate material containing concentrated killed cells of a virulent isolate of treponema hyodysenteriae. the enteric coating is selected so that it will be resistant to dissolving in the swine stomach while dissolving in the swine intestines to release the killed cells for immunizing action. preferably, the enteric coating is substantially insoluble in water at a ph below 5.0, while becoming slowly soluble in water at a ph of 5.8 to 6.2. oral preparations prepared in accordance with the present invention are particularly useful for administration to young pigs which are subject to swine dysentery infection. for this purpose, the oral vaccine is preferably prepared in the form of enteric coated granules, which are mixed with a finely-divided feed material, and fed to pigs on the basis of a regimen which provides massive introduction of the killed cells into the colon area. preferably, the immunizing feed is administered to the pigs at least once every 24 hours for a period of at least five days with each feeding providing

 claims   1. an oral preparation for increasing the resistance of swine  to swine dysentery infection, comprising enteric-coated  orally-administrable particulate material containing con  centrated killed cells of a virulent isolate of treponema  hyodysenteriae, said enteric coating being resistant to  dissolving in the swine stomach while dissolving in the  swine intestines to release said cells for immunizing action.   2. the oral preparation of claim 1, further characterized  by said killed cells of treponema hyodysenteriae being  prepared from isolate b204 (atcc no. 31212) or b234 (atcc  no. 31287).   3. the oral preparation of claim 1 or claim 2, further  characterized by said enteric coating being substantially  insoluble in water at a ph below 5.0 while being slowly  soluble at a ph of 5.8 to 6.2, the coatings on said pellets  requiring at least one hour to dissolve in water at 370c  and ph 6.0.   4. the oral preparation of any one of claims 1 to 3, charac  terized by also containing vitamins and minerals, thereby  forming an antigenic premix for administration to growing  pigs.     5. the method of increasing the resistance of swine to  dysentery infection, characterized by a sequence of  parenteral and oral administrations which are carried  out before the swine contract the infection, as follows:  (a) first parenterally administering to the swine an in  jectable cell concentrate containing killed cells of    virulent    isolate of treponema hyodysenteriae, at  least one injection being given per animal and each  injection containing at least 2 milligrams (dry  basis) of said cells;  and  (b) not less than 5 days after said animals have recei  ved the first of said parenteral injections, beginning  a series of oral administrations of enteric-coated  pellets containing concentrated killed cells of a  virulent isolate of treponema   hyodysenteriae,    said  oral administrations being given at least once every  24 hours for a period of at least 5 days, and each of  said oral administrations providing at least 3 milli  grams (dry basis) of said cells.   6. the method of claim 5, further characterized by said  killed cells of treponema hyodysenteriae being prepared  from isolate b204 (atcc no. 31212) or b234 (atcc no. 31287).      7. the method of claim 5 or claim 6, further characterized  by said parenteral injections comprising 2 injections  per animal with an interval of at least 4 days between  the days on which the injections are given, and each  parenteral injection providing at least 3 milligrams (dry  basis) of said cells of treponema hyodysenteriae.   8. the method of claim 5 or claim 6, further characterized  by each of said oral administrations providing at least  4 milligrams (dry basis) of said cells per animal and  being continued for at least 8 days at the rate of one  oral administration per animal per 24 hours.   9. the method of claim 5 or claim 6, further characterized  in that swine are growing pigs, and said oral administra  tions are started after the pigs have been weaned.
