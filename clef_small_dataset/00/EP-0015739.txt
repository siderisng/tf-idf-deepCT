<ABSTRACT>
a bearing assembly has two relatively rotatable members  (10, 12) formed with annular tongues (26, 27, 36, 37) which are  interleaved to form a labyrinth passageway seal between the  two members (10, 12).  at least a portion of the passageway is  defined by frusto conical surfaces on the annular tongues (26,  27, 36, 37) arranged to exert centrifugal force on any foreign  matter in the passageway upon relative rotation between the  two members (10, 12) so as to urge the foreign matter towards  the outer end of the passageway.  the labyrinth passageway  may comprise portions (53) which are flared in the direction to­ wards the outer end of the passageway, and the annular  tongues (26, 27, 36, 37) on one of the members arranged ec­ centric or non-circular so that the two members (10, 12) exert  a pumping action on any foreign matter in the flared portions  (53) of the labyrinth passageway upon relative rotation be­ tween the two members (10, 12).
