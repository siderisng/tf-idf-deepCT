<ABSTRACT>
a reel seat for use in mounting a fishing reel on a fishing  rod with the leg of the fishing reel held along the rod, said reel  seat comprising; a seat body (1) having a plurality of grooves  (12), a stationary socket fixed at one end of said seat body (1)  for receiving one end of the reel leg (a), a movable socket (3)  slidably mounted at the other end for receiving the other end  of the reel leg (a), and a control member (5) mounted for  movement of leaf spring (6), into and out of engagement with  the grooves (12).  in order to avoid an unsteady fixing a retainer (4) is slid­ ably mounted on the seat body (1) separately from the mov­ able socket (3).  the control member (5) and leaf spring (6) are  mounted on the retainer (4) for securing it on the seat body (1)  in a predetermined position when said leaf spring (6) is  engaged with a said groove (12).  connection means (7) are  provided between the control member (5) on the retainer (4)  and the movable socket (3) for longitudinal movement of the  movable socket (3) towards the stationary socket when the  control member (5) is operated to secure the retainer (4) in  position on the seat body (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
a reel seat for a fishing rod this invention relates to a reel seat for use in mounting a fishing reel on a fishing rod with the leg of the fishing reel held along the rod, said reel seat comprising: (a) a seat body for mounting longitudinally along the fishing rod said seat body having on its upper face at one end a plurality of grooves each of which extends laterally of the seat body and which are arranged longitudinally along the seat body, (b) a stationary socket fixed at one end of said seat body for receiving one end of the reel leg, (c) a movable socket which is positioned at the other end of said seat body and opposite to said stationary socket for receiving the other end of the reel leg, said movable socket being supported on said seat body so as to be slidable lengthwise thereof, (d) a leaf spring having an engagement portion for engagement with a said groove on said seat body and a control member mounted for movement of said leaf spring into and out of engagement with the grooves. generally this kind of reel seat holds the reel leg in such a manner that the reel leg is inserted at its one end into the stationary socket and sleeved at the other end by the slidably movable socket and the control member is operated to bias toward the seat body a retaining leaf spring supported to the movable holder so that the leaf spring is fitted at its bent end into a recess at the seat bo.dy, thereby retaining the movable socket to the seat body, thus holding the reel leg between both the holders. when fixing the reel leg by operating the control segment as aforeg9ing, the movable socket tends to move apart from the stationary socket. even if this does not occur, the leaf spring is often engaged with the incorrect groove so that the movable socket tends to move away from the stationary socket. as a result, the reel leg, even when it is supposedly fixed between the two sockets, is still relatively unsteady, this makes it difficult to correctly operate the fishing reel during the delicate operations involved in fishing. this invention is intended to overcome the above problems and it is an object of the invention to provide a reel seat capable of ensuring steady fixing of the reel leg between both the stationary and movable sockets. the present invention provides a retainer slidably mounted on the seat body separately from the movable socket, said control member and said leaf spring being mounted on said retainer for securing it on the seat body in a predetermined position when said leaf spring is engaged with a said groove, connection means being provide between the control member on the retainer and the movable socket for longitudinal movement of the movable socket towards the stationary socket when the control member is operated to secure the retainer in position on the

 claims   1. a reel seat for use in mounting a fishing reel on a fishing rod with the leg of the fishing reel held along the rod, said reel seat comprising; (a) a seat body (1) for mounting longitudinally along the fishing rod, said seat body (1) having on its upper surface at one end a plurality of grooves (12) each of which extends laterally of said seat body (1) and which are arranged longitudinally along the seat body (1).   (b) a stationary socket (2) fixed at one end of said seat body (1) for receiving one end of the reel leg (a), (c) a movable socket (3) which is   positionedzat    the other end of said seat body (1) and opposite to said stationary socket (2) for receiving the other end of the reel leg (a), said movable socket (3) being supported on said seat body (1) so as to be slidable lengthwise thereof, (d) a leaf spring (6) having an engagement portion (62) for engagement with a said groove (12) on said seat body (1) and a control member (5) mounted for movement of said leaf spring (6), into and out of engagement with the grooves (12),  characterized in that; ;  a retainer (4) is slidably mounted on the seat body (1) separately from the movable socket (3), said control member (5) and said leaf spring (6) being mounted on said retainer (4) for securing it on the seat body (1) in a predetermined position when said leaf spring (6) is engaged with a said groove (12), connection means (7,6) being provided between the control member (5) on the retainer (4) and the movable socket (3) for   longitudinal movement    of the movable socket (3) towards the stationary socket (2) when the control member (5) is operated to secure the retainer (4) in position on the seat body (1).   2. a reel seat according to claim 1 in which the leaf spring (6) is provided with a connection portion (63) connected to the movable socket (3) to provide said connection means (6) between the retainer (4) and the  movable socket (3), and wherein said leaf spring (6) has an upwardly curved portion disposed so that operation of the control member (5) to secure the retainer (4) in position with the engagement portion (62) of the leaf spring (6) engaged with a groove (12), produces longitudinal displacement of the connection portion (62) of the leaf spring (6) and the movable socket (3) connected thereto relative to the retainer (4) and towards the stationery socket (2).   3. a reel seat according to claim 1 in which the connection means comprises an interconnecting member (7) having at least one end connected to a respective one of said control member (5) on said retainer (4) and said movable socket (3) and disposed so that the movable socket (3) is longitudinally displaced relative to the retainer (4) towards the stationary socket (2) when the control member (5) is operated to secure the retainer (4) in position on the seat body (1).   4. a reel seat according to claim 3, wherein said inter-connecting member (7) for connecting said retainer (4) and movable socket   (3).comprises    a wire rod (7) and has its other end disposed for contact with the other of said movable socket (3) and control member (5) on said retainer (4).   5. a reel seat according to claim 3, wherein said inter-connecting member (7) comprises a torsion spring and is pivotally connected at one end thereof to said movable socket (3) and at the other end to said control member (5) on said retainer (4).    6. a reel seat according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said retainer (4) is positioned on the side of the movable socket (3) remote from the stationary socket (2) with the movable socket (3) positioned inbetween said  retainer (4) and said stationary socket (2) and the retainer (4) substantially adjacent said movable socket (3).   7. a reel seat according to claim 3 or claim 4, wherein said retainer (4) is positioned on the side of the stationary socket (2) remote from the movable socket (3) with the stationary socket (2) positioned inbetween said retainer (4) and said movable socket (3), said interconnecting member (7) extending between said retainer (4) and said movable socket (3) for movement of the movable (3) when the control member (5) is operated to secure said retainer (4) in position.
