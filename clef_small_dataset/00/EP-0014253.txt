<ABSTRACT>
a tablet containing at least two separate and discrete  volume portions one of which contains simethicone and the  other of which contains antacid.  a barrier separates the two  volume portions to maintain the simethicone out of contact  with the antacid and to prevent migration of the simethicone  from its volume portion of the tablet into the volume portion  containing the antacid, and vice versa.  the simethicone is  physically combined with the other ingredients of the tablet in  such a manner that the simethicone is available relatively  immediately for anti-foaming action, and its availability does  not depend upon the breakdown of a matrix.
