<ABSTRACT>
a method and system for the detection of plate clashÂ­ ing in disc refiners and provided herein.  the signal from  either an acoustic or vibration monitor (12) is processed  through a filter (14) which isolates those frequencies at  which a significant increase in signal level is known to  occur during a clash or are generated in association with  imminent or actual plate clashing.  the signal level of the  filtered data is compared with a threshold level (19) at  which protective action must be taken.  protection can be  automatically initiated by the plate clash detection system;  alternatively, it can be done manually by an operator, using  the detection system as a warning device.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and system for detecting pirate clashing in disc refiners this invention relates to a method and means for the detection of plate clashing in disc refiners. such refiners are'used for processing a material, e.g., a pulp suspension or a mixture of wood chips, water and chemicals. a disc refiner includes two discs at least one being rotatable relative to the other and forming between them a nairow, slot-shaped chamber. each disc is an assembly of wedge-shaped segments bolted or otherwise secured to the surface of a circular plate holder; the number of segments per disc is specific to the refiner type. the discs are so arranged that they are displaceable toward and away from one another for adjustment of the size of the chamber and the resulting pressure exerted on the material belng refined. under load, the refining pressure forces the material in the chamber into the form of a pad which prevents destructive contact between the two refiner plates. should the pulp pad break down, du-e either to process or to machine disturbances or machine failure, plate contact can occur until the pad reforms, the operator releases the plate pressure, or the attendant change in motor load causes the load protection circuits automatically to open the plates. the degree of damage incurred by the plates during the contact period (dependent npon the contact pressure and the period's duration detenines whether they thell have to be replaced with a new set. plate replacement is often necessary. the capacity of refining units is rapidly increasing and the cost of plate replacement is closely following this same trend. downtime on a single unit is giving rise to both larger process disturbances and production losses. at the present tine, no effective means exists tor anticipating an imminent clash, or for early detection once it occurs, that is suitable for industrial application. a refiner operator can, with careful attention hear the sound of metal-to-metal contact during a clash. his effectiveness, however, varies according to the resident environmental noise and the type of refiner casing. often, the operator is not near enough to the refiner to hear the emitted soujs and, if they are heard, it is difficult to initiate preventative action before plate damage occurs. general purpose electronic equipment is available for sound and vibration analysis. two categories of equipment which are available include on-line real-time signature analyzers, and machine protection systems. neither of these systems has, as yet, been used for plate clash protection, and both have serious drawback-s that limit their applicability in this area. on-line signature analyzers are used for the characterization of input signals. they suffer from both high cost and complexity. plate clashing develops rapidly; signature analyzers do not permit input data to be analyzed quickly enough to allow preventative action to be taken before destructive plate damage occurs. there is no facility for the automatic detection of the relevant phenomena nor for preventative action. machine protection systems do not have the selectivity required for singling out clash
