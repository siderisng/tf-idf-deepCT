<ABSTRACT>
an automatic gauge for measuring a person's foot and for giving an indication of a suitable size of footwear for the measured foot, the gauge comprising a first pair of members (15 and 38) of which the member (38) is movable towards and away from the member (15), a second pair of members (13 and 28) of which the member (28) is movable towards and away from the member (13), the foot (t) to be measured being placed between the members (15) and (38) and between the members (13) and (28), said gauge including electrical means (32, 33) and (34, 35) and circuit means (20) for processing the electrical output signals from the electrical means (32, 33) and 34, 35) and means (45 and 49) for displaying a size of footwear related to the spacing between the members of the pairs of members (15, 38 and 13, 28).

<DESCRIPTION>
automatic foot gauge this invention relates to a gauge for measuring a person's foot and for giving an indication of a suitable size of footwear for the measured foot. manually operable foot gauges are known in which the foot is placed between a heel stop and a slide member which give an indication of foot length, a flexible tape being passed over the foot to give an indication of foot width. such gauges depend for accuracy on the skill of the operator and measurements are taken when the person whose foot is being measured is sitting. consequently as there is no weight placed on the foot the measurements are taken with the foot in a relaxed condition and not with the foot supporting body weight. there is a need for a foot gauge which is automatic in use and not subject to the skill of an operator and which can be used to measure a foot whilst a person whose foot is being measured is standing. according to the present invention there is provided a gauge for measuring a person's foot and for giving an indication of a suitable size of footwear for the measured foot, comprising a first pair of members between which the heel and the toe ends of a foot can be placed, one of said first members being movable towards and away from the other member, a second pair of members between which the sides of a foot can be placed, one of said second members being movable towards and away from the other second member, electrical means responsive to the spacing between the members of said pairs of members, circuit means and means for displaying a size of footwear related to the spacing between the members of said pairs of members. preferably the movable member of said first pair of members is provided on a slide member movable along a slide provided on a base member and the movable member of said second pair of members is provided on a slide bar movable on the slide member in a direction at right angles to the direction of movement of the slide member. the other member of the first pair of members is preferably formed by a side wall of a recess provided in said base member and in which the foot is placed and the other member of the second pair of members is formed by a pivoted plate member connected to an onloff switch for the electrical means, in a preferred arrangement the electrical means responsive to the spacing between said first pair of members comprises a contact brush carried by the movable member of said first pair of members, a row of electrical contacts along watch the contact brush can be moved by the movable member of said first pair of members, an encoder electrically connected to all electrical contacts and a display means electrically connected to the encoder. preferably the electrical means responsive to the spacing between said second pair of members
