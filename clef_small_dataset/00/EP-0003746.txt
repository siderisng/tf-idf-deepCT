<ABSTRACT>
1.  plug fitting for rapid and detachable connection of a pipe duct (13) with externally smooth end region, particularly a duct of synthetic material, consisting of (a) a stub (1) with a sealing chamber (14) with inserted sealing ring (5) and axially displaceable spacer bush (4) arranged at the free end, (b) a housing (2) with an internal cone (25), (c) a collet (3) with an external cone (36), an internal cone (34) and with retaining teeth (32), wherein the housing (2) receives the collet (3) internally, (d) and an external cone (19) co-operating with the internal cone (34) of the collet (3) during the uncoupling of the pipe duct (13), characterized thereby, that (e) the external cone (19), which co-operates with the internal cone (34) of the collet (3) during the uncoupling of the pipe duct (13), is arranged at the housing-sided end region of the stub (1) and the end edge of the external cone (19) displays a slightly smaller diameter than the end edge of the internal cone (34), (f) and that the end region of housing (2) displays an elastic region (22) with end-sided annular collar (20), which during the plugging together slides enlargeably over the external cone (19) of the stub (1) and snaps into an annular groove (17) of the stub (1).
