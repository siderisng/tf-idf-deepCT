<ABSTRACT>
the process for the enzymatic transformation of a biological substrate in aqueous solution which, besides the substrate, contains concomitants capable of hydrophobic interaction, by means of an enzyme which acts on the substrate and which is inhibited by hydrophobic interaction with the concomitants, entails the enzymatic transformation being carried out in the presence of the hydrophobic concomitants, and the enzyme being bound by adsorption to a hydrophobically modified porous carrier with hydrophilic matrix.
