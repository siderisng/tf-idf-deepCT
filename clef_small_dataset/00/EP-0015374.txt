<ABSTRACT>
in this method, partial-frame information items stored at different positions are assembled to form a complete picture information in accordance with an instruction previously specified.  it is characterising of this method that, by means of a device, a superposition file is generated which contains individual partial frames of the partial frames to be superposed and/or instead of partial frames to be superposed, their respective identification and a superposition instruction, that all information items belonging to the superposition file are represented in an established coding and that the superposition file is transmitted to a superposition device by means of which the superposition can be carried out, the partial frames or at least their pixels needed for the superposition, which are not contained in the superposition file, being taken from the storage locations which are indirectly or directly specified in the respective identification items.  <image>
