<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for inner wall s clothing of industrial furnaces with a number of insulating blocks (1), each of which has a wavy-folded, possibly low-tempered insulating mat (2) from high-temperature-resistant mate rial, in particular ceramic fiber material, in the external fold portion support elements (3) are arranged, which are connected to the outside of the insulating block present mounting means (9) for separate attachment of each insulating block on the furnace wall (11, 12) ver ver verÂ¬, each insulating block (1) on its outer serte a base plate ( 5) with at least two webs (6) on opposite pages (6), such that adjacent ISO lier blocks are cartridge-like by means of these webs by means of these webs of fastening screws, and wherein the base plate (5) as a connecting element between the support elements ( 3) For the folded insulating mat (2) and the fastening means (9) serves. Further features relate to the closer configuration of the attic (9) with associated locking coals (15) and the insulating mat (2) with the support elements (3).
