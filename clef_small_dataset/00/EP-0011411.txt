<ABSTRACT>
the thermal energy storage material comprises at least  one hydrated compound (such as an inorganic salt) having a  transition temperature to the anhydrous or a less hydrated  form in the range 10 to 100°c and a hydrogel, comprising a  water-swollen cross-linked polymerformed by cross-linking a  synthetic hydrophilic polymer by a covalent cross-linking  mechanism, throughout which the compound is dispersed.   the hydrogel is made by reacting a water-soluble or water-­ dispersible synthetic hydrophilic polymer, which is preferably  linear and thermoplastic, with a cross-linking agent therefor in  an aqueous medium containing the hydrated compound.  the  hydrophilic polymer, the aqueous medium and the hydrated  compound are used in such amounts that the storage material  contains a major proportion, by weight, of the hydrated com­ pound and a minor proportion, by weight, of the cross-linked  polymer.
