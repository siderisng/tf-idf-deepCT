<ABSTRACT>
1.  mounting arrangement consisting of a supporting understructure and of partly overlapping facing (weather) boards fixed thereon, wherein a series of facing boards is arranged in vertical columns thus forming lapped joints with the boards above and below, wherein the columns are each continuously staggered with respect to one another by an amount given by half the difference between the height of the facing boards and the overlap within the columns, wherein the facing boards of neighboring columns partly overlap one another horizontally, with each facing board being introduced between the respective two adjoining facing boards of the neighboring columns, wherein vertical supports are used as a supporting understructure, which are arranged at a spaced relation resulting from the difference between the width of the facing boards and the lateral overlap of the neighboring columns, and wherein the facing boards, within all those areas in which one vertical edge of one facing boards meets upon a lower edge of another facing board, are secured to the supports with the aid of hooks which themselves are rotatable, but retained undetachably on the supports, characterized in that said supports (40) are provided with receiving openings (52) of drop-shaped cross-section whose longitudinal center line axes (53) extend vertically in relation to the longitudinal axis of said support, and that said hooks (70) are provided with hold fingers (72) which are in such a way adapted with their transition members (79) that said hook (70) with its hold finger (72) is capable of being introduced vertically in relation to the longitudinal axis of said support into a receiving opening (52), and of being undetachably locked in said receiving opening (52) of said support (40) by being turned by 90 degrees, parallel in relation to the longitudinal axis of said support.
