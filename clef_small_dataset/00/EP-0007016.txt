<ABSTRACT>
Voltage charger converter using a capacitor circuit for generating entire charge packets or of partial charge packets at selected spacing sites in a semiconductor substrate. Each line of a lei tungspaares connected to opposite sides of the Kon densator circuit (C; Cl, ​​Cr, CP) is selectively charged by a pair of charge transfer devices to a prior voltage, the charge transfer device with the Input of first and second the charge recycling CCD storage system are connected. In addition, voltages of a first and a second level are applied to each line ES line pair. By means of prior absorbing the one line of the line pair and by others of the voltage lying on the other line of the pipe pair of a first value according to a second value, a first charge packet is formed in a potential brain (27) of a first charge-exploiting CCD storage system. For injecting a duplicate of the first charge packet in a potential tray (29) of the two th system, similar voltages above the cone densator circuit (C) are placed in relation to the second system. On the other hand, in the second system, a charge packet is injected, which only represents a fraction of the first charge packet, then the like voltages Nos differ in that the voltage difference between the first and second amplitude is changed into a fraction, which the fraction corresponds to the desired charge packet. By prerequisite for the lines connected to the condensa scales (L, R), parasitic effects are made ineffective during charge injection.
