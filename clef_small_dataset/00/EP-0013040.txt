<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pure method of the production of coupling parts comprising an annular groove counterclockwise filled with a sealed wafer ring in which one first preforms an internal diameter sleeve increasing by step towards the Open end and the terminal portion of the sleeve so as to form the annular groove after intro-acting a sealing ring in the preformed sleeve and in which during preforming, the terminal portion of the preformed sleeve at temperature. Deformation and the rest of the preformed sleeve is cooled, the end portion of the preformed sleeve being cooled after post-information. The device according to the invention comprises a forming mandrel (2) whose front part comprises a refrigeration chamber (25) and whose rear portion comprises heating means (23), a post-information ring (45) movable radially and Axially and equipped with a refrigeration cham (47) and possibly a molding sleeve (5), a closing ring (31) equipped with heating means (33) and an introductory organ of the ring of the ring Sealing (37) movable radially and axially.
