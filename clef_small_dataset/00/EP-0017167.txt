<ABSTRACT>
A welding machine includes a control device (8, 9, 14, 33) to control a welding head (21) with respect to the horizontal X-and Y main axis and to rotate a vertical C axis around the welding head (21).The welding head (21) and a sensor (25) are attached to a rotatable rotor (29).A sinus cosine disassembly (61) is attached to the rotor (29) so that its shaft engages in the rotor gear (31).Deviations The sweat of the programmed route is detected by the sensor (25), which in turn causes the disassembly (61) drives a carriage mechanism.This causes moving the welding head into deviation axes XD and YD, so that the welding head from its programmed track moves to the desired correct, corrected distance.This program override correction is independent of the program and has no influence on the program.
