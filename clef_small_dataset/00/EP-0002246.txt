<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to compounds of the general formula wherein R₁ is hydrogen, alkyl with 1-6 carbon atoms or phenyl, R₂ hydrogen, alkyl with 1-6 carbon atoms, alkenyl with 2-6 carbon atoms, alkynyl with 2-6 carbon atoms or phenyl or R₁ and R₂ together with the carbon atom to which they are linked, form a cyclohexane ring which may optionally be mono-, di- or tri-alkyl with 1-3 carbon atoms, R₃ is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, trifluoromethyl or nitro and R₄ and R₅ representation of hydrogen or chlorine, with the implementation that R₁ and R₂ do not simultaneously mean hydrogen, as well as their preparation of the reactive derivatives of the corresponding acids by reaction with an oxime, optionally in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or from the corresponding phenoxyphenols by reaction with α- halogen or mesyloxy or tosyloxy-propane-carboxylic acid oxime esters, and weed control agents, D IE compounds of formula I include, as well as their use.
