<ABSTRACT>
shaped articles composed of polymers formed from  residues which are not melt processable characterised in that  the shaped article has been formed from a readily processable  melt of a copolymer containing said residues together with  in-chain temperature labile residues and has been subse­ quently heated to remove the labile constituents with recom­ bination of the resultant polymeric residues.  preferably the  processable melt should be in the form of an anisotropic melt  so that the shaped article may be in oriented form prior to  removal of the residues.  typically the shaped articles are  articles of thin section composed of p-hydroxybenzoic acid  residues.
