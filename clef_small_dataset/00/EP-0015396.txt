<ABSTRACT>
a method for increasing the life of the refractory li­ ning of a basic-refractory-lined vessel for the production  of steel by blowing oxygen into a ferrous melt from above  the surface of the melt, comprising:   (a) introducing into the vessel slag forming ingre­ dients, including dolomitic lime, such that the amount of  dolomitic lime exceeds the amount normally used, and   (b) introducing inert gas into the melt in such man­ ner as to cause intensive interaction between the slag and  the melt.  the preferred inert gas is argon.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates, in general, to a process for refining steel, and more specifically, to an improvement in the basic oxygen process wherein molten steel contained in a vessel is refined by top blowing oxygen into the melt, i.e. from above the melt surface. one problem frequently encountered in making basicoxygen steel is the limited life of the vessel's refractory lining. it is periodically necessary- therefore to reline the vessel, incurring loss of production and relining expense. prior methods of improving lining life have been to add dolomitic lime to the slag, see for example kristiansen et al, "the effects of operating variables on sulfur performance in a bof shop," 1976 open hearth proceedings, iss-aime, pp. 28-41. however, too much dolomitic lime renders the slag too viscous for efficient sulfur removal. accordingly, it is an object of this invention to increase the life of refractory linings for basic oxygen vessels. it is another object of this invention to increase the life of refractory linings for basic oxygen vessels without interfering with the ability to make steel having a low sulfur content. the above and other objects, which will readily be apparent to those skilled in the art, are achieved by the present invention, which comprises: a method for increasing the life of the refractory lining of a basic-refractory-lined vessel for the production of steel by blowing oxygen into a ferrous melt from above the surface of the melt, comprising: (a) introducing into the vessel, slag forming ingredients, including dolomitic lime, such that the amount of dolomitic lime exceeds the amount normally used, and (b) introducing inert gas into the melt in such manner as to cause intensive interaction between the slag and the melt. the term "inert gas" as used throughout the present specification and claims is intended to mean a gas other than oxygen having as many as possible of the following characteristics: low reactivity, low specific heat, absence of objectionable contaminents, and high density. the preferred inert gas is argon. however, if nitrogen contamination of the melt is not a problem, nitrogen or air may be used. other possible inert gases for use in practicing the invention include helium, neon, krypton, xenon, carbon dioxide, steam, ammonia, and mixtures thereof. however, argon, which may be either commercially pure or crude argon is by far the most preferable inert gas. the preferred method of introducing inert gas is through the oxygen lance admixed with oxygen. the iron charged to a basic oxygen furnace typically contains carbon, silicon, sulfur, and other impurities. the main purpose of the oxygen is to remove carbon and silicon from the melt. the silicon is oxidized to silicon dioxide which floats on the surface of the melt. the carbon is oxidized to carbon monoxide gas which escapes from the mouth of the vessel. slag forming ingredients, typically including high-calcium lime, are added to the melt to form a basic slag. the high-calcium lime, normally containing at least 90 percent by weight of cao, also removes sulfur

<CLAIMS>
what is claimed is:    1. a method for increasing the life of the refractory lining of a basic-refractory-lined vessel for the production of steel by blowing oxygen into a ferrous melt from above the surface of the melt, comprising:  (a) introducing into the vessel, slag forming ingredients, including dolomitic lime, such that the amount of dolomitic lime exceeds the amount normally used, and  (b) introducing. inert gas into the melt in such manner as to cause intensive interaction between the slag and the melt.    2. the method of claim 1 wherein the inert gas is introduced through the oxygen lance.    3. the method of claim 1 wherein the inert gas is introduced through a separate lance directed to impinge the inert gas against the surface of the melt.    4. the method of claim 1 wherein the sulfur content of the melt is higher than desired at the end of the oxygen blow, further comprising the step of:  (c) reblowing the melt with inert gas alone in such manner as to cause intensive interaction between the slag and the melt until the sulfur content is reduced to the desired level.     5. the method of claim 4 wherein at least one    sulfur-removing compound is added to the slag in the vessel  prior to the reblowing step.    6. the process of claims 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, wherein  the inert gas is argon.    7. the method of claims 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, wherein high calcium lime is introduced as a slag forming ingredient  in step (b) and the amount of dolomitic lime introduced in  step (b) is at least equal to that of the high-calcium lime  introduced.    8. the method of claim 7 wherein the amount of   - dolomitic    lime introduced in step (b) is at least two times  the amount of high-calcium lime introduced.    9. the method of claim 7 wherein the inert gas is argon.    10. the method of claim 8 wherein the inert gas is  argon.
