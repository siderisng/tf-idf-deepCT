<ABSTRACT>
a photographic process for forming designs on a support covered with a photographic emulsion.  on a support such as a fog film, a design is made using an indelible varnish, and the zones not covered with varnish are developed, and this takes place during a period corresponding to the degree of development which it is desired to obtain.  the relief parts of the indelible varnish are removed by means of an appropriate product and the emulsion which has remained untreated is redeveloped.  the invention permits the production of designs by photographic means, not exhibiting any relief parts, and consequently more stable and more resistant, especially to projectors, and the production of graphics which are specific to the aforementioned technique (see figure 3).  <image>
