<ABSTRACT>
a packaging machine for loading a group of primary  packages such as bottles through the open ends of an open  ended sleeve container (c) includes a fixed horizontally  disposed base plate (50) over which a plurality of transverse  parallel spaced apart metering bars (51) are movable in  spaced relation to the base plate so that an open ended  sleeve carton disposed in the spaces between the metering  bars is slidable over the base plate together with fixed guide  means (86-89) (93-96) disposed alongside the base plate for  receiving primary packages from an infeed conveyor, the  fixed guide means being disposed at an acute angle to the  path of movement of the metering bars so that primary  packages are supplied by the fixed guide means into the  spaces between the metering bars and thence into the open  ends of the sleeve type containers disposed therebetween.
