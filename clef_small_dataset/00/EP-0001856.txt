<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for the continuous generation of high-grade producer gas and water gas from solid and high-boiling liquid fuels which does not require external heat storage and is especially useful for the operation of internal combustion engines where the load undergoes frequent changes, whereby seen from the direction of the process reaction there is provided two, essentially parallel-running fuel flows (1, 2), characterized by the features that - the fuel of the first flow (1) is subjected to the successive processes of drying, at least partial distillation and gas production in the reaction space (3), - the fuel on the second flow (2) is used to indirectly heat the fuel of the first flow (1), - at least part of working gas (20) produced in the first fuel flow (1) and at least a part of the burned gas (12) in the second fuel flow (2) are both employed as heat carriers in closed circulation systems, and that further - at least a part of the water vapor (15) formed by the drying and distillation processes is fed back into the gas production zone (8) of the first fuel flow (1), either in the liquid or gas phase.
