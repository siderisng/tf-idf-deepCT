<ABSTRACT>
an oil burner unit comprises an oil pump and a fan which  are both driven by the same motor.  the pump (3) is of the kind  which begins to operate only above a predetermined critical  speed.  when starting the unit, the motor is first energised by a  first current supply circuit having an impedence (6) and thus  operated at a reduced number of revolutions at which the  pump (3) is out of operation but the fan (2) is working to  ventilate the combustion chamber.  after the lapse of a pre­ determined period of time the number of revolutions is  increased to cause the pump to operate, whereby the com­ bustion can begin.  the changeover is achieved by means of a  time delay device which closes a second circuit to increase the  motor speed and thereby cause the pump to deliver oil.
