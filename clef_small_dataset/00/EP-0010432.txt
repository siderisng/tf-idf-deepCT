<ABSTRACT>
this invention concerns a stable 'b' stage plastics  polymer material, a method of producing said material, and a  laminate comprising at least one layer of said material and at  least one layer of a metal foil.  the plastics polymer material  comprises the reaction product of the following components:  (a) a phenolic based resin: (b) at least one inorganic and/or  further organic material; and (c) an acid catalytic curing sys­ tem; the components being selected such that the reaction  between them ends at the 'b' stage.  the plastics polymer materials according to this inven­ tion are flexible and have improved stability and flame retar­ dant properties over the known 'b' stage phenolic based mat­ erials.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "improvements in or relating to phenolic matepiais". the present invention relates to a stable 'b' stage plastics polymer material, to a method of producing said material, and to a laminate comprising at least one layer of said material. thenolic resin based plastics materials evolve in three stages which are connected with the degree nf condensation. firstly, there is the resol or 'a' age wherein the material is a soluble fluid which retains a large quantity of water which is generated during condensation, the material being only slightly che@ically crosslinked. secondly, there is the resitol or 'b' stage wherein the material becomes a flexible ho@@geneous mass being partly chemically cross-linked, and finally there is the resite or 'c' stage wherein the material is a fully chemically crcss-linked thermoset. it is well known that phenolic resin based plastics materials have good fire retardent properties and are generally heat resistant. such known compositions, however, are normally rigid (that is in the 'c' stage) and are extremely brittle thus limiting their scope and useful application. those known flexible phenolic materials (that is those in the 'b' stage and occasionally in the 'c' stage) exhibit poor stability and much lover resistance to fire when compared with the rigid ls and are, therefore, seldom used. by practice of the present invention there may be provided a material, and a method of manufacturing s-e, which has all the advantages of the known rigid phenolic based materials but which is still flexible and yct capable of being rigidified by the application or ffi if so desired. according to the present invention there is provided a stable 'b' stage plastics polymer materials characterized in that it comprises the reaction product of the following components: (a) a phenolic based resin; (b) at least one inorganic and/or further organic material; and (c) an acid catalytic curing system; the components being selected such that the reaction between them ends at the 'b' stage. according to the present invention there is also provided a method of producing a stable 'b' stage plastics polymer material in accordance with the present invention, characterized in that a mixture of a phenolic based resin and at least one inorganic and/or further organic material is formed and an acid catalytic curing system is subsequently added to the mixture of phenolic based resin and at least one inorganic and/or further organic material, and the resulting mixture is allowed to react to form a stable 'b' stage material. typically, the phenolic based resin is a licuid phenolic resin, preferably of the resol type. the further organic material may, for example, comprise at least one polymeric material other than the phenolic resin. ¯¯suitably, the at least one other polymeric material is any material capable of effecting a copolymerisation with the phenolic based resin, for example it can be an epoxy resin. epoxy resins which may be used include materials (resins) produced by reacting epichlorohydrin with bisphenol-a and these materials are preferably used in a ratio of 1 part by weight
