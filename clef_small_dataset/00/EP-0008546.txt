<ABSTRACT>
1.  auto-blowing switch having a tight enclosure (10) filled with a high dielectric strength gas, like sulfur hexafluoride, inside which are located a pair of separable contacts (16, 24, 54), a coil (28) for generating a magnetic field blasting in rotation an arc (52) drawn between the separated contacts and a device of gas compression and blasting comprising a movable wall (24, 56) and a fixed wall (18) delimiting a chamber (26) of variable volume to puff the gas filling the chamber (26) by the movable wall (24, 56) displacement, characterized in that said movable wall (24, 56) shaped as a conducting disk independent of the movable contact assembly of the switch, is biased when the switch is closed, in inactive position of maximum spacing of the fixed wall (18) and of joining to the coil (28) front side, located outside said chamber (26), the coil (28) generating, when the switch is opened, on the one hand an electrodynamic repulsion force of the conducting disk (24, 56) by thomson effect to compress the gas contained in the chamber (26) and on the other hand said magnetic field blasting in rotation the arc (52) extending inside the chamber (26).
