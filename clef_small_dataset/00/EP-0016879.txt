<ABSTRACT>
a corner lock carton exhibiting improved lock retention  includes a base panel (3), a pair of walls panels (5, 7), and a  locking flap panel (13) joined to one of the wall panels.  the oth­ er wall panel includes a locking slit (29, 31, 33) formed inwardly  thereon to receive the locking flap panel.  the slit has a vertical  segment (29), a horizontal segment (33), and an angled seg­ ment (31) connecting the vertical and horizontal segments; the  ends of the angled segments being disposed at an angle of 40°  to the vertical segment.  the flap panel (13) includes a lock  member (17) having a first edge portion (19) aligned parallel to  the vertical segment of the slit when the carton is erected and  a second edge portion (21) disposed at an angle of 45° to the  first edge portion.  when the wall panels (5,7) are erected, the  lock member (17) is disposed through the slit, and the second  edge portion (21) of lock member engages the slit at a point  adjacent the juncture of the vertical segment (29) and the  angled segment (31) to securely interlock the flap panel and  slit together.
