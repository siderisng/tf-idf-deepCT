<DESCRIPTION>
heat resistant composition and method i'or preparation thereof this invention relates to heat resistant and thermally insulating compositions. according to the present invention there is provided a heat resistant, thermally illsulating composition characterised in that the composition comprises inorganic filler, a light weight, organic filler, a silicate binder and a component which swells or intumesces when subjected to heat. the above materials are chosen so as to give rise to a composition which is light weight and can be manufactured in slab form for use as, for instance, cores for doors and panels. the composition can also be moulded into virtually any shape. the present invention also provides a method for making a composition in accordance with the present invention, the method including the steps of forming an aqueous slurry in which the silicate is present at least partially in a dissolved form and allowing the slurry to set. the inorganic filler is preferably pulverised fly ash (pfa). typically this material has a water content of 208 and a chemical analysis as follows: sio2 60% 2 3 278 trace metals 11.7% water solubles 1.38 the particles of the pulverised fly ash are hollow, spherical particles obtained as a product of the burning of pulverised fuel and are known as bulk cenospheres. other inorganic light weight fillers with good fire resistant properties can be used in addition to or instead of the bulk cenospheres, examples being expanded perlite and expended vermiculite. tle light weight organic filler may be, for instance, wood waste, sawdust, shastings, chippings up to about 3 rtm diameter, expanded polystyrene beads (preferably of from 2 to 3 mm diameter and average density 15 to 29 3 kgs/m3), scrap cork granules with diameter up to about 3 mm, granulated scrap urethane foam with diameter up to about 3 mm and granlalated scrap expanded polystyrene with diameter up to about 3 mm. the incorporation of the organic light weight filler in the matrix of the composition of the invention means that under fire conditions the organic material will "burn out" leaving behind an insulating honeycomb comprising the inorganic material. the silicate binder is preferably an alkali metal silicate and more preferably sodium silicate. with the latter the preferred weight ratio of sio2 to na2o is between 2.5 and 3.3. the choice of silicate used depends on the degree of flexibility required for the final product and also the desired setting rate which will suit the particular manufacturing process involved. the component which intumesces when subjected to heat is preferably raw perlite ore. a typical chemical analysis of such ore is as follows: sio2 74% a12 15% k2o 4% na2o 3% cao 1% trace metals 1% h20 2% the presence of the in tumescent material means that when the composition is subjected to high temperatures as in fire situations it intumesces and therefore the composition will expand. where the composition is, for instance, the core of a door and is subjected to fire conditions on one side of the door the
