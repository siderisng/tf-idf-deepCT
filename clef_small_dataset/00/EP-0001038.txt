<ABSTRACT>
1.  method of making a silicon mask wherein on one surface of a wafer-shaped and planar silicon substrate (20) a thin silicon layer (22) is produced whose concentration of conductivity-determining impurities is higher than in the substrate (20), wherein recesses (28) are selectively etched into the surface of the substrate (20) opposite the silicon layer (22) of higher doping, and wherein from the surface of thin silicon layer (22) of higher doping, in accordance with the desired mask pattern, holes (14, 31) are selectively etched down to the recesses produced by the substrate etching, characterized in that prior to the etching of the mask pattern into the thin silicon layer (22) of higher doping the recesses (28) are produced with means which attacks silicon of low doping concentration quicker than highly doped silicon, the substrate material being etched fully through to the thin silicon layer (22) of higher doping.
