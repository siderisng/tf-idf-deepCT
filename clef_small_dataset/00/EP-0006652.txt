<ABSTRACT>
opening arrangements for packing containers are  realized inter alia in the form of a portion of the wall of the  packing container delimited by means of an opening  indication line which portion is opened with the help of a  tearing thread.  the application of the tearing thread along  a nonrectilinear opening indication line is difficult and  up to now it has not been possible to realize it automati­ cally in the rapid manufacture of packing containers from  e. g.  a moving material web.  in accordance with the inven­ tion an opening arrangement is now provided wherein an  openable part (6) of the container wall, limited by a curved  opening indication line (5′), is opened with the help of a  tearing thread (7) which extends rectilinearly between two  points on the opening indication line (5′).  the tearing  thread (7) is applied so that on opening it follows and  breaks up the material of the packing container along the  curved opening indication line (5′).  the possibility of  applying the thread rectilinearly makes the opening  arrangement especially suitable for application in the  manufacture of packing containers from a moving material  web, since the thread can be applied at high speed parallel  with the direction of the web.

<DESCRIPTION>
opening arrangement for packing containers the present invention relates to an opening arrangement for packing containers of the type wherein a part of the packing container wall which is openable by means of a tearing thread is limited by an opening indication line. it is customary for an opening arrangement in a packing container wall of paper or laminated plastic material to be formed with the help of a weakening line arranged in the wall, which extends around an openable portion. when the packing container is to be opened, this is usually done in that the openable portion, delimited by the weakening line, is pressed into the package, whereupon it may be torn off. this type of opening arrangement is customary in packing containers e.g. for washing powders or flakes. in packing containers e.g. for liquid contents the opening arrangement described is not suitable. in packages for liquid contents other solutions have therefore been tried and a common one among these consists in providing the packing container wall with a punched-out hole which is covered by a tear-off tearing strip. however, this opening arrangement is both expensive and more complicated and moreover provides inferior impermeability to liquid and gas which is a disadvantage in particular in the case of sensitive foodstuffs. a desirable solution consists therefore in modifying the firstmentioned opening arrangement in such a manner that the openable portion of the packing container wall can be opened without having to be pressed into the packing container and without the risk of splashing or spilling. this modification can take the form of the opening arrangement being provided with a tearing thread applied along the weakening line, one end of which is accessible from the outside of the package and by means of which the connection of the openable part of the wall with the remaining packing container wall can be broken. an opening arrangement comprising a tearing thread of this type functions very well but will be somewhat complicated to manufacture, since the application with sufficient accuracy of the tearing thread is time-consuming and difficult, especially when the tearing thread is to be applied along a curved opening indication line. in the mechanical, rapid manufacture of packing containers from a moving material web therefore it has not been possible up to now to apply the tearing thread with sufficient accuracy. it is an object of the present invention to provide an opening arrangement for packing containers which is not subject to the abovementioned disadvantages. it is a further object of the present invention to provide an opening arrangement which is simple and fairly inexpensive and which moreover is easily openable. it is a further object of the present invention to provide an opening arrangement with a tearing thread which is easy to apply also in the rapid, automatic manufacture of packing containers, especially from moving material webs. these objects have been achieved in accordance with the invention in that an opening arrangement for packing containers of the type wherein a

claims   1. an opening arrangement for packing containers of the type wherein a part (6) of the packing container wall which is openable by means of a tearing thread (7) is limited by an opening indication line (5'), c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the opening indication line (5') is curved or arched, that the tearing thread (7) extends substantially rectilinearly between two points on the opening indication line, and that the tearing thread is firmly attached to the packing container wall at least at one of the said points.   2. an opening arrangement in accordance with claim 1,   char    a c t e r i z e d i n that the tearing thread (7) in packing containers which are manufactured from web-like material runs parallel with the direction of the web.   3. an opening arrangement in accordance with claim 1, c   ha    r a c t e r i z e d i n that the tearing thread (7) is fixed in a detachable manner to the surface layer of the packing container wall facing towards the inside of the packing container.   4. an opening arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the opening indication line (5') constitutes a sealing line between two wall parts (3, 1) forming the packing container.   5. an opening arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the one end of the tearing thread (7) extends through the opening indication line (5') and is located outside the packing container.   6. an opening arrangement in accordance with claim 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the end of the tearing thread (7) extending outside the packing container is connected to a part of the packing container material in the shape of a tearing tab (8).    7. an opening arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the front end of the tearing thread located outside the packing container meets the opening indication line (5') at an obtuse  angle.   8. an opening arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the openable part of the wall of the packing container is in the form of a turn-up lid (6) which is pivotable about a straight line which extends between the end points of the opening indication line (5') and delimits the openable lid part (6) from an adjoining part of the packing container wall (3).   9. an opening arrangement in accordance with claim 8, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the said line coincides with the straight line along which the tearing thread (7) is detachably fixed to the packing container wall.
