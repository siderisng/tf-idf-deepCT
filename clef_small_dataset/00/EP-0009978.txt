<ABSTRACT>
in an integrated circuit device comprising a heat sink  (3), an insulating layer (4) formed on the heat sink conduc­ tor films (5a,5b) disposed on the insulating layer (4) in a  desired pattern, and circuit elements such as semi­ conductors connected between the conductor films to con­ stitute a desired circuit, the heat sink has fibers of carbon  or the like embedded in a metal matrix of copper or the  like.  the fibers have a thermal expansion coefficient sub­ stantially equal to or lower than that of the insulating layer.   with the above construction, heat generated in the circuit  elements can sufficiently be transferred to the heat sink by  way of the thin insulating layer and distortion caused by  the heat generation in the interface between the heat sink  and the insulating layer can be minimized to thereby pre­ vent damage of the insulating layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
iicegrat".d circuit device this invention relates generally to integrated circuit devices and more particularly to an integrated circuit device with circuit elements which generate a large amount of heat. a recent development of semiconductor technology has been to develop not only a power module in which large-capacity thyristors, transistors and the like, along with their driver circuit elements, are arranged on a single substrate but also a hybrid ic in which a plurality of circuit elements are arranged on a single substrate. the integrated circuit device of the type mentioned above usually comprises a metal heat sink, an insulating layer disposed on the metal heat sink, a number of conductor films for forming a desired circuit network on the insulating layer, and semiconductor elements and the like circuit elements connected between the conductor films. the heat sink and the conductor film are made of electrically conductive materials. in general, copper is used for the heat sink and aluminum, copper or silver is widely used for the conductor film. the it is/practice that the insulating layer is made of when alumina and, / incorporating the insulating layer into the device, an alumina plate with its one surface metalized is placed on the heat sink and bonded thereto by soldering. in the integrated circuit device, heat generated in the circuit elements during its operation is transferred to the insulating layer and then dissipated from the heat sink. to obtain better heat dissipation characteristics, in some applications, a heat sink is used having its surface coated with nickel and an insulation layer is used with its surface facln the heat sink coated with copper. as a prior art concerning the above expedient, one may refer to usp 3,469,148, for example. the construction of this prior device art/was, however, insufficient to dissipate heat generated in circuit elements. therefore, this prior device art/is somewhat troublesome because of bad dissipation of heat generated in the circuit elements. this tendency is aggravated especially when semiconductor elements which generate a large amount of heat are used as the circuit elements. of troubles encountered in the prior art, there is mentioned herein a disadvantage that the semiconductor elements used as the circuit elements are overheated, resulting in increase in leakage current of the semiconductor elements and decrease in blocking voltage of the same. therefore, it is of great significance to effectively dissipate heat generated in the circuit elements for the sake of suppressing degradation in performance of the integrated circuit device. one reason for the insufficient heat dissipation characteristics of the prior art integrated circuit device is such that the thickness of the insulating layer typically amounting up to 500 to 800 um is too thick. if the insulating layer might be reduced to the order of thickness of 200 to 300 vm, the heat dissipation characteristics would be improved considerably. is if the thickness of the insulating layer/reduced to meet the heat dissipation characteristics, arise in however, additional problems/that the insulating layer will yield owing to thermal distortion
