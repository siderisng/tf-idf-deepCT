<ABSTRACT>
a photoelectric docking device for remotely positioning a  first member (12) relative to a second member (10), having a  point light source (16) coupled to the first member, which is  directed to focus a narrow beam of light on a photosensor (14)  fixedly connected to the second member.  the photosensor is  responsive to the reception of light from the point light source  on the first member to provide electrical outputs representaÂ­ tive of the relative position of the point source with respect to  the photosensor in three-dimensional space (48, 50).  means  are further provided for reducing the intensity of the light  source proportionally with the distance of the light source  from the photosensor to prevent the photosensor from  becoming saturated when in close proximity to the light  source.
