<ABSTRACT>
a coupling thread structure for percussion drill ele­ ments including a rod (10) having an external thread (14),  and a sleeve (24) having an internal thread (26) with the  threads, when the sleeve and rod are coupled, having  abutting (16) and non-abutting (18) flanks and with the  flanks being joined by bottom (22) and crest (20) portions,  wherein the threads have at least two starts; the abutting  flanks (16) are substantially straight along their whole  abutting contact portions (cl) and form an angle of be­ tween 10° and 25°, preferably 15° to 20°, with the drill  axis; the pitch angle of the threads is in the range 9° to 20°,  preferably 11° to 16°; the crest portions (20) are sub­ stantially straight and intersect the abutting flank (16)  portions at a well defined edge; the non-abutting flanks (18)  have a flank angle which is considerably greater than that  of the abutting flanks (16); the flank angle of the non-­ abutting flanks (18) is in the range 50° to 80°, preferably  65° to 75°, with respect to the drill axis; and the bottom  portions (22) of the threads (14,26) are curved.
