<ABSTRACT>
a 3-terminal totally integrated demultiplexing photodi­ ode is disclosed wherein information present simultaneously  at two wavelengths can be developed into two separate cur­ rents available at the three terminals.  two quaternary n-type  layers (103 and 105) of indium gallium arsenide phosphide  having unequal bandgaps and each having a pn junction are  separated by a layer (104) of n-type indium phosphide the  device is oriented so as to present the incoming radiation first  to the quaternary layer having the larger bandgap and then to  the quaternary layer having the lower bandgap.  one of the  contacts (111) is attached to the top layer (106) of n-type indi­ um phosphide, a second contact (112) is attached to a con­ tral p-type region (110) established in the top layer of indium  phosphide and penetrating through to the top quaternary lay­ er, and the third contact (113) is connected to the indium  phosphide substrate (101).  alternatively the third contact  may be connected to a p-type outer region (301) that extends  through all of the layers thus providing a planar structure.  by  reversing the dc potential applied to the junctions in the quat­ ernary layers a dual-wavelength light emitting diode is pro­ vided.
