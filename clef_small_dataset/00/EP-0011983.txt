<ABSTRACT>
in a regenerative rotodynamic machine, a portion of a  disc-like impeller (11) adjacent the impeller periphery extends  radially through an annular chamber (13) in the machine cas­ ing concentric with the impeller, thereby dividing said  chamber into two annular side channels (13a, 13b) one on  each side of the impeller.  the portion of the impeller lying in  the annular chamber has scooped out annular cavities or  recesses in its sides in which are disposed rings of  aerodynamic blades (18a, 18b) and fluid flow passing around  the annular chamber from an inlet to an outlet is caused to  circulate repeatedly, flowing radially outward through the  blading in the impeller cavities and radially inward in the  annular side channels alongside the impeller outside the  impeller cavities.  shroud rings (16a, 16b) at the blade tips  form cores around which this circulation takes place.  the  blades are cast intagrally with the impeller disc or with the  shroud rings.  the aerodynamic blades are designed so that  the angle between the entry and exit flows of each blade is  greater than 90°.
