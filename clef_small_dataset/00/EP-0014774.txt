<ABSTRACT>
apparatus and method for transmission of information  from locations spread over a large area to a central point (i)  where data processing takes place, all locations and said cen­ tral point having a normally operating telephone connection,  wherein each location (ii) is equipped with a memory for the  temporary recording of the information to be transmitted and  in which each memory is equipped with a switching device  (4), which can connect the memory, with the telephone line (1)  to the central point with simultaneous blocking of the tele­ phone apparatus (5) present in that location as long as the  memory is connected, which switching devices can be acti­ vated from the central point via the telephone line by a special  signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus and method for the transmission of data (information) the invention relates to an apparatus and a method for the transmission of management data (information) from fue3 stations or depots spread over a large area to a central point, where data processing takes place, all fuel stations on depots just as the central points having a normally operating telephone connection. an important example of locations spread over a sarge area -s a network of service stations for road traffic in a district. such a network may comprise many dozens of stations, which are managed and must be supplied from a central point, the district office. many data play a role here, such as stocks of the various products, quantities delivered, distribution of customer calls over a given time, money received, etc. such data are generally entered on lists and are very important for efficient management. it may also provide a sounder basis for the optimization of the supply. it is essential that the data should be available at a central point and this can be done by having normal telephone calls between each fuel station or depot and the central point. however, this is a very digressive way. the apparatus and method according to the invention remove these difficulties and the invention provides the means with which these data can be transmitted in an effective, inexpensive and flexible way. the invention therefore is characterized in that a switching device is present at the fuel station or depot just as at the central point, said switching device upon activation, connects said relevant fuel station or depot with the central point and data processing device by way of the telephone line, whereas a simultaneous blocking of the telephone apparatus at the central point and at the fuel station or depot exists, as long as the data processing device is linked with the fuel station or depot and in that each fuel station or depot is equipped with a memory for the temporary recording of information to be transmitted to the central point, whereas said memory is connected with a receiver at the central point through the telephone line by way of said switching device to be activated by means of an activating device related to said fuel station or depot, and in that further a signal element is present at the fuel station or depot, said element swerving to reset the switching device of the fuel station or depot after finishing reading out, and in that a signal element being present at the central point, said element before reading out acting upon said signal element at the fuel station or depot by way of the telephone line by means of a special signal, and a reset device for the switching device at tb,ecentral point after reading out also being present. said special signal may be a signal to which the normal telephone apparatus is not sensitive. considerable advantages are achieved with this apparatus. use is made of existing telephone lines with which

 claims   1. an apparatus for the transmission of management data (information) from fuel stations or depots spread over a large area to a central point where data processing takes place, all fuel stations or depots just as the central point having a normally operating telephone connection, characterized in that a switching device is present at the fuel station or depot just as at the central point, said switching device, upon activation, connects said relevant fuel station or depot with the central point and data processing device by way of the telephone line, whereas a simultaneous blocking of the telephone apparatus at the central point and at the fuel station or depot exists,  as long as the data processing device is linked with the fuel station or depot and in that each fuel station or depot is equipped with a memory for the temporary recording of information to be transmitted to the central point, whereas said memory is connected with a receiver at the central point through the telephone line by way of said switching device to be activated by means of an activating device related to said fuel station or depot, and in that further a signal element is present at the fuel station or depot, said element serving to reset the switching device of the fuel station or depot after finishing reading out, and in that a signal element being present at the central point, said element before reading out acting upon   said aignal    element at the fuel station or depot by way of the telephone line by means of a  special signal,  and a reset device for the switching device at   thpntral    point after reading out also being present.   2. apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterized in that said signal device for activating the switching device at the fuel station or depot is a tone detector, supplying a pulse to the processing device, whereupon data are read out.   3. apparatus as claimed in claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the signal device at the central point is a tone generator.      apparatus    as claimed in claims 1, 2 or 3 characterized in that the data processing device is a computer, resetting the switching device at the central point after finishing reading-out.   5. method for transmitting management-data (information) from fuel stations or depots spread over a large area to a central point, where said data are processed, whereas normal telephone calls at the central point and at the fuel stations or depots are possible characterized in that, if it is desired to transmit data, a connection is made between the central point and the relevant fuel station or depot by way of the telephone line with simultaneous blocking the normal existing telephone connection between the central point and the fuel station or depot as long as the connection exists by way of switching devices being present at the central point and at the fuel station or depot, and in that the switching device at the fuel station or depot is activated by a related activation device and the switching device at the central point by a related activation device,   and in that a signal device, being present at the central point acts through the telephone line upon the activation device of the fuel station or depot by means of a special signal, and in that further a memory, being present at the fuel station or depot,  is read out and the switching device at the fuel station or   depot zfter    being read out is reset by means of a signal element relating to the fuel station or depot and further the switching device at the central point is reset by means of a signal device relating to the central point.
