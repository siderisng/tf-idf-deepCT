<ABSTRACT>
a multiplex information handling system has a plur足 ality of receivers and transmitters connected by a signal  bus and a power bus.  timing of transmitted data is con足 trolled by issuing clock pulses cp at intervals and so that  these clock pulses can be recognised they are made shorter  in duration than any other pulses transmitted.  a synchron足 ising pulse (sp) fronts each transmission of data and so  this can be recognised this pulse is made longer than any  other pulse in the transmission.  after a transmission, the  signal bus is held high for a period to prevent further trans足 mission so that switching of loads consequent upon the first  transmission does not affect these further transmission.   noise suppression circuitry is also provided.
