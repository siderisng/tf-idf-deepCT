<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for translating rotary to linear motion using  cylindrical means in the form of a shaft or cylinder with  helical grooves, usually having a thread profile.  for obtaining good efficiency and large gear ratio, i. e.   small linear movement per revolution, the apparatus has  been made up from an outer cylinder (1) with a rear  transverse portion (5) and a forward outer opening (3)  through which an inner cylinder (11) is unrotatably displaceable.  the inner cylinder (11) has on its inside a helix groove  (12) or thread, in which at least one profiled roller (30, 32, 40)  with circular ridges (33) engages.  the roller or rollers are  eccentrically disposed at one end of a drive shaft (23),  rotatably but axially undisplaceably mounted (8) in the outer  cylinder (1) at its other end.  when the shaft (23) rotates, the  rollers (31, 32, 40) roll or follow in the grooves (12) of the  inner cylinder (11) and displace the inner cylinder in the outer  cylinder.
