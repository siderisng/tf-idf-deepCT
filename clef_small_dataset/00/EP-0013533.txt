<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for high-frequency welding of sheets of material between two electrodes which are to be arranged on both sides of the sheets of material, in particular the welding apparatus that can be displaced on a table supporting the sheets of material, is to be improved in such a way that it is capable of being universally employed, that is to say permits the economically justifiable processing of conventional films and insulating sheets, and this while increasing the welding speed and improving the weld quality.  it is proposed for this purpose to equip at least one of the electrodes (e, f) with parts (20, 21, 22) that can be produced by rolling on a plane generated by the sheets of material formed by woven sheets.  in addition, or instead, the electrodes are to be arranged exchangeably with at least one pair of heating bars (30) or the like, which is mounted on both sides of the track of travel of the sheets of material formed from four plastic sheets and roughly parallel to these sheets of material, and of which the heating bars are mounted under pressure capable of being moved against one another, and the welding press is to have a housing with a passage slot for the plastic sheets.  moreover, it has proved to be favourable for a device for inserting stud weld fasteners (50) or the like into the sheets of material (3) to be arranged upstream of the pressing or welding region in such a way that the stud weld fasteners jointly penetrate at least two mutually overlapping sheets of material or woven sheets and form a protective layer covering the penetration through hole produced at the end of the welding region on both sides of the woven sheets welded to one another, the two protective layers being connected by a stud-like neck.  the process step according to the invention of relevance here consists in connecting the woven sheets, before they are welded together, by means of the stud weld fasteners or the like transverse to the surfaces of the woven fabric, and to melt a protective layer during the welding process by deforming a part of the stud weld fastener, which protective layer preferably consists of the material of an adjacent surface layer of the woven sheet.  <image>
