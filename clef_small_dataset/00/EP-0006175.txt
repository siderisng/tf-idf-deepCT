<ABSTRACT>
improvements in the coffee machines which brew coffee  beverages from pods of ground coffee consisting of an assem­ bly comprising a baffle (3) carrying member (1) and a filter (4) so  shaped that they tightly clamp the periphery (5) of a pod (p), that  they define an upper chamber (c) and a lower chamber (c′)  wherein the pod (p) may expand; a pod (p) having specified  coffee contents, thickness, diameter, manufacturing pressure; a  fitter (4) of a specified set of filters.  said improvements provide in  a time period from 20 to 40 seconds beverage volumes varying  according to the selected filter and containing a fraction of  aromatic substances ranging from 22% to 26% of the total  extractable fraction (the sole figure is referred to).
