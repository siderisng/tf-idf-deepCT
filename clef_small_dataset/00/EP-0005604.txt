<ABSTRACT>
a surface cleaning machine, of the kind in which  abrasive grit (6) is projected at high velocity against a surface  (1) to be cleaned.  the machine has an upper hopper (12) to  receive grit carried by rebound and air flow from the zone (4)  being cleaned.  adjustable openings (26) provide for controllable  air exhaust upstream of the upper hopper (12) which  has a controllable outlet (27, 27a) through which grit falls in  the form of a curtain (6a) into a main, lower hopper (11).  air  is drawn into the main hopper (11) through a controllable  inlet (28, 28a) and flows through the curtain (6a) to remove  dirt from the falling grit.  the angle of the blast wheel (3) can  be varied, to vary the angle of impact of the projected grit (6)  on the surface (1) in the cleaning zone (4).
