<ABSTRACT>
the barbecue has a framework in the shape of a wheelbarrow comprising two frames a and b pivoted together at 6.  two grates (12, 13) are mounted on the rear frame b in the region of the back and bottom of the wheelbarrow.  with the framework in the wheelbarrow configuration, grate 12 may be used as a dutch oven.  by urging the free end of the shafts (2) downwardly, the two frames a and b relatively pivot to a position in which the end (2a) of the shaft bears on the ground.  the two frames then make an acute angle with a horizontal orientation of the grate (12).  the grate (13) can be placed horizontally by pivoting it, by means of a handle (24), about a pivotal connection formed by the front cross-member (22) of the frame b.  <image>
