<ABSTRACT>
for powder filling of cables, in a fluidized powder bed,  has been proposed to pass the cable core through a bed in a  substantially closed condition.  there is a limit to the number  of conductors a core can have for effective filling.  in the presÂ­ ent invention the cable core is opened up into a number of  core units by passing through an opening member (50).  the  opening member is freely ridable on the cable core and has a  hole (55, 55a) for each unit.  the opener is held against a  support member (40) and an air bearing formed between the  two members.  air is also usually fed to the holes (55, 55a) in  the opener member through which the core units pass to  prevent flow of powder out from the bed.  the opening  member can be positioned in the fluidized bed or outside  immediately prior to passage of the cable core through the  bed.  the units are each in a substantially closed condition in  the bed and the units close to a single core also in the bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to apparatus for use in fluidized powder filling of multiple core unit cables, and is particularly concerned with opening means for opening a cable into the individual core units for filling. in copending canadian application no. 306,402, filed june 28, 1978, in the name of the present assignee there is described the fluidized powder filling of a cable core by passing the cable core through a fluidized bed in a substantially closed condition. there appears to be a limit to the size of cable core which can effectively be filled, and in the case of a telecommunications cable having a core composed of a multiplicity of pairs of conductors, a convenient maximum unit size is fifty pairs of conductors. for cables having more than this number of conductors, the cable core is "opened" to form a number of core units, each unit being in a substantially closed condition as it passes through the fluidized bed. the cable core can be opened before or after entering the fluidized bed, and closes back again in the bed. in its broadest aspect, the invention is concerned with an opening device for opening a cable core into a plurality of core units, with the individual units being powder filled in a substantially closed condition. the opening device can be positioned in the fluidized bed or outside the bed prior to passage of the cable core through the bed. the device comprises an opening member freely riding on the cable core and supported against a support member through an air bearing arrangement. the invention will be readily understood by the following description of certain embodiments, by way of example, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a diagramnatic longitudinal cross-section through a filling bed with an opening device in the bed; figure 2 is a diagrdmmatic perspective view of the two basic parts of the device, shown spaced apart for clarity; figure 3 is a cross-section on the line iii-iii of figure 2, with the device as in use; figure 4 is a diagrammatic longitudinal crosssection through a filling bed with an opening device outside the bed, before entry of the cable core; figure 5 is a front view of the opening device in figure 4, as it would be seen in the direction of the arrow a in figure 4; ; figure 6 is a cross-section on the line vi-vi of figure 5, illustrating the opening device in more detail; figure 7 is a perspective view on the inner face of the inlet wall of the bed, showing an air collector; figure 8 is a cross-section through an alternative form of cable opening device, on the line viii-viii of figure 9; figure 9 is a face view in the direction of arrow a in figure 8, with certain hidden details shown in dotted outline; figure 10 is d partial cross-section, on the line x-x of figure 8, illustrating the structure at the periphery of the rotating member.
