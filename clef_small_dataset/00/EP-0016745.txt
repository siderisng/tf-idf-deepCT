<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacturing of crumb products  comprising preparation of a first raw material flow f1  containing components or part flows f1 - f4, whereof f2 and  f4 are optional but preferably present, of which   f1 contains liquid milk or milk products such as com­ pletely or partly defatted fresh milk, defatted or whole  condensed milk, whey, completely or partly desalted whey,  butter milk, casein or caseinate, whey protein concentrate or  combinations thereof, at a dry solids content of 20-70% by  weight, especially 30-45% by weight, suitably at a tempera­ ture of about 50°c;   f2 contains sugar raw materials in the form of tetroses,  pentoses, hexoses such as glucose, fructose, galactose,  sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, disaccharides such as  lactose, maltose, dextromaltose, partially hydrolyzed starch,  syrup products, xylitol or different combinations thereof,  suitably in an aqueous solution;   f3 contains dry protein raw materials such as vegetable  protein, dry milk solids, whey powder, butter milk powder,  which suitably are admixed with water and treated in a  colloid mill, at the same dry solids contents as stated for f1;   f4 contains one or more amino acids, preferably in  combination with one or more reducing sugars.  suitably in  an aqueous solution;   and a second flow f2 consisting of part flows f5 and  optionally f6, of which   f5 contains fatty components in the form of cream,  suitably with a fat content of 12-35%,by weight, butter, butter  oil, vegetable and/or animal fat products or fat-containing  products or mixtures thereof;   f6 consists of an emulsifier for the fat phase, which  promotes the formation of emulsions of the type oil-in-water,  e. g.  glyceryl monostearate;   and that the flow f1 at a dry solids content of 20-70% by  weight and a ph in the range 4-8, preferably 6. 5-7. 5, is  heat-treated at a temperature of 100-130°c during a period of  time of about 7-2 minutes for performing a maillard reaction,  and subsequently is cooled to a temperature of suitably  80-95°c;   whereupon the flows f1 at the said temperature and f2  suitably at a temperature of 65-75°c are metered into an  emulsifying vessel to the formation of an emulsion of f2 in  f1, which emulsion after an optional adjustment of the water  content is submitted to a homogenizing treatment in a  homogenizer, whereupon the crumb emulsion formed is  either used directly or dried to the formation of a powder  which optionally can be submitted to a further heat-­ treatment such as in a fluidized bed for a completing maillard  reaction, further drying to a water content of suitable 1. 5-6%  by weight, especially 2-3. 5% by weight, and sieving for  obtaining a desired fraction.
