<ABSTRACT>
a scalpel blade extractor is provided which permits safe  removal of used blades from scalpels or the like in which a  slotted blade is received in opposed lateral grooves in a thin  elongate tang with a proximal region of the blade located  behind the tang in a cut-away laterally convergent region  intermediate the tang and the handle.  the device includes a  base wall (46) over whose surface the scalpel is advanced  and having laterally opposed protuberant regions (43, 44)  over which the blade slides.  a slot (45) between the  protuberant regions which receives the tang of the scalpel  but not the blade.  a fully inserted position of the scalpel is  defined by abutment between the two proximal edges of the  protuberant regions and said convergent region.  a rear wall  (52) is supported behind the slot (45) with its lower edge  spaced from the base wall (46) to allow the scalpel and blade  to be inserted therebetween and to allow a fully inserted  scalpel to be pivoted about the lower edge to a tilted  orientation in which the proximal end of the blade is levered  away from the intermediate region clear of the tang and is  retained by interference with the rear wall (52) during  removal of the scalpel handle in the tilted orientation.  guide  surface (54) proximally of the slot directs the scalpel blade or  handle into the slot.
