<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a support arrangement for  steam turbine having an exhaust port for exhausting mo足 tive fluid therethrough and a condensing apparatus ar足 ranged below the turbine in fluid communication there足 with through the exhaust port.  the condenser has an outer  wall (26) disposed below and flexibly joined to the bottom  (24) of the condenser (12) so as to define with the condenser  bottom a vacuum balancing chamber.  means (30) are pro足 vided rigidly connecting the outer wall (26) to tne turbine  (10), for transmitting the atmospheric pressure forces from  the outer wall to the turbine so as to limit the load on the  turbine's support structure to the turbines weight.  with this  arrangement the turbine support structure needs to be  designed only for the turbine weight.
