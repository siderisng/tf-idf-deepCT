<ABSTRACT>
an improved method of preparing substantially pure  crystalline zeolite zsm-20, a low silica, large pore zeolite from  a reaction mixture containing a source of an alkali metal ox­ ide, an oxide of a tetraethylammonium compound, an oxide  of aluminum, an oxide of silicon wherein tetraalkylorthosili­ cates are the source of silica and water, under controlled  concentration of the hydroxyl, alkali metal, and tetraethylam­ monium ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved method of preparing crystalline zeolite zsm-20 this invention relates generally to an improved method of preparing a crystalline zeolite material and particularly to an improved method of making substantially pure zeolite zsm-20. zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversions. certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicate having a definite crystalline structure within which there are a large number of channels. these cavities and channels are precisely uniform in size. since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as "molecular sieves" and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline aluminosilicates. these aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of sio4 and a104 in which the tetrahedra are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen is 1:2. the electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. this can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as ca/2, sr/2, na, k or li is equal to unity. one type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially by another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. by means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. the spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic aluminosilicates. these aluminosilicates have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite a (u.s. patent 2,882,243), zeolite x (u.s. patent 2,882,244), zeolite y (u.s. patent 3,130,007), zeolite zk-5 (u.s. patent 3,247,195), zeolite zk-4 (u.s. patent 3,314,752) zeolite zsm-5 (u.s. patent 3,702,886), zeolite zsm-11 (u.s. patent 3,709,979), zeolite zsm-12 (u.s. patent 3,832,449) and zeolite zsm-20 (u.s. patent 3,972,983), merely to name a few. a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite well known in the art is faujasite. the zsm-20 zeolite made by the present invention resembles faujasite in certain aspects of structure, but has a notably higher silica/alumina ratio than faujasite. the present invention relates to an improved method of preparing synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate, designated as "zeolite zsm-20" or simply "zsm-20". the zsm-20 composition has a characteristic x-ray diffraction pattern, the values of which are set forth in table 1, of u.s. patent 3,972,983. in the as synthesized form, the zeolite has a formula, in terms of mole ratios of oxides and in the anhydrous state, as follows: (0.3-0.6)r20 : (c.4-0.7)m20 : al203 (7-10) sio2 wherein r
