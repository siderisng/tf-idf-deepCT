<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dynamic spoke relation, which is built on a doped semiconductor substrate (1). A surface-side, opposite to the substrate doped, strip-shaped semiconductor region is formed as a first drive line, while a conductor track separated by an insulating layer from the substrate, which extends transversely to the strip-shaped region, represents a second drive line. The conductor track is separated from a substrate area lying next to the strip-shaped region (2) by a thin film region of the insulating layer. For such memory elements, as a special structure and very small dimensions are sought. According to the invention, this is achieved in that within the strip-shaped area is arranged opposite to this doped, island-shaped semiconductor region (3) which is near that interface of the strip-shaped area which separates this from the semiconductor region located below the thin-film region (42) . The scope of the invention comprises digital semiconductor terspeys with great bit density.
