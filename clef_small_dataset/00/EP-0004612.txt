<ABSTRACT>
a device for changing bodies of utility vehicles has front and rear lifting frames (13), attached to the vehicle frame (4),  with horizontal lifting wheels (8) which engage in guide profiles (7) of the body for the purpose of raising and lowering the body (5).  in order to raise the interchangeable body, hydraulic lifting devices (10) are provided between vehicle frame (4) and guide rods (12) for these lifting wheels.  the locking and unlocking between interchangeable body (5) and vehicle (1) is effected with the aid of retainers mounted on the vehicle, which retainers are tensioned using retaining bolts, mounted on the interchangeable body, by means of tensile turning gear which can be operated from outside from the rear of the vehicle.  for the purpose of storing the body (5), four swivel- out supports (14) are provided in its frame (6).
