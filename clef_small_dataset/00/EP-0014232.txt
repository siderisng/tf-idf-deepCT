<ABSTRACT>
novel polyphosphazene copolymers are prepared which  are comprised of repeating units represented by the  formulas:    wherein x is represented by the formula:    where r₁ and r₂ are independently selected from the group  consisting of substituted and unsubstituted alkyl radicals  containing from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, substituted and  unsubstituted cycloalkyl, aryl, aryl-alkyl and heteroxyclic  radicals or r₁ and r₂ taken together form a cyclic ring; x′ is  selected from the group consisting of chlorine and substituted  and unsubstituted alkoxa, aryloxy, mercapto and amino  radicals, and mixtures thereof; and 20< (w + y + z) < 50,000  per polymer unit.  the polyphosphazene polymers of the present invention  may be prepared by the reaction of a ketoxime and an  additional reactant such as alkanol, aryl alcohol, mercaptan,  or amine with poly (dichlorophosphazene) in the presence of  a tertiary amine.  the polymers of this invention may be  modified by crosslinking or curing.  the polymers of this invention can be utilized to form  protective films and may also be utilized in applications such  as molding, coatings, foams and the like.
