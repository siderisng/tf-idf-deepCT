<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a field effect transistors operating substrate bias generator circuit for converting the voltage and earth potential supplied from a single voltage source to a negative potential whose absolute value is greater than the potential of the voltage source, for applying this potential to the substrate of an integrated circuit, on WECLHEM the Scarf is constructed. The circuit consumes less power per unit of the current released to the circuit and also takes less space as previously known scarf tions. The circuit applies the principle of voltage Sverdupplung to a first capacitor (C1) and thus achieves the desired voltage amplitude over a second capacitor (C2) and then applies the principle of AC coupling to the second condenser SATOR, which via an impedance (4) is connected to the first condenser sator, thus achieving the desired polarization reversal for the substrate protrusion to be generated. This circuit has the power generation necessary for stewage of the substrate to a negative voltage scapacitism and has the required current sink, so that the substrate is held on a sufficient negative bias.
