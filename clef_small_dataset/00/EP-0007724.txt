<ABSTRACT>
a fuel injector valve (10) comprises a magnetic spherical  valve member (28), a non-magnetic valve seat member (30)  on which the spherical valve member (28) is seatable, a main  magnetic pole member (18c) disposed opposite to the valve  seat member (30) to attract the spherical valve member (28), a  side magnetic pole member (34) spaced from and between  the extreme end of the main magnetic pole member (18c) and  the extreme end of the valve seat member (30), and a fuel  injection section (36, 38, 40) through which the fuel which has  passed the clearance between the valve seat member (30) and  the spherical valve member (28) is injected out of the fuel  injector valve (10), so that the fuel injector valve is improved in  response characteristics, stability and durability to render the  injector valve suitable for a so-called single point fuel injection  system.
