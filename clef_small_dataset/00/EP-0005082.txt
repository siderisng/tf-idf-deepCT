<ABSTRACT>
a process for the reduction of the nitrate-nitrogen  content of tobacco by microbial treatment is disclosed.   tobacco materials are subjected, under controlled conditions,  to the action of a microorganism effective in its ability  to degrade nitrates through biochemical reactions in which  nitrogen gas is ultimately formed.  the process is applicable  for all types of tobacco materials such as tobacco filler,  aqueous tobacco extracts, stems, and tobacco processing  streams from various reconstitution processes, as well as  tobacco processing effluent.  tobacco materials treated in  accordance with this process, when incorporated into a  tobacco smoking product, have been found to deliver a  significantly reduced amount of oxides of nitrogen in the  smoke.

<DESCRIPTION>
microbial nitrate removal from tobacco materials by dissimilatory denitrification technical field the present invention pertains to a process for reducing certain nitrogen-containing compounds present in tobacco materials. more specifically, the present invention provides a process for treating tobacco materials by subjecting them to the action of microorganisms whereby nitrate and the subsequent metabolic intermediates are substantially reduced and removed, thereby reducing the total nitrogen content of the tobacco product. smoking articles prepared from the treated tobacco products deliver significantly lowered amounts of oxides of nitrogen on smoking. background of prior art it is generally recognized that smoking products having a lowered amount of oxides of nitrogen present in the smoke are desirable. several techniques have been suggested for reducing oxides of nitrogen in smoking articles. us patents 3,616,801 and 3,847,164 relate generally to reconstituted tobacco and methods wherein ion exchange, ion retardation resins, or electrodialysis techniques are utilized to selectively remove inorganic constituents from aqueous tobacco extracts. the methods disclosed relate generally to the removal of nitrate-containing compounds from tobacco. these particular methods xay be feasible on a small scale but are apt to be both expensive and impractical on a commercial scale. in addition, the methods described appear to be limited to reconstituted tobacco methodology and are not particularly suitable for treating other forms of tobacco such as leaf or filler. moreover, regeneration of the ion exchange resin or disposal of the resin containing the crude nitrate-containing compounds adds to the cost and also presents a problem from an ecological and environmental viewpoint. more recently, a process for recovering crystalline potassium nitrate from tobacco extracts has been described in u.s. patents nos. 4131117 and 4131118. concentrated tobacco extracts are cooled to effect crystallizat;ion of potassium nitrate which is then removed by centrifugation. the partially denitrated tobacco extract containing about 0.3 to 0.5% nitrate is then recombined with a fibrous tobacco web as-in making reconstituted tobacco. the crystalline potassium nitrate by-product may be used for agricultural purposes. an additional method for removing certain agents from tobacco is disclosed in u. s. patent 3,995,646 and involves placing the tobacco in heated liquid for a preselected time period. the wash solution containing tobacco solubles is presumably discarded. the washed tobacco is dried and then rehydrated to restore the tobacco to a condition suitable for use in cigarettes. this process suffers certain disadvantages in that subjecting higher grades of tobacco such as prime leaf or filler to washing in hot or boil- ing water results in an undesirably high loss of tobacco solubles and flavorants. moreover, disposal of the tobacco solubles solution presents a problem from an environmental viewpoint. tso et al. in us patent 3,845,774 describe tobacco treatment methods. referred to as homogenized leaf curing wherein the tobacco is homogenized and incubated under well defined and control led conditions. nitrate-nitrogen and total nitrogen are reduced somewhat; however, the amount of reduction is not as significant as that of the present process. tso et al. alludes to the fact that tobacco modification can
