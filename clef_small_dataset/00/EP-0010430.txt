<ABSTRACT>
an opening roof comprises a frame (1) which surrounds  an opening (5) in a roof (6) of a vehicle and a rigid panel (2)  movable with respect to the frame (1) to expose portions of  the opening (5) for ventilation purposes.  the frame (1)  includes a flange (8) which projects outwardly from a dependÂ­ ing web (7) to overlie a portion of the roof (6) surrounding the  opening.  the frame (1) is secured in position by clamping  strips (15) which act between the outer face of the web (7) and  the lower face of the roof (6) remote from the flange (8), and  screws (19) which project through openings (20) in the web (7)  to urge the strips (15) into engagement with the web (7) and  the flange (8) into engagement with the roof.
