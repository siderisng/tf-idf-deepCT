<ABSTRACT>
Method for removing the positioning errors of electro-erosion machined parts and more particularly, method for obtaining flexible blades and / or electro-error slimming ticks by electro-erro-ecorion of the free central portion, from minus a stem, one of which is integral with a frame (1) and the other ext mity is integral with a movable part (6), characterized in that it consists of thinning with the help of an electrode Cyindric of diameter appropriately suitably a side, then the other, of the central part of the rod (5), so as to produce two bows of opposite circle and aligned by their peak, and to repeat this symmed progressive penetration until In obtaining a deducted line of thickness, the alignment of said vertices being ensured by the fact that the frame (1) has at least one reference plane (3 or 8) serving as support and / or Guide to the pre-mentioned electrode. Fields of Applications: Mechanics, Aeronautics.
