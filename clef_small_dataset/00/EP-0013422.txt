<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for mounting and for aiming an indirectly firing weapon, especially a rocket launcher (1), with a mounting support (18) which rests on a carrier (20) and on which the weapon is articulated, and with a longitudinally adjustable rod (35 and 36 respectively) which is articulated, at one end, on a front part (1a) of the weapon and, at the other end, on a carrier (20), characterized in that, apart from the one rod (35 or 36), a further longitudinally adjustable rod (35, 36) is articulated on the front part (1a) of the weapon, in that the rear ends of the two rods (35, 36) are articulated on the carrier (20) at a distance from one another, in that the two rods (35, 36) each have, in a manner known per se, a threaded spindle (44 and 46 respectively), and a nut part (43 and 45 respectively), in that the two rods (35, 36) are longitudinally adjustable simultaneously in the same direction, via a first drive device (34, 30), for changing the vertical aiming angle of the weapon, and in that the two rods (35, 36) are longitudinally adjustable simultaneously in the opposite direction, via a second drive device (54, 51, 52), for changing the lateral aiming angle of the weapon.
