<ABSTRACT>
pipe section for connecting the ferule (7) of a water  closet (6) and a horizontal conduit (9) opening into a ver­ tical waste pipe (11).  the pipe section makes a substan­ tially 90° bend and the wall (3) has such a shape that the  greater amount of sewage from the water closet (6) is  cast at the bend in horizontal direction directly towards  the waste pipe (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
a pipe section for connecting to the ferule of a water closet. the present invention relates to a pipe section for providing a connection between the closet ferule of a water closet and a subs#cintial1y horizontal conduit in communication with a vertical a toe pipe, said pipe section having a vertical symmetry plane, in which said pipe section forms a substantially 90 short bend. various pipe sections are known which connect the ferule of a water closet with a conduit in communication with a waste pipe, said conduit often forming an acute angle to the waste pipe. in order to place a water closet where desired on an individual deck of a block of flats, the conduit leading to ,ilr waste pipe must extend horizontally in the deck and for this reason the connection between the ferule and such a horizontal conduit must comprise a 90 bend. for this purpose a pipe section has been used with a so-called long bend, i.e. pipe sections .hot have a vertical symmetry plane, the inner nor+io1 of the lend of aid pipe section having a radius of curvature in the symmetry plane of the same dimensions as the diameter of the pipe section itself. however, pipe sections with a shorter bend have also been used. r common problem with such pipe sections is, however, that the pipe section at the bend has a tendency to retard the flow of sewage with waste material, and consequently the waste material has a tendency to form a plug in the passage immediately beyond the bend, often filling up the entire cross section of the pipe. during its continued movement the plug may prevent air from passing and therefore has a tendency to draw all the water out of the water closet. this problem becomes especially great if the conduit leading to the waste pipe extends backward and away from the water closet, since the out-flowing sewage has a strong turbulent flow, which after passing the drain of the water closet will have a relatively small total velocity component in the bend that is directed forward under the water closet. this sewage must be given a direction of movement directly counteracting the forward-directed velocity component. for this reason certain authorities do not allow the horizontal conduit between the pipe section in question and the waste pipe to extend backward and away from the water closet, but only endorse conduits that extend forward within an angle of 750 from their respective sides of the vertical symmetry plane of the water closet. the pipe section according to the invention is characterized in that the pipe section wall forming the outer portion of the bend is shaped so that most of the sewage from the water closet is ¯¯r- < @@ eci in horizontal direction directly towards the @aste pipe. by this means a flow of sewage is achieved which does not sim#1y follow a slight curve, thus reducing @he velocity of -'ne flow, hut is thrown bock at the

claims:   1. a pipe section for providing a connection between the ferule (7) of a water closet (6) and a substantially horizontal conduit (9) in communication with a vertical waste pipe (11), said pipe section having a vertical symmetry plane, in which said pipe section makes a substantially   90     short bend, characterized in that the wall (3) comprising the outer portion of the bend has such a shape that the greatest amount of sewage from the water closet (6) is cast at the bend in horizontal direction directed towards the waste pipe (11).   2.a pipe section as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that  the wall (#) comprising the exterior of the bend consists  of parts of two or more cylindrical surfaces or   cylinder-like     surfaces (4, 5) whose generatrices extend perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the pipe section.      pipe    a pipesection as claimed in claim 2,   characteri#ed    in that the wall   (?,)    comprising the outer portion of the bend consists of   parts    of two cylindrical surfaces (4, 5) of which the first   cylindrical    surface (4), located adjacent the   horizontal    part of the pipe section,   as    a   centre    of   curvature    (a) which coincides approximately   it    the   etre    of curvature of the inner portion (2) of the   bend,    and in   @hat the    radius of curvature of the second cylindrical   surface    (5) is substanticlly larger,   preferably twice    as      cs @@@@as costhe radix. of curvature of the first cylindrical     surface (4).      pipe      i   pipe section as claimed in claim   c,    characterized in that the outer portion (#)   oi    the bend forms a curve of intersecion with the vertical symmetry plane, so tha both the transition between the   hori#ontal    part (2) of the pipe section and the first cylindrical surface (4)   and    the transition   tee    the first and second cylindrical surfaces (4, 5) are tangential.   5. a pipe section substantially as described above and with reference to the accompanying drawings.
