<ABSTRACT>
in an apparatus for and method of collating sheets,  sheets are conveyed to a stacking platform 154 in alternate  offset fashion by grippers 84 and 86 (not shown).  after the  first group of sheets has been stacked, the platform is raised  above a reciprocable arm 250 which is then swung into a  position to support a non-overlapped portion of the bottom  sheet and the platform lowered.  the grippers then convey  the second group of sheets to the platform 154 where they  are inserted below correspondingly offset sheets of the first  group, the arm 250 being reciprocated between sheets to  allow a previously stacked sheet supported thereon to drop.   thus the non-overlapped portions of adjacent sheets are  supported sequentially and the second group of sheets  collated with the first group.  the method is repeated until all  the sheets comprising a set have been inserted into all the  sets.  the stack of offset sets is then ready for removal from  the apparatus by an operator.
