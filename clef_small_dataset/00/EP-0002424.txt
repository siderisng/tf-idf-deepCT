<ABSTRACT>
a locking device for locking a rotatable shaft against  rotation, for instance a shaft through which the supporting  legs of a caravan are activated comprises a housing (4)  having apertures (5) through which the shaft (2) can be  inserted and an element (2a), such as a nut, mounted on said  shaft.  a locking sleeve (6) is arranged for movement parallel  with the shaft between a release position and a locking  position in which the locking sleeve (6) engages said element  (2a), e. g.  said nut.  the shaft is then locked against rotation  and the locking device is prevented from being withdrawn  from the shaft.  the locking sleeve (6) co-operates with a  key-operated cylinder lock which, when the cylinder core or  barrel of said lock and the locking sleeve occupy their  respective locking positions, prevents displacement of the  locking sleeve relative to said housing.  one wall of the housing (4) may have a substantially  t-shaped aperture (5a, 5b) for the shaft (2) and the nut (2a).   the cylinder lock (11) may be mounted on the locking sleeve  (6) and has a latch element (11a) arranged to be received in  recesses or apertures (9; 10) in the locking cylinder (6) and  the housing (4) respectively, said apertunes or recesses being  aligned with one another when the locking sleeve occupies  its locking position.  alternatively the cylinder lock (11) may be mounted to  the housing (4) and has an axially displaceable and a  rotatable core, said core being joined to the locking sleeve (6)  through an element (13).
