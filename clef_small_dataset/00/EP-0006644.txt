<ABSTRACT>
curable, ethylenically unsaturated compositions based on an ester groups-containing compound having excellent fire retardant properties as a result of the incorporation therein of a fire retardant amount of n,n min -ethylene bis(salicylideneiminato)-feii and/or the oxidation product derived therefrom.  preferably, use is made of a filler in an amount of 2 to 60 per cent by weight, calculated on the mixture of filler and components taking part in the curing process in the presence of said iron compound of 0,1 to 5 per cent by weight, calculated on the mixture of fire retardant additive and components taking part in the curing process.  an important group of said ethylenically unsaturated compositions are unsaturated polyester resins which are copolymerized with an unsaturated monomer for use in castings, laminated products and other reinforced articles.
