<ABSTRACT>
a flow regulating device provides continuous, regulat­ ed flow of a medical fluid, as well as intermittent, manually  controlled larger flows of fluid to a catheter system.  such  apparatus includes a control member (10) having an inlet  means (16a, 16c) adapted to be connected by tubing (11,  17) to a source of medical fluid and an outlet means (16b,  16d) adapted to be connected by tubing to a catheter.  a  flexible conduit (22) defines at least a portion of a first  passage (24, 24a) between the inlet means (16a, 16c) and  outlet means (16b, 16d) of the control member (10).  posi­ tioned in the flexible conduit (22) is valve means (23, 23a)  adapted to open when the conduit (22) is squeezed, thereby  providing the larger, intermittent, manually controlled flow  of fluid to the catheter system, and to automatically close  when the conduit (22) is released.  a second passage (25,  25a) in the control member (10) connects the inlet (16a,  16c) and outlet (16b, 16d) means, and in combination  with flow restriction means (25a) therein, provides the  continuous, regulated flow of fluid to the catheter system.
