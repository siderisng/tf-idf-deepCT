<ABSTRACT>
1.  facade facing (weather-boarding) comprising a supporting understructure of vertical supports (40. 1, 40. 2) and of facing boards (10. 1 to 10. 3; 20. 1 to 20. 3; 30. 1 to 30. 3) mounted thereon and arranged in vertical rows in which the respective top facing board (e. g.  10. 2) partly overlaps the respective bottom facing board (e. g.  10. 1), characterized in that neighboring vertical rows are continually staggered with respect to one another by an amount given by half the difference between the height (h) of the facing boards (10. 1 to 10. 3; 20. 1 to 20. 3; 30. 1 to 30. 3) and the overlap within said rows, that the facing boards of neighboring rows partly overlap one another horizontally, with each of said facing boards (e. g.  10. 2 or 20. 2) being inserted respectively between the two adjoining facing boards (e. g.  20. 2 and 20. 3 or 10. 2 and 10. 3) of the neighboring row, that said vertical supports (40. 1, 40. 2) are arranged at a spaced relation resulting from the difference between the width (b) of said facing boards and the lateral overlap (h) of neighboring rows, and that said facing boards are fixed to said vertical supports (40. 1, 40. 2) in all of those areas in which one vertical edge of a facing board meets upon a bottom edge of another facing board.
