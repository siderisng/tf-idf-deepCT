<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a NUVEAU produced by a metal silicate metal ratio Sili CE / metal oxide at least equal to 2, advantageously between 3 and 5. This product is characterized by the fact that it has a loss to firesubstantially zero between 500 and 900 ° C and is amorphous and isotropic.This silicate may in particular be a lead silicate that serves as a basic product for a new vitridge composition.The present invention also covers a method for obtaining sidlicate according to the invention.This method is characterized by the fact that a solution of soluble alkaline silicate and a solution of a metal soluble salt is made to be taken to prepare the silicate to substitute at least a portion of the al oxide.Calin in the starting silicate by the oxide of the metal.The present invention finds in particular its apparatus in glassware.
