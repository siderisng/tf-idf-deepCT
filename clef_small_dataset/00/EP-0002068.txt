<ABSTRACT>
an electrode for implantation into cochlea.  the purpose  is to establish electrical communication to the  acoustic nerves of the human ear, substantially in the area  of cochlea containing the acoustic nerves pertaining to  that part of the audible spectrum which is relevant to the  intelligibility of speech.  the problem is, that an electrode  inserted into cochlea certainly has made it possible to  bring the patient in such a condition that she or he could  interpret electrical signals supplied through the electrode  as being sound but not as being intelligible speech.  the invention provides an electrode, which has two  conditions of curvature, the one of which is temporary (10)  and corresponds to the curvature in the middle of the  particular turn of cochlea and the other one of which is  permanent (11) and corresponds to the first position of the  electrode in cochlea in which position it obtains an optimum  contact to the acoustic nerves.  the electrode of the  invention further has means for changing the condition  of curvature from the temporary one to the permanent one,  when the electrode has been inserted into cochlea.  the  permanent condition of curvature whereas the temporary  condition of curvature is established by means of a  detechable or loosenable connection; which, until it is  detached or loosened, maintains the temporary condition  of curvature.  a quick and reliable operation is made possible  and the probability of obtaining a uniform communication  over various frequency ranges along the cochlea is  becoming great.
