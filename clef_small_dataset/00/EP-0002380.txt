<ABSTRACT>
stained textile fabrics, especially cotton-polyester,  rayon-polyester blends stained in use with blood stains, can  be reclaimed and returned to use by the process of washing  and bleaching said fabrics in the presence of a non-ionic and  anionic surface-active agent, together with an oxygen-releasing  bleaching agent and a chlorine-releasing bleaching  agent, said bleaching agents used either successively or  simultaneously.  the laundering process involves the use of  aqueous solutions of bleaching agents at elevated temperatures  and at a high ph.  the process of the invention provides  a synergistic improvement in the removal of stains as  compared with the use of either an oxygen-releasing  bleaching agent or a chlorine-releasing bleaching agent.  the  process can include a hot aqueous acid sour treatment to  remove rust stains and an aqueous sour to neutralize alkalies  in the bleached fabric.  the treatment can be completed in a  period of time of about 30 to about 90 minutes.
