<ABSTRACT>
a dental implant system to provide a mechanically  self-sufficient artificial tooth possessing a functional pseudo  peridontal ligament that does not cause resorption of the  supporting bone and ultimate loss is disclosed.  the implant  includes a core component (1) that withstands the masti足 catory load and transmits such load to the root system.  the  root system comprises an outer component (3) that ad足 heres to the lawbone (2) and possesses a similar modulus  of elasticity thus capable of transmitting masticatory stres足 ses along its interface with the bone without excessive  stress concentrations and an intermediate component (4)  adhering tightly to both the core component (1) and the  outer component (3) and having a much lower modulus of  elasticity than either the core component (1) and the outer  component (3).  the longitudinal movement of the core  component (1) causes the oblique or diagonal stretching  of the intermediate component (4) which pulls or applies  a force an the outer component (3) which tends to con足 tract it and creates tensile stresses in the portions of the  supporting jawbone (2) which interface with the outer  component.  such tensile stresses cause bone deposition  and stabilize the implant further.
