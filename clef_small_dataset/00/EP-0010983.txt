<ABSTRACT>
positioning apparatus enabling an article such as, for  example, a wafer (15) to be subjected to a photo-lithographic  exposure, to be positioned accurately, for example in relation  to an exposure mask (12).  the article rests in frictional  engagement on a support (22) coupled to piezoelectric  transducers (17).  the article may be moved through very  small distances by applying suitable dc voltages to the pie­ zoelectric transducers.  for greater movements an asymme­ tric waveform may be applied to the transducers, causing  the article to move with a jogging motion through much  greater distances.  the asymmetric waveform may be ob­ tained, for example, by charging and discharging the capa­ city of the transducers through resistors of suitable value,  or by applying a full wave rectified ac voltage to them.  four  transducers may be used to enable the article to be moved in  either of two mutually perpendicular directions or rotated  about an axis.  the supports (22) may be tubular  and means (26, 27) may be provided for applying vacuum  through them to increase the pressure of frictional engage­ ment.
