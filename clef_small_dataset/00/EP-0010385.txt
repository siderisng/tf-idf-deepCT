<ABSTRACT>
a light-weight, thermally resistant, shock-resistant  refractory member (13) for covering a water pipe in a high-­ temperature environment.  the refractory member is a partial  cylinder including a body segment (6), two protuberances  (10,15) spaced apart from and on either side of the body  segment by corresponding recesses (16) and terminating in a  void (28) between the two protuberances.  two identical  members, when axially aligned in juxtaposition, are fitted  together around a pipe (20) such that the body segment (6) of  each refractory member is intimately received by the corres­ ponding void (28) of the other member and the pair of pro­ tuberances (10,15) of one member are closely received and  interlocked with the corresponding pair of recesses (16) in the  other member to form a substantially closed refractory unit  around the pipe.  the unit requires no additional means to  support itself around the pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
cermlic fibre refractory member for insulating a pipe. this invention relates to a ceramic fibre refractory member for insulating a pipe within a high temperature environment. in furnaces used throughout the metallurgical and related industries to heat a slab, billet, bloom or other raw steel shape, a typical furnace includes a complex network of vertical and horizontal water-cooled pipes which support an additional network of horizontal wateracooled skid rails along which the slabs, billets,blooms, or other raw steel shapes are pushed or walked through the furnace. the metallurgical furnace is an open system; that is, heat which is transferred to the metal oipe network is conducted by the water flowing in the pipes to a point outside the furnace and is not recoverable. accordingly, vast heat losses occur and correspondingly unnecessary amounts of energy are expended to replace the heat loss as a result of the heat transfer into the water-cooled pipe network.. for example, as much as thirty to thirty-five percent of the total heat supplied to a metallurgical furnace by the combustion of fuels is lost in an infrastructure of uninsulated skid pipes and the supporting pipe network. for all5 mm od uninsulated water-cooled pipe in a furnace operating at 1300 - 14000c, the heat loss is approximately 398,000 - 415,000 lj per lineal meter per hour. for a furnace having go meters each of skid pipe, horizontal support pipe and vertical support pipe, the heat loss is thus approxitately 180 x 406,500 kj/hour or 73,170,000 kj per hour. to date, various types of refractory materials have been applied to the water-cooled pipe infrastructure in order to reduce the amount of heat loss from the furnace. the use of pre-fired or chemically bonded refractory materials which are welded, studded, wired, clipped or anchored with interlocking anchor straps is well known. the use of welds, studs, wires and the like requires large expenditures of labour and time to strip the pipe and secure an additional refractory as a replacement. moreover, refractory concretes have even been formed in place around the pipe surfaces and supported by any number and type of metallic anchors welded to the pipe surface. almost without exception these forms of insulation have failed within a relatively short period of operation because of the inherent friability and susceptibility to fracture of the heavy, brittle fired ceramic refractory materials. as the metallic shape is moved along the metal skid rail, significant vibration and flexion of the water-cooled pipe infrast##ucture occur which are in turn transmitted into the friable, dense, rigid ceramic insulators. high temperature ceramic fibre blankets in the form of split rings, modules or simple wrappings have also been utilized as a means of insulating the pipe infrastructure. the use of ordinary high temperature ceramic fibres and ceramic fibre blankets as insulators around the water-cooled pipe has proven unsatisfactory for a number of reasons: first, the ordinary high temperature ceramic fibre blanket is susceptible to chemical reaction with scale and slag which is produced during the furnace
