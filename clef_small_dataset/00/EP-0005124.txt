<ABSTRACT>
improved process for preparing composite materials for treating molten metals and bodies thereby produced, capable to realise at slow rate in the metal baths elements for controlling the inclusions state as well as for deoxidation and desulphurization purposes.   <??>the process according to the invention consists in subjecting a mixture, containing active agents (percent by weight 50-90%, grain size 3-10 mm), inert material (5-50%; 3-20 mm) and binding agent (2-10%), to the operations of homogenizing, briquetting (i. e.  shaping and compacting), setting the binding agent and baking.   <??>the active agent can be selected in the group of alkaline elements, alkaline-earth elements and compounds thereof, eventually in combination with aluminium and silicon.   <??>the composite bodies are stable in time and can be stored and used even in green form, i. e.  without previous baking.
