<ABSTRACT>
The device is used for vibration-free, vertical production of radially pressed concrete tubes provided with bottom sleeve concrete pipes, which is respectively shaped in a mold (1) by means of a rotating drum (5) arranged on a shaft (9). Above the drum (5) radially acting the concrete (6) introduced into the mold (1) are arranged against the inner wall of the mold (1) pushing rollers (7). A pressure wheel (8) is formed such that the supplied concrete (6) between its spokes (12) and the rollers (7) falls onto the upper plate (13) of the drum (5) and between the mold (1) and the Pressure wheel (8) forms a concrete bridge which prevents a dodge of the concrete (6) pressed by the rollers (7) against the mold (1). The outer surface of the pressure wheel (8) has a circular cylinder and / or a frusto-conical part, wherein the latter part tapers downwards. This outer surface causes the concrete pressure to the sleeve reinforced. The concrete tube (11) is produced in a uniform radial pressing operation. Since no weak points occur due to different press or concrete types, the concrete tube has an improved quality compared with a vibrated muffentel.
