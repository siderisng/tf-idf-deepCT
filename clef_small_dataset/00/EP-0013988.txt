<ABSTRACT>
1.  a releasable connection between two shell-or plate-shaped building components (4, 5), for example for walls, floors, ceilings or the like, which comprises eyes (or : ears, loops) (1, 2, 3), which are connectable by pins (6), at at least two different levels of the building components (4, 5), whose eyes (1, 2, 3) co-operating at the same level have a common axis that is approximately vertical to the surface of the component (4, 5), each eye (1, 2, 3) of one building component (4 or 5) engaging in a correspondingly provided recess (or : depression) in the other building component (5 or 4), characterized in that, measured in the direction vertically to the joint plane, the apertures formed by the eyes (1, 2, 3), the pin (6) and the joint (7) itself have, apart form minimal tolerances, the same dimension, and in that each eye (1, 2, 3) engages as far as its aperture, in the recess in the other building component.
