<ABSTRACT>
documents in a stack (16) are loaded into a bin (12, 14)  from which an endmost document (16a) is fed by some  means to a generally cylindrical drum (26) having a high  friction surface (26a) which is rotationally driven about its  cylindrical axis.  a plurality of resilient continuous stretchable  friction belts (30) of lower friction than the high friction drum  surface are arranged parallel to one another around pulley  supports (32, 34) positioned such that non-friction circumferential  areas around cylindrical drum surface stretch the  path of continuous belts between adjacent pulleys.  the  continuous belts are driven in the opposite direction from the  high friction cylindrical surface of the drum.  the opposed  moving surfaces separate adjacent sheets while the belts  apply a normal pressure to a document on the high friction  surface so that it draws the endmost document from the  stack and carries the separated single document through the  mechanism by itself.
