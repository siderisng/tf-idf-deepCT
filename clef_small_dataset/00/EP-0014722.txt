<ABSTRACT>
an evaporator, used as an alternative means of disposing  of biological wastes or wastes containing biological matter  from, for example, oil flush toilets or minimum flush toilets or  in any biological waste treatment system.  the evaporator  includes a storage tank (2) containing the waste with aeration  means (7,8) employed to expose large surface areas of the  waste to free air and a heat source (5) to supply sufficient heat  energy to equal the heat of vaporization required for evapora­ tion of the water into the air, and maintain a temperature at  which evaporation and biological activity take place.  satu­ rated air at an elevated temperature leaves the tank through a  vent (3).  as waste is introduced, heat and air are added to  promote evaporation and, thermophilic aerobic biological  activity.  the air supply is provided at a rate commensurate  with the supply of waste material, and the temperature is  adjusted (for example to 58°c but below 100°c) to accommo­ date a particular strain of thermophilic bacteria, ambient air  conditions, percent of organic substances or other criteria that  may be established as a function of design criteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
process and apparatus for treating organic taste the present invention relates to waste disposal systems for digesting and evaporating human or other organic wastes. these wastes may for example come from oil flush toilets, foam flush toilets, low flush toilets or conventional toilets or from combined domestic wastes. the present invention is more particularly directed toward a thermophilic evaporatordigestor system in which the wastes are subjected to aeration at low temperatures, with the result that they are digested and evaporated. the evaporator with thermophilic digestor of the present invention was developed as an alternative method for the disposal of human wastes. these wastes may come from any number of sources such as combined municipal sewerage, mixed domestic wastes, or the segregated wastes from conventional toilets. however, since this device requires sufficient heat to evaporate the water therein contained, it is most efficiently applied to the elimination of wastes containing the minimum admixture of water for flushing. one example of such a toilet is the oil flush toilet, as taught by claunch, in u.s. patent 3,673,614 and 3,974,528, entitled "sewage system with reusable flush medium". another toilet system with which the present device has been tested is the "foam-flush toilet" as taught by masami miya in u.s. patent no. 3,585,649. various other low-flush toilets can be used with this device, for example the low-flush toilet as taught by burton in japanese patent application no. 27927/75. in this latter case, the thermophilic evaporator-digestor would take the place of the redwood filter device as taught by burton in japanese patent application no. 831225. this invention uses the phenomena of evaporating water at elevated temperature and supporting aerobic high-temperature bacterial activity both dependent upon aeration of the wastes at slid elevated temperatures. in a literature search for an-elevated temperature which would inactivate the more common pathogenic bacteria, it was determined that certain strains of non-pathogenic, high-temperature compatible micro-organisms have been isolated. it was further discovered that the thermophilic micro-organisms exhibit beneficial characteristics enabling them to metabolize organic substances at elevated temperatures, for example above 50 c. it was, therefore theorized in the present invention that a combination of elevated temperature and airflow could be employed in such a manner that the thermophilic bacteria would be maintained in the aerobic state, organic waste substances would be metabolized, pathogenic microorganisms would be deactivated, and the water in the wastes would be evaporated. undiluted human waste contains approximately 95% water. the remaining 5% consists primarily of a mixture of organic compounds and inorganic salts. it was theroized that, by aerating these waste mixtures at elevated temperatures, it would be possible to metabolize the organic compounds to carbondioxide, water, nitrates, nitrites, volatile oxides of nitrogen, and sulphites and sulphates. under the condition of aeration, all of the volatile products of metabolism, including the water, could be swept out of the mixture. claunch teaches the use of an incinerator to dispose of the wastes from an oil flush toilet. however, the energy required to incinerate mixed human wastes is
