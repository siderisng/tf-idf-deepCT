<ABSTRACT>
water-insoluble yellow monoazo dyes, having the for­ mula:    wherein r₁ and r² are indifferently hydrogen atoms, alkyls  having up to 4 carbon atoms, phenyls, also substituted; x is  an atom selected from among hydrogen, chlorine and  bromine, or it is an alkyl group, an alkoxyl group, a carboxyes­ ter group having up to 4 carbon atoms, a carboxyl group, a  group cf₃, cn, no₂, so₂ch₃, a sulphonamido group, and n is  an integer selected from among 1, 2 and 3, methods of prep­ aration and use of the foregoing are also disclosed.  the above dyes are particularly suited for the dyeing and  printing of hydrophobic synthetic fibers, in particular polyes­ ter fibers, with yellow shades.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a new class of water-insoluble yellow monoazo dyes. these dyes are confirming to formula k): emi1.1 wherein r1 and r2 are indifferently hydrogen atoms, alkyls having up to 4 carbon atoms, phenyls, also substituted; x is an atom selected from amongst hydrogen, chlorine and bromine, or it is an alkyl group, an alkoxyl group, a carboxyl ester group having up to 4 carbon atoms, a carboxyl group, a group cf3, cn, n02, so2ch3, a sulphonamide group, and n is an integer selected from among 1, 2 and 3. the present invention relates furthermore to the preparation of the dyes of formula (i) and the use of same. the dyes object of this invention are particularly suitable for dyeing and printing hydrophobic synthetic fibres, in particular polyester fibres, with yellow shades. these dyes, when applicated according to the usual dyeing and printing methods, provide on these materials dyeings and printings endowed with a high tinctorial strength and excellent general characteristics. in particular the dyes of the present invention exhibit a high stability to light, to-wet treatments and to heat treatments. these dyes result also suitable for applications of the "thermosol" type (190-2200c). the dyes of the present invention have furthermore exhibited an-62tellent behaviour in the dyeing and printing of polyester-cotton blended fibres, according to known processes used at present, as they have all the main characteristics required for this application, i.e.: - a good affinity for polyester fibres, - affinity for cotton in the presence of swelling agents, - possibility of obtaining dyeings with very slight diffe rences of shades on the two fibres. as far as the applicant knows, the class of dyes comprised in formula (i) and object of the present invention is neither known nor has been described so far. it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new class of azo dyes having particularly interesting applications in uhe fields specified hereinbefore. this and still further objects, which will more clearly appear to those skilled in the art, can be achieved, according to this invention, by the class of compounds having formula (i) and by the process for preparing same, characterized in that a 1-phenyl-3-amino-pyrazol of formula (ii): emi2.1 wherein fl1, r2, x and n have the meanings specified herein before, is diazotized at a temperature ranging from 0 to 50c approximately, and is then coupled with a compound of formula (iii): emi3.1 at a temperature ranging approximately from 50 to 200c. the coupling compound employed (iii) permits to operate at ph values comprised between about 3 and 10. more in particular, and according to an embodiment of the present invention, the dyes forming the object of this invention are obtained by diazotizing, according to substantially conventional methods, the l-phenyl-3-amino pyrazols of formula (ii) as defined hereinbefore, and by successively coupling, in an acid to basic medium, the diazopyrazols obtained on 2-hydroxy-dibenzofuran of formula (iii). according to another effective ambodiment, the dyes of the present invention can be also prepared
