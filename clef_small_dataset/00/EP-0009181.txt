<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing an electrical contact between a normally conductive contact body and the end piece of an in-situ-annealed superconductor from an intermetallic compound. If a corresponding conductor pre-product is applied to the contact body from the in-situ annealing, a reactive element of the superconducting compound to be produced in the subsequent annealing can diffuse into the material of the contact body and so for a reaction to the superconducting connection is missing. The result is a reduced power carrying capability of the superconductor. According to the invention is therefore provided that the corresponding end piece (19) of the conductor precursor (2) prior to the annealing on a molded body (7) from a heat-resistant, in the annealing with the elements of the conductor precursor (2) is unused material and that after the annealing of the molded bodies (7) against a con tact body (23) is exchanged with a corresponding shape. With the method according to the invention, in particular contacts for high-field magnets with supra conductors of brittle intermetallic compounds such. b. Create NB SN or V GA.
