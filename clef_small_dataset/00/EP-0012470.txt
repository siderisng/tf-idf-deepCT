<ABSTRACT>
a process for the conversion of the trans isomer of an  ester of an acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit    into the cis isomer of such an ester or the corresponding  free acid or a salt thereof, which comprises converting the  trans isomer into an ester of an acid whose carbon skeleton  includes the unit    and subsequently hydrogenating said compound; and if  desired, converting a resulting ester into the corresponding  free acid or a salt thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
"isomerisation of pyrrolidine derivatives" this invention relates to a process for the isomerisation of derivatives of 3-azabicyclo[3.1.00 hexane. 2-carboxy-3-azabicyclo [3.1.0ghexane and certain derivatives thereof have exhibited extremely useful plant growth regulating and pollen suppressing properties. the single isomer cis (l) 2-carboxy-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0] hexane is found in the seeds of the american horse chestnut in small amounts, and much research has been directed to developing a synthetic method of producing this and the other isomers in larger amounts. a method has now been found by which trans 2-carboxy-3 azabicyclo[3.l.o]hexane and derivatives thereof can be converted into the corresponding cis isomer. the invention provides a process for the conversion of the trans isomer of an ester of an acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit emi1.1 into the cis isomer of such an ester or the corresponding free acid or a salt thereof, which comprises converting the trans isomer into an ester of an acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit emi2.1 and subsequently hydrogenating said compound; and, in the event of an ester resulting and an acid or salt being required, converting the resulting ester into the corresponding free acid or a salt thereof. various possibilities for isomerism exist, of course, depending upon the nature of substituents on the bicyclic nucleus. however, throughout this specification, a trans isomer should be understood to be a geometric isomer in which the -co2- group in the 2-position of the 3-azabicyclohexane ring is trans to the bridging group in the 6-position, and a cis isomer is a geometric isomer in which the -co2- group is cis to the bridging group. it should be noted that for each such geometric isomer, a pair of optical isomers exists, due to the asymmetry of the 2-carbon atom. the starting trans ester may be either pure trans ester or it may be present in a mixture of cis and trans esters. thus any mixture of cis and trans esters may be converted into cis compound, or into a mixture-of trans and cis compounds containing an enhanced proportion of cis isomer, by the process of the invention. if desired, the product obtained directly from the hydrogenation process, if it is an esters, may be converted into the corresponding free acid or a salt thereof. this may be performed by any suitable method, for example hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions, and if desired subsequent conversion of a resulting free acid into a salt thereof, or conversion of a resulting salt into the corresponding free-acid. hydrogenation of certain esters may produce the free cis acid directly, if the starting ester moiety is one which is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. thus, if the desired product of the process of the invention is a free acid, a preferred embodiment of the process comprises starting from such an ester, preferably a benzyl ester. hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ester of an acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit ii, leads not only to hydrogenolysis of the c = n double bond giving a cis isomer, but also

claims   1. a process for the conversion of the trans isomer of an ester  of an acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit emi9.1       into the cis isomer of such an ester or the corresponding free acid or a salt thereof, which comprises   converting    the trans isomer into an ester of an acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit emi9.2        and subsequently hydrogenating said compound; and in the  event of an ester resulting and an acid or salt being required,  converting the resulting ester into the corresponding free  acid or a salt thereof.   2. a process as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the  starting ester is converted into the ester ii by reaction  with an oxidising agent.   3. a process, as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the  oxidising agent is manganese dioxide.     4. a process as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the  starting ester is converted into the ester   il    by chlorinating  or brominating the starting ester to give   ancesteraof an    acid  whose carbon skeleton includes the unit emi10.1        in which hal is a chlorine or bromine atom, and subsequently  dehydrohalogenating the n-halo compound.   5. a process as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the  starting ester is chlorinated using n-chlorosuccinimide,  t-butyl hypchlorite or sodium hypochlorite.   6. a process as claimed in either claim 4 or claim 5, characterised  in that the halogenation is carried out at a temperature in  the range of from -100c to   +300c.      7. a process as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6, characterised  in that the   dehydrohalogenation    step is carried out using an  alkali metal hydroxide or alkoxide.   8. a process as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 7, characterised  in that the dehydrohalogenation step is carried out at a  temperature of up to   1500c.      9. a process as claimed in any one of   claims    to 8, characterised  in that the hydrogenation step is carried out using gaseous  hydrogen in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst.   10. a process as claimed in claim 9, characterised in that the  catalyst comprises palladium or platinum.   11. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised  in that the alcohol from which the starting ester is derived  is a liquid, and the hydrogenation step is carried out using  this alcohol as solvent.    12. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised  in that a resulting cis ester is converted into the corresponding  free acid or a salt thereof.   13. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised  in that the starting ester is an alkyl ester.        14.    a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised  in that the starting ester is one in which the ester moiety  is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, thus producing the cis isomer  of a free acid whose carbon skeleton includes the unit ii.   15. a process as claimed in claim 14, characterised in that the  starting ester is a benzyl ester.   16. a process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 15, characterised  in that the units i and ii are substituted only by hydrogen  atoms.
