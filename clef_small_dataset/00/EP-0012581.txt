<ABSTRACT>
a decorative emblem is formed by producing a decora­ tive surface (14), which may be printed and embossed, on a  foil substrate (16).  an integral bezel (12) is then formed  around the periphery of the decorative surface.  fluent plastic  material (29) is cast onto the decorative surface to form a  meniscus over it.  upon curing, the plastic cap so formed  gives a lens effect to the decorative surface.  the decorative  emblem may be provided with any of several types of differ­ ent attachment means, such as an edge adhesive strip, for  fastening it to the intended surface such as an automobile,  appliance, or other object.

<DESCRIPTION>
decorativ: emblems and method for making same the present invention relates to decorative emblems, plaques and panels, hereinafter generally referred to as "emblems, which have a cured plastic layer deposited onto a decorative surface having an integral bezel, and to a method for making the same. decorative emblems are widely used throughout a number of industries, including the automotive and appliance fields. in the past, a colored vitreous frit was 0 flowed into a bronze substrate and fired at 1250if. the glass-like vitreous enamel served to beautify the product and protect the decorative substrate from weathering when the emblem was exposed to the environment. today, plastics are primarily used for producing such emblems. for example, the applicants have since 1966 produced an emblem having a molded or cast body into which plastic is deposited. a description of such products can be found in an article in the july-august, 1972, issue of the dupont magazine. likewise, in u.s. patent no.3,654,062, there is disclosed a process for injection molding a decorative mylar facing sheet over a vinyl plastic body. the resulting plaque is coated with a layer of protective varnish on the outer surface of the facing sheet. u.s. patent no .3,246, 066, is similar in that male and female molds are used to form a cavity into which a decorative foil is placed and into which a clear plastic material is injected. prior to injecting a clear plastic material against the front face of the foil, the foil is precoated. other molding processes, such as compression molding (either one or two shot), are also well known in the art. see for instance, u.s. patents no. 2,244,565; 2,931,119; 3,075,249; and 3,114,597. in u.s. patent 4,100,010, assigned to the applicants, there is disclosed an improved process for producing decorative emblems. that process involves casting a plastic material onto decorative foil shapes to form a meniscus which when cured gives a lens effect to the top surface of the foil shape. a problem with that process is that the then capped substrate does not usually make up a complete decorative emblem. normally, the capped substrate will be used as an insert to be placed inside a decorative bezel, which is most commonly a highly polished die casting, or plastic or plated plastic or some other decorative substance. in such a process, it is thus necessary to decorate the substrate, emboss the decorated substrate, if desired, apply a pressure-sensitive adhesive to the back of the substrate, cast the plastic material onto the top surface of the substrate, and then insert that capped decorated substrate into a separately manufactured decorated bezel. as can be seen, this involves a large number of process steps, many requiring the work of skilled craftsmen. accordingly, the need exists for a more efficient method of forming an improved emblem which does not require separate bezel and insert formation. the present invention meets that need by utilizing a decorative surface having an integral bezel formed peripherally around it. that is, a decorated

 claims   1. a decorative emblem comprising a foil having a decorative surface characterised in that the foil (16) has an integral bezel (12) formed peripherally around said decorative surface (14), said decorative surface having cast and cured thereon a plastic material (29) contiguous with said peripheral bezel (12) and having a meniscus shape whereby a lens effect is given to said decorative surface.   2. a decorative emblem as claimed in claim 1, wherein said foil (16) is a metal foil, e.g. an aluminium foil.   3. a decorative emblem as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said decorative surface of said foil is embossed.   4. a decorative emblem as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said foil is attached to a backing plate (17) having grooves (18) formed therein opposite said peripheral bezel (12), and an edge adhesive strip (20) located in said grooves.   5. a decorative emblem as claimed in claim 4, wherein said edge adhesive strip (20) is either a pressure-sensitive adhesive bead or a two-sided pressuresensitive adhesive tape.   6. a decorative emblem as claimed in claim 1, 2 or   3,    wherein said foil is attached to a backing plate (24) having connecting pins (28) extending therefrom.   7. a method for producing decorative emblems characterised by:  a) producing a decorative surface (14) on a foil substrate (16),    b) forming in said foil substrate an integral bezel (12) peripherally around said decorative surface,  c) casting a fluent plastic material (29) onto said decorative surface (14) so that it completely covers said decorative surface and is contiguous with said peripheral bezel (12), and  d) curing said fluent plastic so that it gives a lens effect to said decorative surface.    8. a method as claimed in claim 7, further including embossing said decorative surface prior to casting said fluent plastic thereon.   9. a method as claimed in claim 7 or 8, further including the step of attaching the side of foil substrate opposite said decorative surface to a backing place.   10. a method as claimed in claim 9, further including forming peripheral grooves into said backing plate so as to be located opposite said peripheral bezel, and placing into said grooves an edge adhesive strip.
