<ABSTRACT>
ion exchange can be carried out between ion exchange  resins having a particle size of 0. 01 to 1. 5 micrometers and  macrobead ion exchange resins having a particle size of  at least 40 micrometers in batch and continuous processes.   this can be used to place the fine resins in a desired ionic  form either during their preparation or to regenerate them  after use.  individual or mixed fine resins and individual or  mixed macrobead resins can be used in this way.
