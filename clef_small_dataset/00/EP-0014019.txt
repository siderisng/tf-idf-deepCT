<ABSTRACT>
a dynamic beam current control circuit for a television  camera tube (10) features a threshold circuit (24) so that  the correction is effected only for a large light intensities  impinging on the television camera tube (10) and a non­ linear circuit (26) which has a characteristic which is in  the inverse of the control electrode voltage versus beam  current characteristic of the camera tube (10).  this com­ bination provides a stable feedback loop.
