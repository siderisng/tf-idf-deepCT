<ABSTRACT>
a fixed functional relationship in either tabular or  equation form is established between the growth of various  microorganisms in the presence of a few (e. g. , one or two)  predetermined concentrations (108) of a predetermined  antibiotic and the minimum concentration of such anti­ biotic necessary to at least inhibit the activity of such sam­ ples.  the relationships are established for each desired  combination of antibiotic and general class of microorgan­ isms and the degree of growth (112) is measured at a pre­ determined time or level of growth, preferably before satu­ ration occurs at "growth" or "no growth" extremes.  the  minimum concentrations used in deriving these fixed rela­ tionships are determined by standard accepted quantitative  techniques.  thereafter, the minimum concentration of the  predetermined antibiotic necessary to at least inhibit the  activity of any given pathogenic microorganism (116) taken  from the same predetermined general class of organisms  may be rapidly and accurately determined by (1) measur­ ing the- growth of such sampled pathogenic organism (120)  after the same predetermined time in the presence of the  same few (e. g. , one or two) predetermined concentrations  of the antibiotic and (2) using the resulting measurements  together with the previously established fixed functional  relationship to identify the required minimum concentration  for that particular combination of microorganism, and anti­ biotic.  apparatus for semiautomatically and for automati­ cally carrying out this method are also disclosed.
