<ABSTRACT>
a scroll-type refrigerant compressor unit is obtained  in which any deflection and undesired vibration of moving  parts are prevented by a simple construction and in which  the orbiting scroll member is prevented from rotating by a  simple mechanism.  a disk rotor (21) having a drive pin (23) is mounted  on an inner end of a drive shaft (16) which is rotatably  mounted through a front end plate of a compressor hous­ ing.  the disk rotor is rotatably supported on the inner sur­ face of the front end plate through a thrust bearing (22).   the orbiting scroll member (24) is rotatably mounted on  the drive pin.  the orbiting scroll member (24) has a radial flange  (241) integrally formed with the scroll member, which flan­ ge is supported on the disk rotor through a thrust bearing  (26).  therefore, the drive shaft, disk rotor, drive pin and  orbiting scroll member are supported without undersired  deflection and vibration during operation.  a ring like slider  plate member (29) is disposed between the radial flange  and the end plate of the orbiting scroll member.  the slider member is so connected to the end plate  of the orbiting scroll member by key and keyway connec­ tion that the relative rotation of them is prevented while the  relative movement of them in a radial direction is permit­ ted.  the slider plate member is also so connected to a  member fixed to the inner surface of the compressor hous­ ing by key and keyway connection that relative rotation is  prevented while the relative movement is permitted in a ra­ dial direction perpendicular to the relative movement be­ tween the slider member and the orbiting scroll member.   those keys and keyways may be preferably so formed that  the contact surface between mating key and keyway for re­ ceiving rotational torque is on a diameter of the slider  member.
