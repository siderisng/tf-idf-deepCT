<ABSTRACT>
a comparator for comparing the relative magnitudes of  first and second voltages (vs, vc) and for providing a binary  output indicative of which of the voltages is the greater.  the  voltages are applied sequentially to a capacitor (c) during  first and second periods respectively.  an inverter (13) has its  input connected to the capacitor, and a voltage bias source  (14) applies a bias voltage to the input of the inverter in such  manner as to cause the output of the inverter (13) to assume  a predetermined voltage during the first period and a voltage  either greater or less than the predetermined voltage during  the second period, depending upon whether the first voltage  is greater or less than the second voltage.  a flip-flop (16) is  connected to the output of the inverter such as to be either  set or reset in response to the output of the inverter being  greater or less than the predetermined voltage during the  second period.
