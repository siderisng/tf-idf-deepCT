<ABSTRACT>
a foam extrusion apparatus and method employs tan­ dem extruders (12) mounted on horizontal rails (25,26) for  movement toward and away from the end of a vacuum  chamber (10) which is in the form of an elongated inclined  barometric leg.  the upper end of the chamber (10) is closed by  a substantial bulkhead (40) also supported on rails and held in  inclined position to close the end of the chamber (10) when  moved thereagainst.  a die (42) is positioned on the inside of  the bulkhead (40) and aligned with the leg (10) when closed.   the extruders (12) are connected to the die (42) through a  length of pipe (37) supported through the bulkhead (40) by a  stainless steel bellows (120).  the pipe (37) externally of the  bulkhead (40) is provided with a circulating jacket for tempera­ ture control.  the die is adjustable externally (136) of the bulk­ head (40).  the extruders (12), die (42) and bulkhead (40) are  movable as a unit or separately toward and away from the  chamber to provide access to the die and the interior of the  chamber.
