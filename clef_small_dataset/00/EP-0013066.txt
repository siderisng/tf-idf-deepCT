<ABSTRACT>
copolymers useful in making electroconductive paper  which impart improved solvent holdout properties to the  electro-conductive paper comprise monomer units of quater­ nary diallyl- dialkylammonium and a monomer of the for­ mula: -ch₂=c(r₁)-c(o)-o-r₂, where r₁ is hydrogen or  methyl; r₂ is an alkyl group of 2 to 12 carbon atoms, that  number being designated n, substituted with fluorine atoms  in number equal to from n to 2n; and for the quaternary  diallyldialkylammonium monomer, the alkyl groups are simi­ lar or dissimilar alkyl groups of one of 18 carbon atoms.  certain cyano and carboxylic acyl or acylamino monomers  may be a further ingredient in making the copolymers.  electroconductive papers and electroconductive coating  color formulations contain the said copolymers.
