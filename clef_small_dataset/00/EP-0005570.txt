<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for forming a layer of emulsion-like  material of a predetermined thickness and use of the  apparatus in a method and system for making cracker paste  or puff paste, whereby a quantity of said material is  repeatedly scraped off by means of a rotatable scraping  member (31) and a portion of the desired thickness is  subsequently separated from the scraped-off quantity, the  resultant portions then being joined together one after  another so as to form the desired layer, whereby because of  the scraping-off treatment of the emulsion-like material its  structure is broken up and further treatment of the substance  is facilitated, even at lower than usual temperatures, without  there taking place a change of the desired properties of the  substance.
