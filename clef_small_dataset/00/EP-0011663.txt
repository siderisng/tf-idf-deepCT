<ABSTRACT>
oral plaque is controlled and its formation retarded by  compositions useful for dental hygiene and in the prophylaxis  of tooth decay and periodontal disease, comprising (a) tet­ radecylamine, preferably in the concentration range 0. 005-­ 0. 05 m, (b) at least one compound of zinc, aluminium, iron,  cobalt, nickel, copper, and or tin, preferably in the concentra­ tion range 0. 0005-0. 05 m: and (c) a compatible base accept­ able for oral use: the amounts of components (a) and (b) are  chosen to be effective for controlling plaque and providing a  plaque-controlling effect greater than that attributable to the  sum of the activities of each component in the absence of the  other.

<DESCRIPTION>
toilet and dental preparations and their use for oral and dental hygiene the field to which this invention relates is that of oral and dental hygiene, and of toilet and dental preparations for such hygiene purposes. t11 particular the invention relates to oral products (such as dentifrices and mouthssashes) which have antiplaque activity, i.e. those which are effective in retarding the formation of oral plaque in the mouths of users. there are already numerous prior art disclosures relating to substances with anti-plaque activity. among these are disclosures of the use of aliphatic amines, e.g. decylamine, dodecylamine, tetradecylamine and hexa decylamine, as showing such activity in tests carried out in vitro. tetradecylamine was studied separately by r.m. eying, j. dental res. (1951), 30, 399-402, in trials using tetradecylamine in medicinal paraffin. us patent no. 3,943,267 (randol) discloses use of heavy metals in treatment of tooth enamel by a process including acid-etching and heavy-metal deposition on the e-eled surfaces: the metals used include zinc, iron, cromiun, nickel, lead, cobalt, cadmium, copper, platinum, ¯l, and silver; and the process requires conversion to metal sulphides in vivo to resist decay. there are also disclosures of certain metal compounds as ingredients in such oral products as dentifrices and meuthashes 7 e.g. zinc ions (us patent no. 4,022,880 (vinson & cancro) and uk patent no. 1,373,001 (unilever) * s patent no. 3,888,976 (mlkvy and tucci)). we consider it desirable to find ways of increasing the activities of active ingredients present in anti-plaque oral hygiene compositions, so that for a given effect less of the active ingredients is required. this invention is based on the finding that the anti-plaque activity of oral products containing tetra ylamine can be enhanced by the presence of compounds of certain metals to an extent greater than that attributable to the mere presence of the metal compounds themselves: i.e. the effect is what has been called synergistic. a similar effect was sought, but not found, in mixtures in which dodecylamine or hexadecylamine was present instead the tetradecylamine as an anti-plaque agent. accordingly, by this invention, there is provided an oral composition, such as a dentifrice or a mouthwash, comprising: (a) tetradecylamine, (b) at least one compound of zinc, aluminium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt and/or tin,- and (c) a base acceptable for oral use and compatible with components (a) and (b); in which composition the tetradecylamine component (a) and metal compound component (b) are present in amounts effective for retarding plaque formation and for providing a retarding effect greater than that attributable to the sum of the plaque-retarding effects which ould be shown by each of components (a) and (b) in the absence of the other the oral compositions of this invention can take the form of mouthwashes, toothpastes, tooth powders, lozenges, dental creams and/or chewing gum. they enable plaque to be controlled when they are applied to the mouths of users, and are hence useful in the prophylaxis of tooth decay and periodontal disease. the concentration of the tetradecylamine component (a) in

 claims:    1. an oral composition comprising  (a) tetradecylamine;  (b) at least one compound of zinc, aluminium, copper,  iron, nickel, cobalt, and/or tin; aid  (c) a base acceptable for oral use and compatible  with components (a) and (b): in which composition the  tetradecylamine component (a) and the metal compound  component (b) are present in amounts effective for  retarding plaque formation and for providing a plaque  retarding effect greater than that attributable to the  sum of the plaque-retarding effects which would be   shown     by each of components (a) and (b) in the absence of the  other.    2. an oral composition eccording to claim 1, in which  the concentration of component (a) is in the range  0.005-0.05 molar.    3. an oral composition according to claim 1 or 2, in   which    the concentration of component (b) is in the  range   0.000-0.05    molar.    4. an oral composition according to claim 3, in which  component (b) comprises a zinc or an aluminium compound  at a concentration in the range 0.001-0.05 molar, or a  copper, iron,   nickel , cobalt    or tin compound at a  concentration in the range 0.0005-0.015 molar.    5. an oral composition according to claim 4, in which  component (b) comprises a compound of one of the following  metals at about the molar concentration indicated as  follows: aluminium or zinc at about 0.02; iron, nickel,  cobalt, or copper at about 0.004; or tin at about 0.002.      6. an oral composition according to claim 4 or 5 in wbich the concentration of tetradecylamine is about 0.02 molar.   7. an oral composition according to any preceding claim, in the form of a dentifrice such as a toothpaste or tooth powder; a dental cream; a mouthwash; a lozenge or a chewing gum.   8. an oral composition according to claim 7, which is a dentifrice and contains a dental abrasive compatible   with    components (a) and (b) of the composition.   9. for use in dental hygiene, or for controlling oral plaque, or retarding its formation, or in the prophylaxis of tooth decay or periodontal disease, an oral composition as defined in any one of the preceding claims.
