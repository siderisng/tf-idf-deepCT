<ABSTRACT>
a digital data processor provides separate bit and word  arithmetic and logic units 22, 20 and accumulators 18, 16 for  processing data and executing instruction on a bit or word  basis respectively.  separate instructions sets are provided for  bit and word processing.  the single bit instruction set includes  instructions for execution by the single bit alu-accumulator  set for controlling i/o operations.  the word instruction  set includes instruction for execution by the word alu-  accumulator set for data transfer and manipulation.  the address  space 12 includes a region which may be addressed on  both a bit and word basis.  each bit of the word accumulator is  addressable by the bit instructions, thereby eliminating the  need for mask operations.  an example is described for performing  a double frequency (f/2f) data separation operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
digital data processor for word and character oriented processing this invention relates to a digital data processor for word and character oriented processing, for use, for example in the control of data transfer between data handling units in a data processing system. the development of the so-called microcomputer containing a microprocessor, an instruction store, a random access storage and input/output device controllers on one monolithic integrated chip has led to the widespread use of these devices in such applications. because the microcomputer is built on a single chip, the capacity of the instruction store is necessarily small and it is desirable that this limited capacity is used efficiently. in applications such as that mentioned microcomputer functions span both data handling and input/output (i/o) control. full words in memory or registers are required for data handling, while single characters, in the form of single bits of memory or register space are frequently used for device control and it is customary in prior art systems to employ a word oriented processor and to handle single bit operations by performing a word fetch and then bit insertion into the fetched word. in many applications this does not make optimum use of instruction storage capacity. the invention is then directed to a digital data processor which will handle word oriented processes and character oriented processes with improved efficiency of hardware utilization. a digital data processor in accordance with the invention is characterised by a first arithmetic and logical unit (20) for operating on multiple character words, an accumulator (16) for storing the output of said first arithmetic and logic unit, a second arithmetic and logical unit (22) for operating on single character words, storage means (12) for storing multiple character data words, and addressing means 38, 36, 30, 26, 28, 32 for gating data words from a common portion of said storage means selectively to said first unit in a multiple character mode and to said second unit in a single character mode. by so separating the processing of single and multiple character operations considerable scope is provided for optimising the use of instruction storage. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, for handling multi-bit words and single bit words instruction execution circuits are provided to sequentially execute instructions selectively by the first and second arithmetic and logic units in response to either word or bit mode instructions. an example will be described of the use of the processor of the invention using both bit and word mode instructions in an intermixed fashion in recovery of double frequency encoded data. for this use there is provided a binary counter having at least one portion addressable on a single bit basis and a second portion addressable on a multiple bit word basis. the portion addressable on a single bit basis is used to enable a pseudo-interrupt capability for the system and the portion addressable on a multiple bit basis permits counting a window value for the double frequency encoded data separaration operation. the preferred embodiment
