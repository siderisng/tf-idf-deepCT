<ABSTRACT>
a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon  and/or carbonaceous fuel in order to yield hot gaseous pro­ ducts of relatively low pollutant content, in which the fuel is  partially burned in a first stage flame under such conditions  that the partially combusted fuel has a temperature in the  range 800 to 1600°c (e. g. , about 1150°c) and is substantially  free of smoke and/or carbon, bringing the partially com­ busted fuel at 800 to 1600°c into contact with a substantially  non-volatile catalyst (19) which is active for reducing the  amount of nox in the partially combusted fuel, and then at  least partially burning the partially combusted fuel, after con­ tact with the catalyst (19) in a second stage flame to yield the  desired low pollutant hot gaseous products.  preferably one  or both of the said flames burns in contact with a substan­ tially non-volatile catalyst (18,23) to reduce still further the  nox content of the final gaseous products.  the preferred  non-volatile catalysts (19,23) comprise either a mixture of  iron and chomium oxides or cobalt oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon andior -carbonaceous fuel the present invention relates to a method of at least partially burning a hydrocarbon and/or carbonaceous fuel. the growing concern about both energy conservation and atmospheric pollution demands that combustion systems be operated with maximum combustion efficiency (with minimum excess air) and without any emission of pollutants. the two goals, however, are not readily compatible, and indeed have proved difficult to realize. this is because any reduction in excess air to promote combustion efficiency increases smoke, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and often also oxides of nitrogen (no ). the present invention relates to a system and method in which both of the foregoing objectives can be achieved, not just with relatively clean-burning gaseous and light distillate fuels but also with fuel oils. the system and method basically involve staged combustion, as described below, in which improvements have been made in the design of the combustion system, and catalysts used in different stages. conventional staged combustion involved firing of all the fuel in the first stage with a sub-stoichimetric quantity of air and the injection in the second stage of sufficient air to complete combustion. such systems have been claimed to reduce no by ca 50%, but they usually render the x control of other pollutants, notably carbon, more difficult. according to the invention, in one aspect, fuel is partly burned in a first stage flame to yield hot substantially carbon (or smoke-)free partly-combusted fuel or first stage product, the latter being contacted with a catalyst which is active for promoting the conversion of nitrogen oxide(s) in the partly-combusted fuel or first stage product to nitrogen, the partly-combusted fuel (or first stage product), after contact with the catalyst, then being at least partially burned in a second stage flame to yield hot gaseous products having a low nitrogen oxide (and other pollutants) content. the invention, in another aspect, comprises a method of burning a hydrocarbon and/or carbonaceous fuel comprising the following steps in sequence: (a) partially burning the fuel in a first stage flame and pro ducing a substantially carbon-free or smoke free partially com busted gas phase fuel at a temperature of at least 8000c; (b) contacting the said partially combusted gaseous phase fuel with a solid, substantially non-volatile catalyst which is active for reducing the amount of nitrogen oxide(s) in the partially combusted fuel, the contacting being effected at a temperature of 0 at least 800 c; and (c) at least partially burning the partially combusted fuel in a second stage flame to yield hot gaseous products of relatively low pollutant content. the temperature at which the partly-combusted fuel or first-stage product contacts the catalyst may be in the range of from 800 to 16000c, preferably 900 to 14000c, more preferably 10000c to 13000c, although the actual temperature will depend upon the fuel and on the amount of oxygen supplied for combustion in the first stage flame, and on the amount of nitrogen introduced with the
