<ABSTRACT>
in a static inverter for providing a low-frequency out­ put (e. g.  60hz) from a d. c.  supply (q), the passage of low-­ frequency currents through the inverter transformer (p) is  avoided by producing a train of high-frequency pulses (e. g.   40khz) which represent, for example by their pulse widths  (4), the successive instantaneous amplitudes of the requi­ red low-frequency voltage.  these pulses cause a train of  corresponding pulses (7) to be produced at the secondary  of the transformer, and this train is filtered (h) to produce  a unidirectional voltage (9) having the desired instantane­ ous amplitudes.  this voltage is fed to a transistor switching  bridge (1) which changes the unidirectional voltage into an  alternating voltage (12) having the required low-frequency.   means (n, e, l, m) is preferably provided to allow regene­ ration of power from the load back into the d. c.  supply (q).
