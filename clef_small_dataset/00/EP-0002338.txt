<ABSTRACT>
a web transport mechanism suitable for transporting film in cameras or projectors includes inner and outer tracks defining between them an endless path.  the inner track is driven so as to cause a flexible member which is located between the tracks and in engagement therewith to roll around the outer track.  the engagement between the flexible member of the track is maintained by the resilience of the flexible member in one embodiment and by magnetic forces in another embodiment.  a web support surface is provided adjacent the track and arranged so that the flexible member rolls over this surface as it moves around its path.  film supply and take-up means are disposed at positions upstream and downstream (with respect to the direction of movement of the member) of the surface.  each time the member moves around its path, it successively moves a portion of the web into contact with the surface, holds it against the surface and releases it to permit a fresh portion of web to be moved into contact with, held against and released from the surface.  several flexible members may be provided in the path at spaced apart positions.  synchronizing means may be employed to ensure synchronized station of the movement of the member or members.
