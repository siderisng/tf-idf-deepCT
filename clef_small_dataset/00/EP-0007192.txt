<ABSTRACT>
a process for manufacturing a heterojunction device, for  example a solar cell, comprises placing an n-type silicon  semi-conductor body (3) in a vacuum chamber (6); also plac­ ing in the chamber (6) a vessel (4) containing tin oxide or a  mixture of tin oxide and indium oxide; evacuating the  chamber (6); generating, such as by an electron beam (7), a  stream (9) of oxide vapor; and directing the stream (9) into the  silicon body (3) at an angle of incidence (ϑ) which is so  selected, generally in the range 40° to 70°, as to provide  substantially maximum efficiency of the device.  the coated  substrate is heated and thereafter metal electrodes are depo­ sited on the coated substrate.  a solar cell of sunlight  conversion-efficiency above 5% is consistently obtainable by  the process.
