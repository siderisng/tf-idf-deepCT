<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the field of bipolar transistors to operate at high voltages, exceeding 100 v.  the simultaneous production of these transistors of the various known types, i. e.  pnp, lateral and non-lateral pnp and 12l, with a view to combining them by monolithic integration on one and the same substrate, meets with great difficulties on account of the incompatibilities between certain common production stages.  according to the invention, in order to surmount them in the pnp and lateral pnp devices, two supplementary regions are created at a high doping level of sign n, one at the emitter junction (32) and the other at the collector junction (25).  these devices are employed, in particular, in high voltage integrated circuits incorporating a high degree of integration.  <image>
