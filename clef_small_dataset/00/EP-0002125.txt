<ABSTRACT>
a centrifugal separator for and a method of separating  the constituents of a fluid mixture wherein the mixture is  introduced into a separating means (12), preferably a container,  and the separating means is rotated about its own  first (19) and simultaneously in planetary fashion about a  second offset axis (28) to separate the constituents by  centrifugal action, due to rotation about the second offset  axis (28), the first axis (19) and the second offset axis  (28) being disposed in non-parallel relationship to one  another and a separated constituent being thrown out of  an open end of the separating means (12) under centrifugal  action due to rotation of the separating means (12) about  the second offset axis (28) without removal means being  required within the separating means (12).  in a preferred  arrangement the second offset axis (28) is substantially  vertical and the first axis (19) lies at an acute angle to the  vertical.
