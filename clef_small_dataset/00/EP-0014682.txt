<ABSTRACT>
the present invention concerns a panel that absorbs  solar energy that is emplaced as conventional inclined roof  tiles with an esthetic effect comparable to that of a tile roof.   the invention comprises a metallic or non-metallic tile (2)  preferably blackened, having at least one raised portion (4)  that collects heat, in which may be provided a throat (3) that  forms a seat for a metallic tube (5) through which flows the  fluid to be heated.  a transparent cap (7) covers, insulates and  protects the raised portion (4) of the tile and the tube.  the tile  preferably has on its upper surface protuberances (9).  the  lower cavities are interconnected by conduits permitting cirÂ­ culation of the air contained therein so as to transport heat  toward the raised collector portion (4) which thus directly  absorbs the solar heat.
