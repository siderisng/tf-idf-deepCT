<ABSTRACT>
apparatus (30) for collecting sheets in which the sheets  are collected in a sheet receiving bin (32).  a pneumatic system  (not shown) moves a guide (44) from a first position to a  second position.  in the first position, the guide (44) is inoperaÂ­ tive and the sheet is transported past the bin (32).  contrawise,  in the second position, the guide (44) is operative and the  sheet is collected in the bin (32).  in one configuration the  apparatus comprises a sorter having a plurality of bins (32)  and guides (44) associated with each of the bins (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for collecting sheets this invention relates to apparatus for collecting sheets including at least one sheet receiving bin, a transport for delivering sheets to the bin and a guide for guiding sheets from the transport into the bin. frequently, it-is highly desirable to reproduce a plurality of copies of the same original document. moreover, if several original documents are reproduced, it is desirable to form a plurality of collated sets of copies. this may be achieved by the utilization of a sorting apparatus. generally, the sorting apparatus comprises a plurality of bins wherein each bin is designed to collect one set of copies of the original documents. a variety of sorters are known in the art. one typical sorter employs tray members which are spaced apart and extending in a linear row. another type of sorting apparatus has tray members extending radially outwardly from the axis of rotation. these are the two basic types of sorters generally used commercially, i.e. a linear type and a rotary type. copy sheets may be collected in the bins of the sorter in a number of ways. the most common technique is to utilize a sheet transport to advance the copy sheets past the bin openings and deflection fingers to guide the sheets from the transport into the respective bin. another technique comprises the use of moving deflection fingers which move from bin to bin to deflect the copy sheets into the respective bin. yet scjll another approach is to move the bins past the sheet ejecting port & n of the transport. in this way, the bins collect successive sheets therein. however, in all of the foregoing types of systems, the bins are articulated by a mechanical or electro-mechanical system. various types of devices have herein before been employed to control the movement of sorter bins. thus japanese publication no. 53-151#5 discloses a sheet sorting unit comprising a plurality of bin trays. a pawl and lever system open successive trays to receive copy sheets. and british patent no. 1,486,166 describes a sorting apparatus having a plurality of sheet receiving trays positioned horizontally above each other. a motor and cam system articulates successive trays into the sheet path to receive the sheets therein. tulle present invention is characterised by pneumatic mechanism, coupled to the guide for moving the guide from a first position in which it is inoperative to guide tile sheets from the transport into the bin to a second pcsition in which it is operative to guide the sheet from the transport into the bin. in order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a schematic elevational view of an electrophotographic printing machine having a sorting apparatus according to the invention coupled thereto; figure 2 is a fragmentary perspective view of one embodiment of the figure 1 sorting apparatus; figure 3 is a fragmentary schematic elevational view of another embodiment of the figure 1 sorting apparatus;
