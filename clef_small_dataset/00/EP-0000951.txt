<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the use in medicine of 1-alkylimidazoles  of formula    in which a is a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated  acyclic hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms;  n is 0 or 1; and r is a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl radical of  from 4 to 9 carbon atoms and optionally substituted by  one, two, three or more alkyl radicals each containing from  1 to 4 carbon atoms, or, when n is 1, a and r together form  an alkyl radical of from 4 to 7 carbon atoms or an alkenyl  or alkynyl radical of from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, the imidazole  being the free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt  thereof.  the 1-alkylimidazoles in which n is 0 and r ist cycloalkyl  or cycloalkenyl are novel, as are those when a and r  together form an alkenyl radical.  methods of preparing the 1-alkylimidazoles are disclosed.  the 1-alkylimidazoles have pharmacological properties  of use in medicine, in particular for the treatment or prophylaxis  of thrombo-embolic disorders.
