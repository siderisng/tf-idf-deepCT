<ABSTRACT>
1.  claims for the contracting states : be, ch, fr, gb, it, lu, il, nl and se a process for the production of unsaturated polyesters which contain imide groups by reacting compounds containing imide groups which correspond to the following formula  see diagramm : ep0013397,p5,f1  wherein r represents a mono- or bicyclic aromatic or cycloaliphatic and/or an aliphatic radical, which may be unsubstituted or substituted by methyl groups and/or halogen atoms, on which both the carboxyl radicals which are capable of forming anhydrides are at the 1,2- or 1,3-position, r1 represents a simple aliphatic group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and a represents a hydroxy or carboxyl group, with unsaturated and optionally in addition saturated multibasic carboxylic acids, or the anhydrides thereof and compounds containing hydroxyl groups, characterised in that hydroxy functional unsaturated oils are used as a starting product in a quantity of from 5 to 60%, by weight, based on the total weight of the polyester.  1.  claims for the contracting state : at a process for the production of unsaturated polyesters which contain imide groups by reacting compounds which contain imide groups and which correspond to the following formula  see diagramm : ep0013397,p6,f2  wherein r represents a mono- or bicyclic aromatic or cycloaliphatic and/or an aliphatic radical, which may be unsubstituted or substituted by methyl groups and/or halogen atoms, on which both the carboxyl radicals which are capable of forming anhydrides are at the 1,2- or 1,3-position, r1 represents a simple aliphatic group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and a represents a hydroxy or carboxyl group, with unsaturated and optionally in addition saturated multibasic carboxylic acids, or the anhydrides thereof and compounds which contain hydroxyl groups, characterised in that hydroxy functional unsaturated oils, are used as a starting product in a quantity of from 5 to 60%, by weight, based on the total weight of the polyester.
