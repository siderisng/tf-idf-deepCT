<ABSTRACT>
a system is provided for monitoring sputtering deposition  parameters and, through closed-loop control, achieving  rapid modification of the parameters to maintain or to obtain  a desired film composition.  in reactive sputtering, the  sputtering chamber (10) has individual gas pressure controllers  (18, 19) for the various gases to be added to the  chamber.  a holder for a substrate (13) on which the film is to  be deposited includes a heater with adjustable control (15).  a  differentially pumped quadrupole mass analyzer (23) interconnects  with the chamber (10) to receive a sample of  plasma ions, measures the ionized species existing in the  plasma and generates signals related to the composition of  the deposited film.  a controller (24) responsive to the  quadrupole analyzer actuation and under control of a central  processor (25) adjusts the pressure of the one or more  reactive or non-reactive gases being provided to the chamber,  and/or controls other deposition parameters, such as  substrate temperature or other plasma features.
