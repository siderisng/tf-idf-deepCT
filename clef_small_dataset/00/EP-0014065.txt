<ABSTRACT>
a system creates a control reference signal for a re­ mote electrical servo device having a movable output unit  wherein the velocity and position of the output unit are  controlled by the magnitude of the control reference sig­ nal.  this system includes a digital circuit for creating a first  fixed analog signal (22) indicative of a known or desired  velocity for the unit during a preselected controlled time in­ terval and a second digital means for creating a desired  time base positional profile (32) during the preselected  time interval.  an encoder arrangement is employed for de­ tecting the actual time base positional profile (34) of the  servo output unit during the given time interval so that an  analog signal (24) generally proportional to the algebraic  difference between the actual and desired time base posi­ tional digital profile can be created at various times during  the time interval.  the control reference signal is then  created by a summing circuit (5) as a function of both the  first and second analog signals the first of which is propor­ tional to a desired velocity and the second of which is pro­ portional to the algebraic difference between a desired and  actual position of the servo output unit.
