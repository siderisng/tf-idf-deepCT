<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drill head of a drilling tool with a spanzmaul for chip removal and a plurality of their cutting in an axis plane, step-shaped arranged, the spanning sliding slabs. The aim of the invention is to form a drill head with a main cutting edge divided by using multiple cutting plates so that the individual cutting plates support each other for securing a stable position of their active cutting edges and a radial adjustability of the individual cutting plates overall by means of an adjusting device acting on the axial cutting plate is possible. The object of the invention is therefore to form the head of a drilling tool so that the main pitch formed by a plurality of cutting plates has a chip divider stage and the individual cutting plates to support each other for securing the stable location of their cutting edges and a radial adjustability of the individual cutting plates overall a adjusting device acting on the axial cutting plate is possible. This is essentially achieved by arranging a parallelogram shape, flat against each other and against a rear shoulder (13) applied parallel to each other main cutting edges inserting cutting plates (3,4) by means of sliding guides (5,6,7) radially adjustable.
