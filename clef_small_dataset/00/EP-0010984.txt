<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a membrane assembly and  processes for the utilization of the membrane assembly, or  membrane assemblies having like properties.  the mem­ brane assembly (10) comprises intermixed layers of capillary  material (11) and high dielectric constant impermeable ma­ terial (13), forming capillary channels parallel to the direc­ tion of ion transport through the membrane.  the membrane  is anion permeable, does not have membrane potential and  will not foul even over extended operation, allows cross-flow  of anions and cations, and is highly efficient.  it is possible to  remove complex metals from any contaminated acid by elec­ trodialysis, such as removing vanadium and uranium in re­ coverable form from contaminated phosphoric acid, while  producing food grade phosphoric acid in the process.  addi­ tionally, simple metals may be removed from mine waste li­ quids (from leaching), chlorine can be produced from a  chloride containing salt, and chromium can be removed from  chromium contaminated water by electrolysis.  milling sludge  can be treated to form water, caustic, and acid, and mineral­ ized water can be treated to form de-mineralized water, by  subjecting the feed liquids to electrodialysis.
