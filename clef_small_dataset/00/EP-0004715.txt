<ABSTRACT>
a tire building machine of the expandable bead lock type  employs an elastomeric specially shaped radially expanding  bead lock (52, 53) which includes an air passage system  therethrough.  the bead locks are expanded by a pneumatic  tube (137) which seats the bead lock against reentrant  shoulder stops securing the bead locks in their expanded  condition both precisely radially and axially with respect to  the two centerlines of the machine.  such bead locks may be  used in connection with an expandable axially fixed center  deck (39) for first stage operations or in connection with a  substantially rigid axially expandable and contractible center  deck for single stage operations.  the bead locks may also be  employed for second stage operations.  for a single stage  machine, the preferred form of center deck includes axially  oppositely extending fingers which slide in respective slots  in the center support forming a substantially rigid working  surface.  in connection with single and first stage operations,  the bead locks may include integrally formed shaping  bladders (48) which are inflated through the air passage  system in the bead locks.  an additional (49) bladder may be  employed at each end of the machine cooperating with the  bladder formed integrally with the bead locks for turning tire  components about the beads and for assembling components  such as sidewalls to the carcass when in a toroidal  shape.  the bladders are specially constructed and molded so  that the components may be wrapped or applied tangentially  and sequentially from the bead outwardly to avoid distortion.   components of the machine, whether used as a single  stage, first stage, or second stage machine are common.
