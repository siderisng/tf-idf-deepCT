<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a liquid separating and evacuat­ ing device for fluid suction equipment and, in particular, for  dental surgery equipment, with which it is possible to sepa­ rate the air from the liquids and to continuously drain the  latter without interrupting the suction.  the said device consists essentially of a cylindrical con­ tainer (2), placed on a vertical axis, that is provided on the  bottom part thereof with a draining valve (18).  placed inside  the said container there is a horizontal partition (4) that is  divided into two superposed chambers.  this partition has a  valve (16) which either allows or prevents the liquid to pass  from the first chamber (5) to the second chamber (6).  a float (23) contained in the first chamber (5) controls, by  actuating a pneumatic distributor (20), the opening and the  closing of the valves (16) and (18) which successively allow  the liquid to pass from the first chamber to the second  chamber and from the latter to the outside.
