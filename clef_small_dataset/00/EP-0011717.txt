<ABSTRACT>
a bubble domain memory system having one or more  major/minor loop arrays is disclosed.  the bubble domain  memory system has a plurality of minor loops (20a-20n) for  the storage of data bits including some minor loops which  are defective.  a plurality of pointers are provided to identify  the defective minor loops.  at least one block of bits in each  major/minor loop array is reserved for the storage of the  pointers.  the pointer block is associated with a fast access  read write memory (28), for example, a volatile random-Â­ access read/write memory system, to which the pointer  information is transferred during power-on initialization of  the bubble domain memory system.  during the read/write  operations of the bubble domain memory system, the  read/write memory system enables the data positions to be  skipped that correspond to the defective loops.
