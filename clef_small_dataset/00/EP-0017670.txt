<ABSTRACT>
a method is provided to facilitate the exchange of data  between a direct access storage device (dasd) (14) and  a central processing unit (cpu) (11).  the data is stored  in fixed length records on the dasd.  a pair of sequential commands are issued by the cpu  to control access to the dasd data.  the first command  contains information which defines the boundaries of the  dasd storage space which the cpu can access.  the second  command identifies the operation to be carried out within  the permitted space defined in the first command and esÂ­ tablishes where within the permitted space the activity is to  take place.  the use of these two commands reduces the amount  of cpu software involvement which is required for data  accessing, particularly where the accessing involves the  crossing of geometrical boundaries on the dasd.
