<ABSTRACT>
a road vehicle electrical system includes a digitally  controlled multiplex system whereby load devices destributed  around the vehicle are controlled by signals from a  transmitter connected to a plurality of receivers each controlling  a group of load control devices.  the transmitter  produces a pulse train divider into digital words each word  including one set of bits identifying an address of a receiver  and another set identifying an instruction code for  the loads controlled by that receiver and determined by  switches operable by the driver.  each receiver includes an  address identification circuit and a storage device for the  instruction code.  a receiver acts on an instruction code  only if the same instruction code is received in two successive  cycles of the transmitter.
