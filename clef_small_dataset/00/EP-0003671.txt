<ABSTRACT>
a stoma adaptor (1) comprising an open tube (2) of  non-toxic material, having a proximal end (3) for insertion  into the lumen of a body orifice (4) at a stoma site; a distal  end at which the rim is turned outwards to form an annular  lip (6) having a concave underside (7) geometrically continuous  with the rest of the tube whereby an open live  intestine advanced over the tube from the proximal end  will take up a similarly flared configuration for attachment  to the external periphery of the orifice; means for securing  an open intestine to the outer surface of the tube; means  for securing the tube to the body wall (5); and means for  attachment to the tube at the distal end thereof, of a fluid-tight  stoma closure.
