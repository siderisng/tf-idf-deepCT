<ABSTRACT>
a bag support and dispensing apparatus including a  sleeve (3) that is passed through aligned apertures in a stack  of bags to support the bags.  a collar at the back end of the  sleeve is detachably engaged with a support member (7).   the forward end of the sleeve has a flange (5) that is  dimensioned to readily pass through an enlarged aperture  (9) in the top portion of the front wall of a bag when the front  wall of the bag is pulled in a forward direction.  the flange is  also dimensioned to resist passing through a smaller  aperture (11) in the top portion of the back wall of the bag to  allow the bag to be held in an open position for receiving  articles.  a loaded bag is disengaged from the sleeve by  pulling the bag in a forward direction with sufficient force to  distend the smaller rear aperture so that the flange passes  through the smaller aperture to release the back wall of the  loaded bag.  the sleeve is disengaged from the support  member after all of the bags have been removed and  thereafter a new stack of bags is slipped over the sleeve and  the sleeve is re-engaged with the support member.
