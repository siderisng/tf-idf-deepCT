<ABSTRACT>
1.  level switch, particularly for motor vehicles, for monitoring a liquid level in a vessel, with a float which sits via a flexible intermediate piece on a flange which can be fastened on the vessel and with a position-dependent switch contact, particularly a mercury relay, which is connected operatively to the float, characterised in that the intermediate piece (1) comprises two parts (2, 3; 17, 19) which are connected by a film hinge (4, 22) and one (2, 17) of which is connected to the flange (5, 16) and the other (3, 19) to the float (12, 20) in that two clamping projections (9, 10) for the switch contact (8, 21) are provided on that part (3, 19) of the intermediate piece (1) which is connected to the float (12, 20), in that the float (12, 20) consists of a hollow body and of a cover (13) and in that the intermediate piece (1), the flange (5, 16), the clamping projections (9, 10) and the hollow body or the cover (13) constitute a one-piece unit made of plastics.
