<ABSTRACT>
in a dual-standard pal/secam color tv reciever, an  identification system (15) provides a mode-switching output,  permitting automatic switching (17) of the receiver between a  pal-reception mode of operation and a secam-reception  operating mode, in dependence upon the pal or secam  nature of the transmission received.  in the secam-reception  mode, a pal decoder (19) receives the chrominance compo­ nent output of a secam-pal transcoder (13); in the pal-­ reception mode, the pal decoder receives (via 21) chromi­ nance signals which bypass the transcoder (13).  to equalise  the signal delays in the chrominance and luminance signal  channels of the receiver in the two operating modes, the  luminance channels includes a switchable luminance signal  delay line (33) in cascade with a chrominance component trap  circuit (60, 80).  the switchable delay line (33) is controlled by  the mode-switching output of the identification system (15)  such that delay line (33) is interposed in luminance signal path  only during secam-reception mode operation.  the delay  magnitude provided by delay line substantially matches dif­ ference in delays suffered by chrominance information during  operation in the respective modes.  the trap circuit, (60, 80)  providing luminance delay substantially compensating the  delay suffered by chrominance information during operation  in pal-reception modo, includes resonant circuits (60, 80)  tuned respectively to the two secam subcarrier resting fre­ quencies.
