<ABSTRACT>
for developing double-sided x-ray film whether in  piece or strip form, the film is passed through a series of  tanks in each of which it is held between two bands (27  and 28) of woven plastics material which pass between  scraper bars (37) and are driven by grooved rollers (29,  30 and 32), the roller (33) being an idler.  the scraper bars  guide the bands in a sinuous path to ensure close contact  between the bands and also squeeze processing liquid  through the permeable bands, which are kept clean by the  scraping action.  the film enters between rollers (29 and  33) and is delivered between rollers (30 and 32) ans is  firmly held throughout.  the scraper bars are cheaper and  more efficient, in conjunction with the bands, than the conventional  transport rollers.
