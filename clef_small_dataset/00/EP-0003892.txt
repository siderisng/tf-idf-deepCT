<ABSTRACT>
β-lactam compounds of the formulae    are disclosed in which r represents a carboxyl or esterified  carboxyl group and x represents a sulphonyloxy group.  processes  for preparing the compounds and intermediates of  use in their preparation are also disclosed.  the compounds are of value in the preparation of  further β-lactam compounds, for example of formulae    in which r is a carboxyl or esterified carboxyl group, and r¹  is the residue of a sulphur nucleophile.  compounds of formula (i) are also disclosed, together  with processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions  containing them and intermediates of use in their  preparation.  the compounds of formula (i) are of value as  antibiotics or as β-lactamase inhibitors.
