<ABSTRACT>
olefine polymer or copolymer insulation may be applied directly to untinned copper conductors and cross-linked in contact therewith without severe oxidation damage if the cross-linkage copolymer contains from 0. 5 to 10 parts by weight of zinc sulphide.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to improved cross-linked or cross-linkable olefine polymer electrical insulating materials especially olefine polymer elastomer compositions. the invention also relates to the use of such compositions for the insulation of copper and to copper so insulated. elastomers such as ethylene propylene co- and ter-polymers (epm and epdm) are widely used as electrical insulation for copper conductors but these elastomers tend to be degraded by contact with copper leading to breakdown of the insulation or in certain instances the insulant sticking to the copper which in the case of copper wire can prevent it being stripped therefrom to make connections. in particular the copper tends to degrade the insulant when hot and since elastomers are generally extruded onto the copper as compo scions containing a cross linking agent and then heat soaked in contact with the conductor to effect crosslinking the insulation can become degraded and stick to the wire before the cable is used. it has therefore been common practice to coat the copper wire with a layer of tin to prevent contact between the copper and the elastomeric insulating material. with the increase in price of tin this has become a very expensive technique as well as requiring the undesirable step of coating the wire. it has been proposed to include free radical scavenger antioxidants such as 2mercaptobenzoimidazoie in an elastomeric insulant to stabilise against copper degradation. these materials are however expensive and can have disadvantages with insulants which are cross-linkcd or cured in contact with the conductor since these insulants usually contain peroxide catalysts to effect cross-linking and the presence of a free radical scavenger reduces the potency of the peroxide and thus nore of it is required with further increases to the costs. it is an aim of the present invention to provide a simple, cheap technique whereby the above mentioned problems are overcome and which allows an olefine polymer cross-linkable elastomeric insultant to be applied directly to untinned copper conductors and cross-linked in contact therewith without unacceptable oxidative degradation of the insultant. the present invention therefore provides a cross-linkable composition stabilized for direct contact with copper comprising an olefine polymer or copolymer containing from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of the composition of zinc sulphide and from 1 to 5 parts by weight of a cross-linking agent per 100 parts of the olefine polymer or copolymer. it has been proposed in united kingdom patent 1194968 that zinc sulphide may be included in olefine polymers to improve their stability against copper induced degradation. there is however no suggestion that the olefine polymer be cross-linked in contact with the copper. we have found that the presence of the zinc sulphide inhibits oxidation degradation of the olefine polymer when in contact with copper so allowing the insulant to be applied directly to copper wire without needing to coat the wire with tin. in addition we find that the presence of zinc sulphide in insulating formulations containing a cross-linking agent does not interfere with the operation
