<ABSTRACT>
a pressure vessel such as a steam cooker (10) is provided  with a door closure comprising a horizontally disposed door  mounting and actuating member (20) pivotally mounted for  swinging movement across an access opening (12) of the  vessel and supporting a warped door (18) for movement into  and out of the opening.  a rotationally and axially movable  shaft (60) carried in the door mounting member (20) has a cam  (96) and follower (92) associated therewith for moving the  shaft axially in response to rotation thereof.  the door (18) is  coupled to the shaft (60) by a mechanism which shifts the door  laterally with respect to the door mounting member and also  causes translational movement of the door toward and away  from the mounting member in response to rotation of the  shaft so that the door can be inserted through the opening in a  warped condition and then be unwarped to seal against the  inside of the opening without requiring an operator to exert a  lateral force on the door closure.
