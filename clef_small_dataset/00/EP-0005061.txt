<ABSTRACT>
for a tent that is readily collapsible, erectible and portable, there is provided a roof structure.  the structure has collapsible roof struts (30).  each strut (30) has a first strut member (31) and a second strut member (33) where are pivotally connected to a respective one of first and second central carrier members (11, 13).  these central carrier members (11, 13) are arranged for relative displacement towards each other.  axial coupling means (22) align axially the central carrier members (11, 13) in a first position and in which the collapsible roof struts (30) extend outwardly from said first and second central carrier members (11, 13).  in their second position the carrier members (11, 13) are axially displaced from one another to enable said struts (30) to adopt a folded attitude in which the first and second strut members (31, 33) extend substantially axially of the first and second carrier members (11, 13).  each central carrier member (11, 13) is a plate-like member (12) with a central aperture (24) and a plurality of angularly spaced compartments (26).  first and second abutments (27, 28) on each compartment (26) to limit the movement of a respective strut member (31, 33) beyond the position occupied by that member in the first and second positions of the carrier members (11, 13).
