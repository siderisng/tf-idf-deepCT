<ABSTRACT>
irradiated regions (28) are formed in materials such as  semiconductor bodies by nuclear radiation (23′) where the  irradiated regions (28) are of a desired thickness, dosage and  dosage gradient, a desired distance from a selected surface  (11) of the material.  a nuclear radiation beam (23′) from a  given radiation source radiating particles with molecular  weight of at least one (1) is provided that can penetrate the  material through a selected surface (11) to a depth greater  than the maximum depth of the irradiated region from the  selected surface.  a beam modifier (26) of a given material and  non-uniform shape to modify the energy of the radiation  beam (23) is interposed between the source and the material  to form a transmitted radiation beam (23′) capable of forming  an irradiated region (28) of a desired thickness and dosage  gradient in the material a given distance from the selected  surface on irradiation of the material through the selected  surface (11) with the transmitted radiation beam.
