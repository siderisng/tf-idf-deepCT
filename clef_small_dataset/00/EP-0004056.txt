<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pressure-controlled water supply system. In such systems, a pressure accumulator (9) is arranged between a supply line (5) and a withdrawing line (8). Between the feed line connected to the feed pump and the pressure accumulator, a membrane (2) is provided which controls a pressure switch (12) which turns on and off the conveyor pump. In order to achieve a compact embodiment of the plant parts, it is proposed according to the invention to arrange the membrane (2) directly in the flow of the water and to be provided with a passage opening (4). The size of the passage opening (4) is dimensioned with respect to the delivery rate of the pump so that a pressure difference arises to it. Further, on the side of the membrane (2) facing the pressure accumulator (9), a check valve is disposed over the passage opening (4), so that the membrane (2) itself forms the seat for the check valve (6). Above the diaphragm surface, the mouth of a line (13) leading to the pressure switch (12) is arranged. The distance (14) of the mouth to the diaphragm surface is chosen so that the membrane (2) rests on the mouth due to a pressure difference during deflection due to a pressure difference. Pressure-controlled water supply systems of the type described are used to supply properties that are not connected to no public water supply network.
