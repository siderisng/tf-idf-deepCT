<ABSTRACT>
a test piece is immersed in an electroless plating bath.   it is then electrically charged instantaneously via a counter  electrode to have a polarization potential n(t) of a few milli­ volts.  the charge consumed by the electroless plating re­ action of the test piece is measured by a potential recorder  in the form of a variation of the polarization potential n(t)  with respect to time t.  the n(t)-t relation is analyzed to  obtain a resistance r of the test piece.  after the potential  of the test piece has returns to electroless deposition po­ tential eelp, the test piece is charged again until its polari­ zation potential n(t) rises to 50 millivolts or more.  a n(t)-t  relation is obtained.  based on the n(t)-t relation, a tafel  slope βa of anodic reaction is obtained.  after the potential  of the test piece has returned to electroless deposition po­ tential eelp, the test piece is so charged for the third time  as to have its polarization potential n(t) lowered to -50 mil­ livolts or less, and a n(t)-t relation is obtained.  this relation  th is analyzed to obtain a tafel slope βc of anodic reaction of  the test piece.  based on the reaction resistance r, tafel  slopes βa and βc, an electroless plating current density ielp  is obtained.  based on the electroless plating current densi­ ty ielp, a rate of electroless plating velp is calculated.
