<ABSTRACT>
1.  a sliding door with a vertical sealing device and with profiled rails (11) disposed along both the vertical edges of a door leaf (1) wherein the two vertical profiled rails (11) are identically designed h-profile rails with undercut t-shaped grooves (4) for inserting profiled rubber strips (3, 9), and wherein a profiled rubber rail (9) with a laterally projecting flexible sealing flange (12) is inserted in the profiled rail at the rear edge of the door leaf, characterized in that the profiled rubber strip (3) at the leading edge of the door leaf is less wide in its section which projects out of the profiled rail (11) than in its section which projects into the profiled rail, the cross-section of the foremost section (5) is approximately circular shaped with a cylindrical hollow space (6) behind which ther is a second hollow space (7), the profiled rubber rail (9) at the rear vertical edge of the door leaf is designed as a buffer with a hollow space (13), and in the closed state the sealing flange (12) rests flexibly against a sealing strip on the locationaly fixed part.
