<ABSTRACT>
an infra-red radiation detector element and its manufac­ ture is disclosed.  the detector element has a mesa (31) of  infra-red sensitive material, o. g.  cadmium mercury telluride  with separate metal electrodes (64 and 55, )  formed on side-walls of the mesa (31) from a metal layer 33.   this permits a significant proportion of the current flow occur­ ring between the electrodes (64 and 55) in operation of the  element to pass across the bulk of the mesa (31) between its  side-walls and not adjacent its top surface where the carrier  recombination velocity may be higher.  the mesa (31) is  formed by ion-etching using a masking layer (24) e. g.  of  photoresist, and this permits reproducible etching over a  uniform depth and the obtaining of a topographically rough  surface to which the subsequently-deposited metal layer (33)  can have good adhesion.  the electrodes are formed from this  layer (33) by a lift-off technique using the same masking layer  (24).  the ion-etch definition of the mesa (31) can also be used  to etch unmasked parts of a passivating layer (14) on the  element surface without any significant undercutting.  it is suggested that figure no.  12 should accompany the  abstract when published.
