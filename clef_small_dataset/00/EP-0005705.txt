according to the invention, a terrestrial optical telescope is characterised in that it comprises at least one first concave mirror (1) directed towards an object to be observed, a second concave mirror (7), the axis (8) of which intersects that (6) of said first concave mirror and a first plane mirror (4) of small size, which plane mirror is disposed at the point of conjunction of the axes (6) and (8) of said concave mirrors (1) and (7), the latter facing said plane mirror (4) and being disposed in such a manner that the image plane of said first concave mirror (1) is situated at the location of said first plane mirror (4) and that the latter deflects said image towards the second concave mirror (7), which transmits it to the eye piece (9).  application to the production of binoculars.  <image>
