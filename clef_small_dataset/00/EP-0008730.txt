<ABSTRACT>
a method for the assembly of electric motors of the  printed type having a printed armature (18) that rotates in a  flat, annular air gap (70) between a magnet assembly (12) and  a magnetic flux plate (16), wherein the size (d) of the air gap  (70) is accurately maintained at preselected value.  in one  embodiment of the invention, a precision shim, having a  thickness (d) the same as the preselected air gap size, is  placed on a flat work surface, the magnet assembly (12) is  placed on the shim (48), and a motor housing (10) is placed  over the magnet assembly (12) and shim.  an epoxy fill (52) in  the housing (10) is compressed as the housing is pressed  down over the magnet assembly (12) until a reference surface  (46) on the housing (10) contacts the work surface.  in an  alternate embodiment of the invention, an inner flux plate is  formed to include a plurality of tines, so shaped and sized that,  when the inner flux plate and the magnet assembly (12) are  bonded together and inserted in the housing (10), the tines  provide for a force fit in the housing (10).  the magnet assemÂ­ bly (12) and inner flux plate are pressed into the housing (10)  by a press tool with lugs that project from a flat surface of the  tool by a distance (d) equal to the preselected size of the air  gap.  the method can be generally used for assembling electric  motors of small overall size and high torque, especially for  drive motors for tape transport apparatus.
