<ABSTRACT>
To cool a punching head with a plurality of matri X-like punched needles (92), which are individually selectable by means of associated electromagnets (54) to form the punch pattern, a continuous cooling system, preferably with liquid cooling serves.The cooling system consists of a plurality between the holes (52, 58) for the punch needles (92) and its magnets (54) arranged deep in the punch head housing (50) deep into the punching head housing (50), in which a tube (72) protrudes concentrically and is connected so that the cooling liquid from an inner distributor chamber (74) in countercurrent through the tubes (72) and holes (64) is continuously passed into an outer distributor chamber (76).
