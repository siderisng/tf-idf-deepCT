<ABSTRACT>
in a building having a layer of thermal insulating material, for example mineral wool, the wind stop outside of the insulating material and the steam stop inside the thermal insulating material are united to completely airtight enclose the insulating material.  all joints in the stops and between the stops are cemented to provide for airtightness.  both the steam stop (the diffusion stop) and the wind stop are made up by strong tough paper.  jointing tape having thermal cement coating on one side and an electric iron are used for making the airtight joints.  the wind stop of the walls and the roof are preferably united to form one single layer for the entire building.
