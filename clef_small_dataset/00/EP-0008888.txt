<ABSTRACT>
the compounds of the formula (ii):    and salts and esters thereof wherein r₁ is a lower alkyl  group, an aralkyl group or is a lower alkyl group substituted  on other than the carbon atom to which the sulphur atom is  attached by a co₂r₃, or₄, n(r₅)cor₆, n(r₅)co₂r₆ or  n(r₅)r₇ group or by a co₂r₃ and a n(r₅)cor₆ group  wherein r₃ is a group such that co₂r₃ is a carboxylic acid  group or a salt or lower alkyl or benzyl ester thereof; r₄ is a  hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl, lower acyl, benzyloxycarbonyl  or p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group or a conr₈r₉  group, r₅ is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; r₆ is a  lower alkyl, benzyl or p-nitrobenzyl group; r₇ is a hydrogen  atom or a lower alkyl aralkyl, benzhydryl or trityl group; r₈ is  a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl or phenyl group; r₉ is a  hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; and r₂ is a hydrogen  atom or an azidoloweralkyl group or a group cr₁₀r₁₁r₁₂  wherein r₁₀ is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group; r₁₁ is a  hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; and r₁₂ is a hydrogen  atom, loweracyloxyloweralkyl group, hydroxyloweralkyl  group, lower alkyl group, a benzyl group, a phenyl group or  is joined to r₁₁ to form part of a c5-7 carbocylic ring or is a  group of the formula ch(oh)r₁₃ or chx wherein r₁₃ is a  hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group and x is an oxygen atom  or a cr₁₄r₁₅ group where r₁₄ is a hydrogen atom or a lower  alkyl, phenyl, cn,co₂r₁₆ or co. r₁₆ group where r₁₆ is  lower alkyl, phenyl or benzyl group and r₁₅ is a hydrogen  atom or a lower alkyl group or is joined to r₁₄ to form part of  a c5-7 carbocyclic ring; except all isomers of thienamycin and  except compounds wherein r₂ is ethyl or 1-hydroxyethyl and  r₁ is ß-aminoethyl or ß-acetamidoethyl and except compounds  wherein r₂ is isopropyl and r₁ is trans  ß-acetamidoethyl, are antibacterials.  their preparation and  their use in pharmaceutical compositions are described.
