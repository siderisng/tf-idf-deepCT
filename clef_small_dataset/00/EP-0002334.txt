<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns hand-cleansing compositions  which are particularly suitable for cleansing heavily oiled  hands and a method of cleansing the hands using such  compositions.  the composition contains, as a surface active  agent the condensate of at least one alcohol, phenol or acid  with an alkylene oxide, there being 9 moles of alkylene oxide  moiety per mole of the or each alcohol, phenol or acid  moiety, and a topically acceptable diluent or additive.  a  preferred composition does not contain neither a hydrocarbon  nor any other surface active agent soluble to any  appreciable extent in water, and it is also preferred that the  concentration of the condensate in the composition is at  least 5% w/v.
