<ABSTRACT>
a compact, multi-stage, co- or counter-current liquid-­ liquid extraction apparatus is described having two or mo­ re stages (6, 7, 8, 9).  each stage (6, 7, 8, 9) lies adjacent at least one other  stage and comprises a mixing chamber (16) having an agi­ tator (17) mounted thereon, upper and lower settling (25,  21) chambers, and upper and lower baffles (26, 22) bet­ ween the mixing chamber (16) and the upper and lower  settling chambers (25, 21) respectively.  the liquid media to be contacted in each stage are  supplied to the mixing chamber (16) from which dispersion  flows upwardly and downwardly into the upper (26, 22) and  lower baffles.  disengaged lighter medium flows out from the upper  settling chamber over a weir (52) to the next stage, whilst  disengaged heavier medium flows out of the lower settling  chamber of one stage to the corresponding next stage.  the disengaged heavier medium may overflow a cor­ responding weir (51) to pass on to the next stage.  alternatively the disengaged heavier phase may be ar­ ranged to flow directly from the lower settling chamber of  one stage to the mixing chamber of the next stage.  in  ration a 1 : 1 phase ratio of the dispersion in the mixing  chambers can be maintained despite a different (e. g.   10 : 1) feed rate ratio of the liquid media to the apparatus.
