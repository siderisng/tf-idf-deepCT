<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of the (±) vincadiffine and other pentacyclic pentacyclic derivatives of formula wherein R₁ represents a hydrogen or ha incurred atom, a hydroxy group or an alkyl, acyloxy or alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 atoms carbon, R₂ represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, R₃ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R₄ represents an optionally substitable alkyl group or alkoxy, Comprising from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, R₅ is a methyl group or an alkoxy group compror as many 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The method consists of a condensation of a composed of formula with an aldehyde of formula wherein X represents a good group leaving such a halogen, an arylsulfoxy, alkyl or fluoroalkylsulf oxy, this condensation being carried out in an inert solvent and the Adehyde used may possibly be in acetalized or hemiumacealized form. These compounds are useful as starting products for the synthesis of vincecamine or its derivatives and bis-indulic alkaloids.
