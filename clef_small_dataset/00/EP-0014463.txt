<DESCRIPTION>
description of an invention having for a title: "self-extinguishing polyolefin compositions having .9n impro ved resistance to heat and to thermo-oxidation". the present invention concerns self-extinguishing polymeric compositions based on oleo in homo- or copolymers such as polypropylene, polyethylene or ethylene-propylene copolymers. the prior art knows several different processes for making the polymers incombustible. the leas recent ones of such processes are in general based on the use of metal com- pounds, especially of antimony, in combination with thermally unstable halogenated compounds, suh as for instance chlorinated paraffin waxes. the combinations metal compound + halogenated compound give results that are satisfactory as far as the self-extinguishing properties they confer to the polymers are concerned, but they show serious drawbacks : corrosion phtnomenz in the equipment in which is carried out the processing of the materials, and a heavy emission of toxic smokes and ga ses in case of a fire. moreover, there are attained acceptable levels of self-extinguishing properties only by using high concentrations of such combinations. more recently, research was directed to the use of o- binations comprising an ammonium or an amine phosphate, or another phosphorus compound, and one or more nitrogen contain ing organic compounds, such as for instance: melamine, dicyan diamine or aminopiast resins. such combinations do not show the above described drawbacks, but the polymeric compositions that contain them in ge neral have poor heat and thermo-oxidation resistance. the applicant has now surprisingly found particular phosphorus and nitrogen containing anti-flame additives which, besides conferring high levels of self-extinguishing proper- ties to the polyolefins to which they are added, do not have the disadvantage of a poor resistance to heat and to thermo -oxidation. the compositions object of the present invention, for 1o0 parts of composition, contain: (t) from 5 to 30 parts of an ammonium phosphate; and (2) from 3 to 20 parts of one or more nitrogen containing compounds selected from: (a) benzyl-guanamine; (b) reac tion products of guanamines of formula; emi3.1 wherein r = phenyl, benzyl, with aldehydes; (c) reaction products of al dehydes with two nitrogen containing compounds: one having formula emi3.2 wherein r' = h, nh2, phenyl, benzyl, and the other one being a compound con taining the functions #c=o and/or =s and inserted in a cyclic structure; the molar ratio between the two nitrogen containing compounds present in (c) ran ging from 4:1 to 1:4. amongst the various usable phosphates, there are preferred the ammonium polyphosphates which fall under the general formula (nh4) n+2pno3n+1 wherein n represents an integer equal to or greater than 2; the molecular weight of the polyphospates should be preferably sufficiently high to ensure a low solubility in water. the composition of the polyphosphates of the above indi cated formula, in which n is a number sufficiently great, is practically the one corresponding to the formula of the metaphosphates (nh4po3) . an example of such polyphosphates is that known under the commercial name of "exolit 263" (produced and sold by benckiser knapsack smbh) and having the
