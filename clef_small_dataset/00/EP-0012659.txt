<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises two incli-born guide rods (1, 2) forming a slide for an embossed capsules reserve (3) each with a registration (4) and a mark or mark (5).The stems are brought to synchronously rotate around their longitudinal axes by a drive and coupling mechanism (13, 10) controlled by an optoelectronic drive (14) so as to interrupt the rotation of the stems and, hence, stacked capsules (3) when the lower capsule is presented in the position required for its introduction to the pins of the bottles (8) conveyed to the under the orientation device and themselves orientedpreviously if necessary.Application more particularly to the installation of Capsu on bottles of champagne or sparkling with mantlelets.
