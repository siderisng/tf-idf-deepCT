<ABSTRACT>
a conveyor system of a type including a tube (53,54), a  cable (30) having discs (31) rigidly attached to and equally  spaced along the cable (30) for conveying granular or  powdery materials within the tube (53,54) has an improved  drive unit (10) for causing and controlling the movement of  the cable (30) and discs (31) through the tube (53,54).  it is characterised by having a driving wheel (13) with  specially formed projections (20) to prevent the cable (30)  from jumping off and means (36, 37, 39-46) for shutting off  the power to the drive unit (10) when the cable (30) becomes  too loose.
