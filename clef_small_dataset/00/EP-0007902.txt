<ABSTRACT>
an automatic focusing system to focus automatically a  light on an objective video-disk (4) where a p-n junction ele­ ment, which is a light emitting portion (15) of a semiconductor  light source (14), has a function of a pinhole board in order to  avoid a difficult positioning of the pinhole board.  the output  of the semiconductor light source (14) is changed according to  the strength of the light reflected from the surface of the  video-disk (4).  hence, the output of the light source (14) is  phase detected in a phase detector (12) by comparison with  the output of an oscillator (11), and the output of the phase  detector (12) is supplied to an actuator (13), causing the auto­ matic focusing of a lens.  this system may be used in a video-­ disk reproducing apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification title of the invention: automatic focusing apparatus field of the invention: the present invention relates to an automatic focusing apparatus which automatically focuses focal point of ray on an object substrate. background of the invention: figure 1 is a diagram showing a structure of one embodiment of the conventional automatic focusing apparatus. in figure.l, the reference numeral (1) designates a laser source such as helium-neon laser source; (2) designates a laser ray flux; (3) designates objective lens; (4) designates an object substrate on which a focal point of the flux (2) is formed; (5) designates a beam splitter; (6) designates a condenser lens; (7) designates a pin-hole; (8) designates a ray detector; (9) designates a piezo-electric vibrator for vibrating the pinhole (7) to the optical axial direction; (10) designates a table on which an optical system is placed; (11) designates an oscillator for exciting the vibrator (9); (12) designates a phase detector which phase-detects an output of the ray detector (8) under rating an output of the oscillator (11); and (13) designates a voice coil type actuator which drives the table (10) by the output of the phase detector (12). in the apparatus, the laser ray (2) emitted from the laser source (1) is focused through the objective lens on the surface of the object substrate (4). the ray reflected from the surface of the object substrate (4) is focused again through the objective lens (3) thereby separating from the incident path by the beam splitter (5) and the ray is passed to the condenser lens (6) and focused to form ray spot and the ray is passed to the ray detector (8). the pinhole having a diameter being substantially same with the diameter of the ray spot is disposed at the focal point of the condenser lens (6) atld the pin-hole is vibrated at frequency f by the vibrator (9) excited by the oscillator (11) in optical axial direction. the output of the ray detector (8) which receives the ray passed through the pin-hole (7) is phase-detected by the phase detector (12) under rating the output of the oscillator (11) and the detection output is fed to the actuator (13) to drive the table (10) to the arrow line direction a. that is, when the focal point of the objective lens (3) is on the surface of the object substrate (4), the focal point of the condenser lens (6) is at the vibration center of the pin-hole (7) whereby signal having frequency 2f is provided from the ray detector (8) and the output of the phase detector (12) is zero. however, when the surface of the object substrate (4) is deviated from the focal point of the objective lens (3), the position of the ray spot given by the condenser lens (6) is deviated from the vibration center of the pin-hole (7) whereby the component of frequency f is formed in the output of the ray detector (8). the phase corresponds to the direction deviating the surface of
