<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering a fraction of increased purity hydrocarbons and hydrogen from the effluent current of a hydrotreatment method of hydrocarbon charges. Hydrogen gaseous increased purity is either recycled or for other uses. relatively pure hydrogen is obtained by separating the effluent current, into a separator (25) into a gas stream containing hydrogen, and a liquid phase containing hydrocarbons, and submitting the gas stream containing hydrogen to a first Absorption step in an absorption column (37), by contacting a liquid phase containing hydrocarbons, and obtained after separation in the separator (25), and then submitting the gaseous stream containing hydrogen to a hydrogen Second absorption step in the absorption column (37), by contacting a stabilized portion of the liquid phase containing the hydrocarbons and from the foot of the stabilization column (39).
