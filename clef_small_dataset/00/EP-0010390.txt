<ABSTRACT>
the present invention is directed to a method of reducing  the amount of corrosion due to sulfuric acid on metal parts at  the cold-end of a combustion system and in contact with  combustion gases derived from the combustion of sulfur-足 containing fuel, said method comprising adding to the com足 bustion gases an effective amount for the purpose of an addi足 tive comprising ethylene polyamine, optionally together with  aliphatic water-soluble alkanolamine.  the invention is also  directed to a composition for use in such a method compris足 ing ethylene polyamine and aliphatic water-soluble  alkanolamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "method and composition for reducing cold-end corrosion" as is well known to boiler operators, sulfuric containing fuels present problems not only from a pollutional point of view, but also with respect to the life and operability of metallic equipment and parts which are in contact with the flue gases containing the sulfur by-products of combustion. while the problem will be discussed herein with respect to boilers, it should be understood that both the problem and its solution could apply to other systems, such as process furnaces. upon combustion, the sulfur in the fuel is converted to sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxidv in the flue gas, sulfur trioxide and water vapor are in equilibrium with sulfuric acid. below about 450 f, essentially all of the so2 is converted to h2so4 fcr typical flue gas compositions of oil fired boilers. the resulting sulfuric acid condenses upon metal surfaces which are at temperatures below the acid dewpoint corrosion results from the attack of the condensed sul- furic acid on the metals. as can be appreciated, the greater the sulfur content-of the fuel, the more sulfuric acid will likely be produced. this is particularly the case in industria and utility operations where low grade oils are used fo:: combustion purposes. the basic area to which the present invention is directed is often referred to in the industry as the "cold-end" of a boiler. this area is generally the path in the -boiler system that the combustion gases follow after the gases have, in fact, performed their primly service of producing and/or superheating steam in larger boiler systems, the last stages through which the hot combustion gases flow include the enconomizer, the air heater, the collection equipment or electrostatic precipitator, and then the stack through which the gases are discharged. the present invention is drawn to the present inventor's discovery of ethylene polyamines optionally in combination with aliphatic, water-soluble alkanolgamines, as cold-end additives. it was determined that if this additive is fed, preferably in droplet form, and preferably as an aqueous solution, to the moving combustion gases upstream of the cold-end surfaces to be treated and preferably at a point where the gases are undergoing turbulence, it will travel along lath the gases as vapor and/or liquid droplets and deposit on the downstream cold-end surfaces it is understood that any reference to ethylene polyamine is intended to include mixtures of such compounds and any reference to alkanolamine is intended to include mixtures thereof. while a point of turbulence of the combustion gases is a preferred feed, point for the additive, a point of laminar gas flow could also be used, provided that suitable mechanical means are utilized to create a zone o!'relative turbulence for proper treatment distribution. for example, an increased number of spray nozzles may be suitably arranged within a gas flow conduit to provide adequate treatment distribution. the invention in addition to providing a method of reducing the anount of sulfuric acid corrosion of metal parts at the cold-end of a combustion
