<ABSTRACT>
a device for digging up tuberous plants, for example  beets, comprising pairs of lifting members formed by driven  shafts (6) slanting towards one another and being provided at  the lower ends with lifting bodies (7), wherein each lifting  body has a pressing face extending, viewed in an axial direction,  along a helically curved line relative to the rotary axis,  such that the lifting body will gradually penetrate into the soil  owing to the helical shape and the trailing position.  the different pairs of lifting bodies are driven with a  relative time lag to reduce the lateral reactive force on the  machine and in each pair the lifting bodies operate in synchronism  so that each time only one lifting body strikes the  tuber.  flexible elements (18) are mounted above the lifting  bodies (7).
