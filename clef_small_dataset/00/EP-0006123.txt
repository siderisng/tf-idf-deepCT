<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed an improved process for the preparation  of 10-deazaaminopterin and related compounds.   in accordance with this process, 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-pteridinediamine  hydrobromide is reacted with triphenyl-phosphine  to form a phosphonium salt which is then treated  with a base to yield the corresponding ylid (2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methylenetriphenylphosphorane.   this compound  is reacted with an aromatic aldehyde such as diethyl 4-formylbenzoyl-l-glutamate  to form an olefin which is then  reduced catalytically to the tetrahydro derivative of the  desired product.  oxidation of the tetrahydro derivative is  accomplished with hydrogen peroxide.
