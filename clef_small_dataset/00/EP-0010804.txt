<ABSTRACT>
a highly aromatized coffee product in the form of  grinder gas aroma concentrates or combinations of aroma  concentrates and substantially non-aromatized, conven足 tional coffee materials is disclosed herein.  the aroma con足 centrates are formed by adsorbing grinder gas from roasted  coffee beans onto a suitable aroma substrate, e. g.  roast  and ground coffee, roasted malt, barley, chicory, etc.  the  substrate is maintained at cryogenic temperatures prefer足 ably utilizing liquid nitrogen.  the highly aromatized coffee  products thus produced are perceived by the user to have  aroma intensities substantially greater than those of con足 ventional, substantially non-aromatized coffee materials.
