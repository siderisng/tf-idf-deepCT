<ABSTRACT>
this invention describes a four-step process for prepar­ ing 3-alkylphenols and 1,3-dihydroxybenzene comprising the  alkylation of benzene or a monoalkylbenzene followed by the  selective reaction of the 1,4-isomer of the alkylation product  in the presence of a specified type of shape selective zeolite  to obtain the 1,3-isomer in excess of equilibrium.  subsequent  oxidation and acid catalyzed rearrangement results in a sig­ nificant yield of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene or 3-alkylphenol.

<DESCRIPTION>
method for producing 3-alkylphenols and 1 ,3-dihydroxtlbenzene this invention relates to the production of aromatic alcohols, and in particular to the selective production of 3-alkylphenols and 1,3-dihydroxybenzene. the present invention provides a process for the production of hydroxybenzene compounds having substituents in the 1 and 3 positions on the benzene ring which comprises (a) alkylating an aromatic compound- with an alkylating agent to produce an isomeric mixture of dialkylbenzene compounds; (b) contacting the isomeric mixture of dialkylbenzene compounds at a temperature of from 15o0c. to 8000c. and a pressure of from 1 x n/m2 to 1 x 107 n/m2 in the presence of a shape selective zeolite catalyst characterized by a constraint index of from 1 to 12 and by silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 to selectively react the 1,4-dialkyl isomer of the dialkylbenzene compounds to obtain a reaction mixture enriched with respect to the 1,3-dialkyl isomer, (c) oxidizing the material enriched with respect to the 1,3-dialkylbenzene isomer to obtain the hydroperoxide thereof and (d) rearranging the hydroperoxide in the presence of an inorganic acid or ion exchange resin to yield a 1,3-disubstituted benzene having at least one hydroxy substituent thereon. the present invention further provides that the alkylation of the aromatic compound may be carried at a temperature of from 100 c. to 400 c. and a pressure of from 1 x 105 n/m2 to 4 x io6 n/m2 in the presence of a zeolite alkylation catalyst characterized by a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of 1 to 12. the organic compound phenol has found many important industrial and medical applications over the years. it is valuable both as an intermediate in the manufacture of other compounds and as a useful material in its own right. modern manufacturing processes are described in detail in the monograph by a. dierichs and r. kubicka, phenole und basen, vorkommen und gewinnung (akademie-verlag, berlin, 1958). 3-methylphenol is presently used in disinfectants, fumigants, photographic developers and explosives. its potential as a phenolic resin for adhesives and other industrial products is large, particularly in view of some of the unique characteristics of this particular derivative of phenol, e.g., it is approximately three times more reactive than the parent phenol and has increased toughness, moisture resistance and reduced brittleness, all of which are very desirable properties. however, a major drawback to widened industrial applications for this compound has been its relatively high cost of manufacture. japanese patent no. 8929 (1955) to maesawa and kurakano describes a process for obtaining this compound from coal tar. its preparation from toluene is disclosed by toland in u.s. patent no. 2,760,991. another process, involving oxidation of o- or p-toluic acid, is described by kaeding et al. in ind. eng. chem. 53, 805 (1961). however, separation of the 3-methyl compound (bp 2020c) from the mixed product stream, a necessary step in the heretofore practiced synthetic processes, is at best a very difficult and expensive undertaking. 1,3-dihydroxybenzene has, like phenol, found numerous
