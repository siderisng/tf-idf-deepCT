<ABSTRACT>
in a pump having a cylinder liner (11), there is a piston  with a seal (74) and rear wearband (92) therearound the piston  to seal and align the piston within the liner (11).  the elas足 tomeric seal ring (74) is in sealing and sliding contact with the  liner (11).  a gap filler (78), with minimal axial creep and con足 trolled radial creep, abuts the rear surface (82) of the seal (74)  and maintains continuous contact with the liner (11) thereby  continuously closing the extrusion gap (90) between the gap  filler (78) and the liner (11) as the liner (11) wears.  the wear足 band (92) has a plurality of angled flowpaths or grooves (96)  traversing it.  abrasive particles (98) are directed within and  through the grooves (96) in the wearband (92) while a source  of liquid is communicated into the piston, through water  channels (88) in the gap filler (78) and through the grooves  (96) in the wearband (92) to create a vortex action which  washes the liner wall (11).  the wearband (92) insures a con足 stant gap (90) between the metal piston and liner (11).  the thin  seal ring (74) improves the temperature gradient, controls the  creep, reduces the axial load and allows rear removal without  removing the piston from the liner (11).
