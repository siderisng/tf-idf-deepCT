<ABSTRACT>
a liquid level sensing apparatus includes a probe (14)  having a high positive temperature coefficient of resistivity.   the probe (14) is connected in a circuit including an opera­ tional amplifier (a₁) and a series transistor (t₁ which main­ tains the voltage across the probe (14) constant for a fixed  period following switching on of the apparatus and which  produces a voltage signal related to the current flowing in the  probe.  this voltage signal is differentiated by a differentiating  circuit (r₁₁, r₁₂, c₃) to provide a signal indicating the rate of  change of the voltage signal from which it is determined  whether or not the probe is immersed in a cooling liquid.  a  warning lamp (l) is actuated by a latching switch circuit (t₂,  t₃, t₄) when the probe is not immersed.  a second example is  described in which the probe current is maintained at a fixed  level and the rate of change of the voltage across it is moni­ tored.
