<ABSTRACT>
chromium(iii) tris-acetylacetonate, a coordinatively satu­ rated, stable chromium(iii) compound provides a dietary  chromium supplement for humans and lower animals and is a  useful hypoglycemic pharmaceutical agent for treating diab­ etes, especially when used in conjunction with insulin  therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
clifu-.t,ium ac-etylacetonate a a dittia ' suppement and pharmaceutical agent technical field the instant invention relates to chromium(iii) tris-acetylacetonate and its use as a dietary supplement and hypoglycemic pharmaceutical agent in humans and lower animals. chromium has been determined to be an essential micronutrient for the maintenance of normal glucose tolerance in animals. the chromium cation exists in oxidation states of plus ii, plus iii and plus vi. chromium(ii) is very readily oxidized to chromium(iii) on exposure to atmospheric oxygen. chromium(vi) is toxic to man and animals. the chromium tris-acetylacetonate used in this invention is a complex chromium compound in the (iii) oxidation state. chromium(iii) is safe and required in a proper dietary regimen or animals and humans. thus, as used herein, "chromium" is intended to mean the chromium cation in the iii oxidation state. the action of chromium is closely associated with that of insulin. chromium deficiency in humans has been reported as the cause of a reduced response of insulin-sensitive tissue to the hormone, manifested by impaired glucose metabolism. the use of various chromium(iii) salts for supple menting diets of mammals has been reported in the scientific literature. persons particularly in need of chromlum(iii) supplementation include diabetics (diabetes melli'us) and those suffering from a dietary chromium deficiellc ty - chromium deficiency may result in impaired glucose metabolism in one or more of the following situations: (1) dietary chromium deficiency, (2) juvenile-onset diabetes, and (3) maturity-onset diabetes. in the case of dietary chromium deficiency, if a mammal obtains less chrbium from its diet than is used our excreted from the body on a daily basis, the resulting negative chrordum balance will eventually deplete body stores of chromium to the point where many bodily functions, especially insulin-sensitive processes, are impaired. dietary supplementation with a form of chromium that is absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract and able to undergo biological interaction with insulin-sensitive systems would alleviate this situation. in juvenile-onset diabetes, -there is essentially a complete cessation of insulin production by the pancreas. lack of circulating insulin results in severe hyperglycemia. insulin therapy is required to maintain normal blood glucose levels, but treatment is difficult and often results in wide variations in blood glucose values. in addition, it is knows that elevated blood glucose results in mobilization of body stores of chromium which is then nearly quantitatively excreted in the urine. thus, it is apparent that a victim of juvenile-onset-diabetes would mobilize and excrete more chromium than a normal individual. if this chromium is not replaced via the diet or by therape^utic supplementation, the resulting chromium deficiency may induce a refractory response to exogenous insulin, exacerbating the diabetic symptoms and requiring ever increasing doses of insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. a biologically-active form of chromium, given either as a dietary supplement or as an adjunct to; or in combination with, insulin therapy, would help to prevent the development. of this situation and, in some instances, allow the amount of insulin administered to maintain normal blood glucose levels to be
