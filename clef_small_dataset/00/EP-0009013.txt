<ABSTRACT>
a pipetting and dosing device, in particular for use in  automatic clinical analysis apparatuses, for dosing and dis­ pensing accurate liquid volumes, such as samples and reag­ ents, comprises an internally cylindrical suction pipe (5) with  a conically tapering distal end (17) with a central opening  (18), a piston (7) axially movable within the suction pipe  while sealing against the inner wall of the pipe, and drive  means (8-13) for moving the piston axially over well-defined  distances in the suction pipe for, respectively, sucking up and  discharging predeterminable volumes of liquid.  the end of  the piston facing the conically tapering distal end (17) of the  suction pipe (5) is provided with a conical tip (7a) having an  apex angle somewhat larger than the apex angle of the coni­ cally tapering end of the suction pipe and this conical piston  tip (7a) or alternatively the conically tapering end (17) of the  suction pipe, is made of a resiliently deformable material.  at  the end of the discharge movement of the piston in the suc­ tion pipe the conical tip (7a) of the piston is moved into  abutment against the conically tapering end (17) of the suc­ tion pipe with such an axial force that, through elastic defor­ mation of the piston tip or alternatively the conically tapering  end of the suction pipe, the piston tip and the conically taper­ ing end of the suction pipe are brought into complete con­ formity without any residual interspace remaining therebet­ ween.
