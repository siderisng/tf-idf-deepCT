<ABSTRACT>
for the contracting states : be, ch, de, fr, gb, it, lu, nl, se 1.  r-(-)-alpha-[(methylamino)methyl]-9,10- ethanoanthracene-9(10h)-ethanol of the formula i   see diagramm : ep0014433,p10,f1   or an acid addition salt thereof.  for the designated state : at 1.  a process for the production of r-(-)-alpha-[(methylamino)methyl]-9,10-ethano anthracene-9(10h)-ethanol of the formula i or of an acid addition salt thereof,   see diagramm : ep0014433,p12,f1   which process comprises a) resolving the racemic alpha-[methylamino)-methyl]-9,10-ethanoanthracene -9(10-h)-ethanol and isolating r-(-)-alpha-[(methylamino)methyl]-9,10-ethano anthracene-9(10h)-ethanol, if desired in the form of an acid addition salt, or b) reacting a compound of the formula ii   see diagramm : ep0014433,p12,f2   with a compound of the formula iii x2 -ch3 wherein one of x1  and x2  is the amino group and the other is a reactive esterified hydroxyl group, and y1 is a free hydroxyl group and x1  together with y1  can also be an epoxy group and a is the 9,10-ethano anthracene-9(10h)-yl radical, or c) in a compound of the formula iv   see diagramm : ep0014433,p12,f3   in which at least one of z1  and z2  is a removable radical and the other may be hydrogen, or z1  and z2 together are a divalent removable radical, and a is the 9,10-ethanoanthracene-9(10h)-yl radical, removing z1 and/or z2 .  d) reducing a compound which differs from the compound of the formula i only in that, in said compound, a carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom is attached to this latter through a double bond or is substituted by a hydroxyl group or an oxo radical, optionally together with lower alkoxy, or e) adding ethylene to r-alpha-[(methylamino)methyl]-9(10h)- anthracene-ethanol, and if desired, converting the resultant r-(-)-alpha-[(methylamino)methyl]-9,10-ethanoanthracene -9(10h)-ethanol into an acid addition salt and/or liberating the base from a resultant acid addition salt.
