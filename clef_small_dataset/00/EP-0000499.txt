<ABSTRACT>
1.  a joint fitting, which can be automatically locked in at least one angular position, for two ladder portions, comprising two fitting parts (12, 13) fastened to the spar ends (10, 11) and pivotable about a common axis (21), in which case on the first fitting part (12) there is mounted a locking element (45) which is movable by means of a handle against the force of a return spring (25) from a locking position into an unlocking position and a locking position parallel to the joint axis (21), whereas in the second fitting part (13) for each selectable angular position there is provided at least one bore (30, 30') parallel to the joint axis (21) and for accommodating the locking element (45) in the locking position, and the locking element is retained by a locking mechanism initially in the locking position and subsequently, after pivoting of one fitting part relative to the other, in the unlocking position by the arc portions between the bores (30, 30') of the second fitting part (13), characterised in that each bore (30, 30') is associated with an element of a control part (64, 30; 64, 30; 80, 81) of a locking mechanism also having a retaining part (66, 67; 56, 9; 56, 79), and in each case an element (64; 64; 80) of the control part and an element (66; 56; 56) of the retaining part is formed directly at the locking element (45) which has at least one locking pin (44) and a guide stud (46) which is coincident with the joint axis (21) and which is continuously acted upon by the return spring (25) and at its free end has as an element (64; 64; 80) of the control part at least one axial projection which can be brought into engagement with the other element (30; 30; 81) of the control part associated with the bore (30, 30') in the second fitting part (13) and thus upon pivoting at least one of the fitting parts (12, 13) automatically brings the locking element (45) out of the locking position into the unlocking position.
