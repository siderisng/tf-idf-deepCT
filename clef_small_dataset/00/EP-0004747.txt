<ABSTRACT>
flame retardant oligomeric phosphate ester compositions  having the structural formula:    are prepared, wherein r is c₁-c₁₀ alkyl or haloalkyl, r¹ and  r² can be the same or different and are hydrogen, c₁-c₁₀  alkyl or haloalkyl and n is an integer from zero to about 10.  the method of preparing the compositions comprises  reacting p₂o₅ with a trialkyl or tris(haloalkyl) phosphate in the  presence of about 0. 01% to about 5% of a phosphite at a  temperature from about 0°-200°c.  a polyphosphate ester  having p-o-p bonds is formed which is then reacted with an  epoxide to yield the oligomeric phosphate ester flame  retardant compositions.  alternatively, a method of preparing similar compositions  comprises reacting p₂o₅ with a trialkyl or tris(haloalkyl)  phosphite at a temperature from about 0°c.  to about 200°c.   a mixed polyphosphate-polyphosphite ester having p-o-p  bonds is formed which is then oxidised to yield a polyphosphate  having p-o-p bonds; which is then reacted with an  epoxide to yield the oligomeric phosphate ester flame  retardant compositions.
