<ABSTRACT>
a lens element for a vehicle lamp e. g.  a direction  indicator lamp consists of a moulded transparent plastics  body (10) provided with parallel rows of projections (11) each  of which has the form of part of a body of revolution or a  cylindrical mid-region and end regions which each have the  form of part of the body of revolution of the mid-region.  in order to produce the required light output in the  direction of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle in the case  where the lens element is used in a lamp assembly having a  relatively inefficient reflector, the lens element is provided  with a plurality of ribs (12) which extend parallel to the rows  of projections and which are longer than the projections (11).   the ribs (12) preferably alternate with the rows of projections  (11) and may extend for the whole or only part of the length  of the lens element.
