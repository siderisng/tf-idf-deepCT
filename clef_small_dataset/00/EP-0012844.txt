<ABSTRACT>
a carriage assembly for holding a pair of transducers  150v in contact with the opposite sides of a flexible disk 20v  includes a pair of arms 302, 304 each carrying one of the  transducers.  a nominally flat leaf spring has the three-fold  function of (1) providing a yielding connection between the  two arms so that the two arms end therefore the transducers  may be swung apart about this connection, (2) yieldingly  holding the arms together at their places of closest  approachment at which the transducers are in contact with  the opposite faces of the disk and (3) providing a yielding  connection between a carriage support 300 and the arms as a  unit when in their closest approachment so that the arms and  therefor the transducers may pivot with respect to the carÂ­ riage with low frequency undulations of the surface of the  disk.  the transducers are each carried with respect to one of  the arms by means of a normally flat gimbal spring 330 which  flexes to hold the transducers in proper pressure contact with  the disk and serves to absorb high frequency undulations of  the disk surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
transducer carriage assembly the invention relates to a carriage assembly for holding a pair of transducers in contact with opposite sides of a thin flexible disk for data transfer. it has been previously proposed in u. s. patent 4,089,029 to provide a carriage assembly for a pair of transducers effective on a flexible magnetic disk which carriage assembly includes a gimbal spring for supporting each of the two transducers, a load arm effective on each of the transducers for moving the transducer in pressure contact with the disk and a swing arm for mounting both the gimbal spring and the load arm for each of the transducers. it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved carriage assembly for a pair of transducers effective on the opposite sides of a thin flexible disk which is simplified with respect to the prior transducer carriage assembly. accordingly, the present invention provides a transducer carriage assembly for use with a rotatable flexible disk having high and low frequency surface undulations as the disk rotates, characterised by, a pair of transducers (150v, 152v), a pair of arms (302, 304) adapted to embrace the disk (20v) on opposite sides, a respective first spring means (330) mounting each transducer opposite the other at one end of a respective arm, second spring means (306) connected to the arms (302, 304) at their other ends for biassing the said one ends of the arms together, the first and second spring means holding the transducers in effective transducing contact or near contact with opposite sides of the disk and the first spring means being effective to absorb high frequency undulations of the disk as it rotates, and means (306h) for hingedly mounting the arms with respect to a support (300) so that the arms may swing together as a unit to accommodate low frequency undulations of the disk as it rotates. an embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which fig. 1 is an isometric view of the transducer carriage assembly including a nominally flat leaf spring mounting a pair of transducer-carrying arms with respect to each other, a magnetic diskette being shown in an operative position in the assembly between these arms; fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the carriage assembly taken on line 2-2 of fig. 1; fig. 3 is a side elevational view of the carriage assembly; fig. 4 is a side elevational view of one of the two arms of the carriage assembly and taken on line 4-4 of fig. 2; fig. 5 is a plan view of the flat leaf spring, and fig. 6 is a plan view of a gimbal spring used in the assembly for carrying each of the transducers with respect to its respective arm. the transducer carriage assembly 70v now to be described may take the place of the carriage 70 disclosed in u. s. patent 4,089,029, and may be used in the data storage apparatus disclosed

<CLAIMS>
 claims   1. a transducer carriage assembly for use with a rotatable flexible disk having high and low frequency surface undulations as the disk rotates, characterised by, a pair of transducers   (15051,    152v), a pair of arms (302, 304) adapted to embrace the disk (20v) on opposite sides, a respective first spring means (330) mounting each transducer opposite the other at one end of a respective arm, second spring means (306) connected to the arms (302, 304) at their other ends for biassing the said one ends of the arms together, the first and second spring means holding the transducers in effective transducing contact or near contact with opposite sides of the disk and the first spring means being effective to absorb high frequency undulations of the disk as it rotates,  and means (306h) for hingedly mounting the arms with respect to a support (300) so that the arms may swing together as a unit to accommodate low frequency undulations of the disk as it rotates.   2. a transducer carriage assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein each first spring means includes a gimbal spring formed of a sheet of resilient material.   3. a transducer carriage assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the second spring means comprises a leaf spring having a portion that is fixed in face to face contact with one of the arms and is flexed to bear against the other of the arms so as to bias the arms towards one another.     4. a transducer carriage assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein the means for hingedly mounting the arms with respect to the support includes a further portion of the leaf spring that is substantially unflexed when the transducers are in contact with the disk.   5. a transducer carriage assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein the second spring means and hinge means together comprises a single leaf spring in flat face to face contact with a first of the arms and with the support at spaced locations for hingedly mounting the first arm on the support, the leaf spring   being:. in    flat face to face contact with the second arm at a location spaced from the location at which it is in flat face to face contact with the first arm for thereby hingedly connecting the arms together, and the leaf spring being flexed out of a flat unflexed disposition to extend from the location in contact with the second arm and to bear against the first arm at another location thereon so as to provide a force biassing the arms together.    6. a transducer carriage assembly as claimed in claim 5, wherein the single leaf spring comprises, a bifurcated leaf spring which is flat in unstressed condition having a pair of spaced outer legs, a base portion joining the spaced legs together and a central leg disposed between the outer legs, the outer legs being fixed in flat face to face contact with the support, the base portion being fixed in flat face to face contact with the first arm, the central leg being fixed in flat face to face contact with the second arm, and central leg extending from its location of fixing with the second arm to bear the first arm and being stressed thereby out of a flat unstressed condition so that it biasses the arms together.
