<ABSTRACT>
imidazoline compounds of formula (i):    wherein ar is a phenyl or mono-, di- or tri-substituted phenyl  radical in which the substituents are alkyl, alkoxy, halogen,  hydroxy, cyano, amino, trihalomethyl or nitro and in which  any two adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring may be  joined by a carbon chain containing 3 or 4 carbon atoms;   x¹ is s, nr³ or nz¹;   r¹ and r² are hydrogen or alkyl;   r³ is alkyl or aryl;   m is 0 or 1; and   z¹ and z² are a group sonr⁹ or a group    in which x²  is o, s or nr⁵;   r⁴ is alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, amino or amido;   r⁵ is alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, amino  or amido;   alkyl or alkoxy radicals containing from 1 to 4 carbon  atoms each; or an acid addition salt of the imidazoline compound.  methods of preparing the compounds are provided, as  are pesticidal formulations containing them.  the compounds are active against pests, especially arthropods  of the order acarina.
