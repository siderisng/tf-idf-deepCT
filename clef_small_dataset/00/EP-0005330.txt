<ABSTRACT>
a lighting system comprises a set of parallel connected  flasher lamps (24, 26, 30, 34) driven by an astable multivibrator  (14).  a bridge circuit detects the current flowing  in the lamps and comprises a first resistor (r7) connected  in series with the lamps, second and third resistors (r9,  r11) connected in series across the lamps, and a transistor  (t3) having its base-emitter path connected between the  junction of the first resistor and the lamps and the junction  of the second and third resistors.  the transistor (t3) control  the frequency of the multivibrator (14) so as to provide  an indication of lamp failure.  in order to compensate for  the variations of the resistance of the lamps with supply  voltage, a zener diode (zd1) and a fourth resistor (r13)  are connected in series across the second and third resistors,  and a fifth resistor (r10) is connected between  the junction of the second and third resistors and the  junction of the fourth resistor and the zener diode.

<DESCRIPTION>
description "lighting system" the present invention relates to a lighting system including a plurality of parallel connected lamps in which an indication is provided in the event of lamp failure. in one known system comprising a number of lamps connected in parallel, the current flowing in the lamps is detected by a bridge circuit comprising a first resistor connected in series with the lamps, and a second and third resistor connected in series with each other and in parallel with the first resistor and the lamps. the bridge circuit controls a pilot lamp which provides an indication when one of the lamps has failed. this system operates satisfactorily with a constant supply voltage but there is a danger of malfunction if the supply voltage fluctuates as the resistance of the lamps varies with supply voltage. for example-at a low supply voltage, there is a danger that no indication will be provided when one of the lamps fails whilst at a high supply voltage there is a danger that an indication of failure will be provided when none of the lamps has failed. in another known system, in order to compensate for the variation of the resistance of the lamps with supply voltage, the first resistor comprises a resistor in which the resistance varies with temperature. however, the provision of such a resistor is relatively costly, and also such a resistor cannot be formed as part of an integrated circuit. it is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a new or improved lighting system in which an indication is provided when one of the lamps has failed and in which the above mentioned disadvantages are overcome or reduced. according to the present invention there is provided a lighting system comprising a plurality of parallel connected lamps and a bridge circuit for detecting the current flowing in the lamps, the bridge circuit including a voltage bias means to compensate for the variation of the resistance of the lamps with the supply voltage, and the bridge circuit being used to provide an indication of lamp failure. the voltage bias means, which may be provided cheaply, reduces the danger of no indication being provided when one of the lamps fails at a low supply voltage or of an indication of failure when none of the lamps has failed at a high supply voltage. the present invention will now be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a vehicle flasher lamp system embodying the present invention; and figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a vehicle headlamp and sidelamp system embodying the present invention. referring now to figure 1, the vehicle flasher lamp system comprises negative and positive supply lines 10, 12 and a drive means in the form of an astable rmrltivibrator, indicated by a dashed line 14, connected between the lines 10, 12 and also connected to the common terminal 16 of a direction
