<ABSTRACT>
In a transport device for probe tubes (4) for attachment to temperature measuring or sample lances in the metallurgical region, a reservoir (1), a feed device (2) and a pivotable transfer device (3) of the retainer in the metallurgical vessel and made of mobile reticence (5) assigned. For the purpose of improving the operations when passing the probe tubes (4) to the retaining tank (5), wherein the probes can have tubes (4) different cross-sectional shapes or transverse cut sizes, the feed device (2) under the bottom of the reservoir (1) is angeord Net, within which the probe pipes (4) are supporting several, independent vertical tearing. Further, at the end walls (14,17) of the in front of the Council tank (1) of each vertical row, a front, the largest cross section of the respective probe tube (4) enters the end of the respective probe tube (4) and a rear opening (18) for a sliding means; The sliding means is secured to the feed device (2) in the probe axis.
