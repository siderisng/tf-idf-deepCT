<ABSTRACT>
granulates of guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, or a  water-soluble non-toxic alkylcellulose consisting of particles  having sizes within the range 100 to 1000 Âµ with less than 5%  by weight of the particles having a size below the lower limit  and having a water content of 5 to 25% by weight are useful  for oral administration to patients to lower cholesterol  and/or glucose levels in the blood.  they can be dispersed in  water to give easily drinkable mixtures.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
description "gum granulates, and tiieir preparation and use" the present invention relates to a new form of gums, their preparation and use. it is known (jenkins et al, the lancet 1975, 1116 and 1977, 779) that certain gums, e.g. guar and pectin, when administered to patients in substantial quantities have significant lowering effects on the cholesterol and glucose levels in the blood. these substances can, therefore, be used as medicaments for the control of carbohydrate metabolism and especially in the treatment of diseases like hyperglycaemia (including hyperglycaemia associated with diabetes), hyperlipoproteinaemia and obesity. however, the desired effects only occur when substantial quantities (e.g 4 to 6 g 3 to 5 times a day, or about 10-30 g per day) are taken by the patient and this presents a major practical problem because the gums are extremely hydrophilic and tend to gel very quickly in contact with water thus making it impossible to administer them in their presently known form to patients either by themselves or in admixture with, for example, foodstuffs or drinks. if gums in their commercially available form (a finely divided powder) are added to water with inadequate mixing,sticky lumps are formed which then dissolve slowly in water and are difficult and distasteful to consume. alternatively, if the mixing is adequate, a very viscous solution is very rapidly formed which is unpleasant to drink and can be unacceptable to many patients. adding powdered gum to foodstuffs is possible but is inconvenient and liable to cause an unpleasant gel to be formed, moreover, control of the amount consumed is in this case difficult. the present invention provides a new form of gums which surprisingly can be dispersed in water to give a solution of moderate viscosity which can easily be drunk. this new form of gums is a granulate of guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, or a water-soluble non-toxic alkyl-cellulose, e.g. methyl cellulose, consisting of particles having sizes within the range 100 to 1000 , preferably 125 to 500 p or better 300 to 710 , with less than 5% by weight of the particles having a size below the lower limit and having a water content of 5 to 25%, preferably 9-11%, by weight. this gum granulate mixes easily with water or any other drink like fruit juice, milk, coffee, or tea to give a low viscosity dispersion which can easily be drunk by the patient. it will be understood that while the gum must not form a highly viscous solution before it is drunk, it is necessary that it shall gel completely soon after consumption so that the desired effects may be obtained. in practical terms, this means that the granulates of the invention must not form, when mixed with water, a thick gel in under 3 minutes but should form such a gel in less than about 5 minutes , i.e. shortly after consumption. the granulates of the invention as defined above satisfy this condition. according to another aspect of the invention there is provided

<CLAIMS>
 claims    1. a granulate of a gum which is guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, or a-water-soluble non-toxic alkyl-cellulose consisting of particles of gum having sizes within the range 100 to   1000f,    with less than 5% by weight of the particles having a size below the lower limit and having a water content of 5 to 25% by weight.    2. a granulate according to claim 1 consisting of particles having sizes within the range 125 to   500    and having a water content of 9 to 11% by weight.    3. a granulate according to claim 1 consisting of particles having sizes within the range 300 to   7101l    and having a water content of 9 to 11% by weight.    4. a granulate according to any of the preceding claims in which the gum is guar gum.    5. process for the production of a gum granulate as claimed in claim 1 which comprises agglomerating a powder of the said gum having an average particle size below   1001    by treating 1 part by weight of the said powder under vigorous agitation with 0.075 to 0.4 part by weight of water and then, if necessary, drying the gum granulate obtained to a final water content of 5 to 25% by weight.     6. process according to claim 5 in which 0.1 to 0.25 part by weight of water is used per part by weight of gum.    7. process according to claim 5 or 6 in which the granulate obtained consists of particles having sizes  within the range 125 to   sooti    and having a water content of 9 to 11% by weight.    8. process according to claim 5 or 6 in which the granulate obtained consists of particles having sizes within the range 300 to   7104    and having a water content of 9 to 11% by weight.    9. process according to any of claims 5 to 8 in which the gum is guar gum.    10.a granulate as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 for use in therapy to lower the cholesterol and/or glucose level in the blood.
