<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns novel 1-benzyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine  derivatives of the general formula:-    wherein rÂ¹ is hydrogen or a (1-4c)-alkyl radical, and benzene  ring a bears one or two substituents selected from combinations  of halogeno, (1-4c)-alkyl, (1-4c)-alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro,  cyano, carboxamido, carboxyl, [(1-4c)-alkoxy]carbonyl, hydroxymethylene,  amino, (1-4c)-alkanoylamino, (1-4c)-alkylsulphonamido,  [(1-4c)-alkoxy]carbonyloxy, (1-4c)-alkanoyloxy  and optionally substituted benzoyloxy radicals,  and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts; pharmaceutical  compositions thereof; and analogy processes for their  manufacture.  the tetrahydropyridine derivatives of formula i are  preferably employed as their acid-addition salts and are  inhibitors of the aggregation of blood platelets and as such  may be of application in the treatment or prophylaxis of  thrombosis or occlusive vascular disease.  representative  compounds of formula i possessing particularly good blood  platelet aggregation inhibitory properties are 1-(3,4-dichloro-,4-chloro-3-hydroxy-,and 4-hydroxy-benzyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine,  preferably as their hydrochloride salts.
