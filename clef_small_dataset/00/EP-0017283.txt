<DESCRIPTION>
process a1zd pt#nt for breseing of water-oil bsjl2icns the invention relates to a process and plant for breaking of emulsions in which the emulsified droplets have a diameter of at least 0.02 micron, and in particular of water-in-oil and oil-inwater emulsions, which types of emulsions are referred to herein as "water-oil emulsions". in many cases the aqueous phase may be a solution of an acid, a base, a salt or an organic compound. water-oil emulsions are found widely in industry, and whether they are formed intentionally, or arise incidentally as a result of a particular operation, the aaueous phase has to be separated from the oil phase sooner or later; in other words the emulsion has to be 1'broken11. commonly this is done either by allowing the two phases to separate out by themselves due to their differing densities, or in cases where the emulsions are relatively stable, the operation may aided by the addition of chemicals, or carried out electrolytically or electrostatically. however, in the case of chemical separation, the chemicals used act by changing the proporties of the oil or additives which are used in making up the emulsion. such chemicals may often be costly, and in addition they may have harmful effects on tne oil and thus complicate or prevent its reclamation. electrolytic and electrosvatic separation processes are generally expensive to operate due to the amount of energy reqare#. breaking of emulsions in which the emulsified droplets have a small diameter (e.g. from 0.02-10 micron) is in particular cifoicult. the invention relates to a process for breaking a wa-er-oil emulsion in which the emulsified droplets have a diameter of at least 0.02 micron, which is characterized in that the water-oil emulsion is driven through a micro-pore membrane with tores having a size of at least 0.03 micron, which membrane has an array of hydrophilic zones interspersed amongst an array of oleophilic zones, and that the ratio of the diameter of the emulsified drot- lets and the size of the pores of the micro-pore membrane is at least 0.5. the two phases will then rapidly settle apart and can be decanted separately. it has been found that if the ratio of the diameter of the emulsified droplets and the size of the pores of the micropore membrane is lower than 0.5 only part of the emulsion is broken. the process in accordance with the invention can operate effectively at ambient temperatures. in case the membranes to be used can withstand higher temperatures there is no reason why the process should not be carried out at higher temperatures. typical 2 yields may be in the order of 10,000 kg/m /day at pressures as low as 2.5 bar across the membrane, although this will to some extent depend, for example upon the viscosity of the oil used in the emulsion, and the structure of the membrane. in order to achieve very effective separation it is preferred that the membrane pore size is at most 10 microns. whilst the actual choice
