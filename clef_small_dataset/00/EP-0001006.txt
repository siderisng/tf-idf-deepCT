<ABSTRACT>
the reaction of an imidazoline base of the formula:    wherein r represents an aliphatic group comprising from  6 to 22 carbon atoms and r₁ represents a substituted or  unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group comprising from 1 to 4  carbon atoms, with a carbo-alkylating agent is carried out  in two stages.  initially the ph is maintained in the range 7  to 11 and subsequently it is maintained in the range 9 to  12. 5.  these conditions encourage at least part of the imidazoline  to undergo alkylation followed by hydrolysis and  further alkylation.  the di alkylated amido-amines thus produced  are believed to be novel.  they can be represented  by the formula    where a represents a group r₂-coo⁻ wherein r₂ represents  a substituted or unsubstituted alkylene group having  from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; or a group r₁ wherein r₁ represents  a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group  having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms b and c which may be the  same or different represent a group r₂-coo⁻ or r₁ or  where a represents r₂coo⁻ one and only one of b or c  may represent a hydrogen atom with the proviso that at  least one but only one of a, b or c represents r₁.  the reaction products are surfactants which exhibit  very low skin irritancy and have a desirably low viscosity.   they find particular application in shampoo formulations.
