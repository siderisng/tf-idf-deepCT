<ABSTRACT>
in the location of an earth fault on a sheath of an  underground cable, pulses of direct current are applied to  the sheath at one location on the cable.  a search is made  for the magnetic field due to a fault current to earth flowing  in the sheath which is produced by the applied d. c.  pulses  using a portable magnetometer, with a visual indicator, and  the visual indications on the magnetometer are correlated  with the periods of application of the pulses to the sheath.   preferably, the pulses are correlated with the magnetome­ ter indications by simultaneously transmitting signals in­ dicative of, the periods of current application and using,  with the portable magnetometer, a portable receiver ar­ ranged to receive the transmitted signals so that the magne­ tometer indications by simultaneously transmitting signals  indicative of the periods of current application and using,  with the portable magnetometer, a portable receiver ar­ ranged to receive the transmitted signals so that the magne­ tometer indications can be correlated with the received  signals.
