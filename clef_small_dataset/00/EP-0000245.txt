<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for dispensing articles, particularly, but  not necessarily, packaged food articles which are warmed  within the apparatus.  the apparatus comprises a storage  zone, a dispensing zone (15) and a conveyor (25) for conveying  articles between the storage zone and the dispensing  zone (15).  articles are loaded into vacant holders (36) in a  loading zone and such loading is controlled by a detector (71)  which detects for the presence of articles in holders (36)  which are at any one time approaching the loading zone.  a  further detector (81) detects for a vacancy in the dispensing  zone (15) and, if such vacancy exists, an article is transferred  from an associated holder (36) to the dispensing zone (15).
