<ABSTRACT>
a machine for forming line pipe is disclosed wherein  small diameter roll elements (11,12,13) not exceeding five  times the thickness of the blank form a tube.  the roll ele­ ments (11-13 positioned in a pyramid roll assembly are  dynamically adjustable toward and away from each other to  provide different size line pipe, or similar tubular articles.  the  segments of the roll elements (12) are mounted on cantilever  arms (45), the leading edge of blank being deflected against  the upper curved surface of the arms (45) during the final  stages of forming.  the deflection is maintained within the  elastic recovery limit of the metal.  a rigid frame mounts the  cantilever arm (45) and other components.  the frame  includes a plurality of vertical bed plates (20) and corres­ ponding upper frame plates (30) and cross tie members (31).   a pusher mechanism pushes the sheet blank through the  pyramid roll assembly.  a multiwalled tube may be formed by  providing the required additional length to the blank and  continuation of the forming beyond 360°.  the blank is con­ fined between idler rollers (47a-47e) on the frame structures  during forming.  special roller handling assemblies are pro­ vided for loading the blank and for unloading the finished  tube from the machine.
