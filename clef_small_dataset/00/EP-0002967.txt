<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to safety catalyst systems  and their use in chemical reactions carried out in the  gas phase, wherein the safety catalyst system comprises  pelleted catalyst held loose in and throughout the holes  and folds of a folded or rolled up metal foil net which is  inside a container having holes for the inflow and outflow  of gases.  the safety catalyst system of the invention does  not allow the formation of localized hot-spots or allow free  catalyst dust to escape from the system, both of which are  known disadvantages of prior art systems.  the present invention also relates to a method of  catalysing chemical reactions in the gas phase in the presence  of such a safety catalyst system.
