<ABSTRACT>
the work table (1) and guide device are for a circular saw  which has a saw blade which can be raised through a slot (7) in  a rotatable circular plate (6) forming a part of the work table.  a  guard (8) is mounted at the end of the upper arm (12) of a  generally horizontal, u-shaped mounting or carrier bow (13),  the lower arm (14) of which is attached to the lower side of the  circular plate (6) so that the bow rotates with this plate.  the  lower arm (14) of the mounting bow has an arc-shaped porÂ­ tion (14b) connecting an outer portion (14c) of the arm with an  inner portion (14d) which is angularly offset about the axis of  rotation of the plate relative to the outer portion.  two adjacent  legs (4, 5) of the work table are positioned or shaped so as to  allow movement of the arc-shaped portion (14b) of the lower  arm outside one leg (5) and inside the other (4), thereby  allowing a large angle of rotation of the circular plate (6) and  the mounting bow (13) without said bow interfering with the  legs of the work table.

<DESCRIPTION>
"a work txim with a guard device for a motor-driven circular saw" the present invention relates to a work table with a guard device for a.motor-driven circular saw of the type in which the saw blade spindle is mounted in a mounting frame and the saw blade extends through a slot in tbe wor' table which has several legs, the mounting frame being suspended from a circular plate in which the slot is provided and which is rotatably mounted relative to the rest of the work table, a guard positioned above the slot being attached to the upper arm op a bow which is substantially u-shaped in elevation and extends outside the edge of the work table, its lower arm lying under the table and being connected to the circular plate for rotation with this plate, such a bow-shaped carrier device for a guard is prescribed by the swedish labour inspection authorities and is also imown from norwegian patent application no. 77 0660. such a bow will necessarily interfere with the legs of the work table when rotating together with the circular plate. usually it will be possible simply by designing one or more of the legs in special manners or by displacing the legs to obtain a total rotatory movement of 900, which is an absolute minimum however, it is desirable for the circular plate to be rotatable at least 450 in both directions from a cross cutting position of the saw blade, for producing a bevel cutting, and at the same time it will be advantageous if the plate can be rotated 90 in one direction from the position of the plate and the saw blade during cross cutting, so as to allow use of the saw for ripping. this means that it is highly desirable if the saw blade and the circular plate and thereby the carrier bow for the guard can be rotated an angle of at least 135 in total. the present invention aims at providing a guard of the type ref erred to initially, allowing a rotation of the saw blade and the circular plate of at least 1350 without amy substantial reduction of the stability of the work table. the worth sanle and guard device for achieving this is accordind to the invention characterized in that the lower alt or the bow in plan view comprises a substantially arc-shaped portion connecting an outer portion of the lower arm of the bow with an inner portion which is angularly offset relative to the outer portion about the axis of rotation of the plate, said arc-shaped portion lying at a distance from the axis of rotation of the plate such as to move inside one of the legs of the work table, but outside an adjacent leg. to allow the arc-shaped portion to be passed outside the said adjacent leg, this leg may be connected to the work table in a position which is closer to the axis of rotation of the plate than the

   ciaims:       1. a work table with a guard device for a motor-driven circular saw of the type in which the saw blade spindle is mounted in a mounting frame and the saw blade extends through a slot (7) in the work table which has several legs (2, 3, 4, 5), the mounting frame being suspended from a circular plate (6) in which the slot (7) is provided and which is rotatably mounted relative to the rest of the work table, the guard device comprising a guard (8) positioned above the slot (7) and attached to an upper arm (12) of a bow (13) which is substantially u-shaped in elevation and extends outside the edge of the work table (1), the bow having a lower arm (14) lying under the table and being connected to the circular plate (6) for rotation with this plate,  characterized in that the lower arm (14) of the bow (13) in plan   lew    comprises a substantially arc-shaped portion   (1':)    connecting an outer portion (14c) of the lower arm (14) of the bow with an inner portion (14d) which is angularly offset relative to the outer portion (14c), about the axis of rotation of the plate (6), said arc-shaped portion lying at a distance from the axis of rotation of the plate such as to move inside one of the legs (4) of the work table, but outside an   adjacent    leg (5).     2. a   work    table as   claimed-in    claim 1, characterized in that the said adjacent leg (5) is connected to the work table (1) in a position (16) which is closer to the axis of rotation of the plate than the distance fro this axis to the said one leg (4) or is formed with an outwardly open u-shaped portion through which the arc-shaped portion (14b) can be passed in order to allow the arc-shaped portion (14b) to be passed outside the leg (5).
