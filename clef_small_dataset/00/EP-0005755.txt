<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a container (4) for handling  small livestock, particularly poultry, in the transportation of  the poultry from a poultryhouse to a central factory at which  the poultry is processed.  the container comprises a frame (6)  of openwork construction which supports several tiers of  superposed drawers (8) mounted for movement relative  thereto between open and closed positions.  the container  comprises locking mechanism which is operative to lock all  the drawers simultaneously.  the container comprises a  lifting formation (24) which enables the container to be lifted  by (for example) a modified fork lift truck, and as a  consequence of such lifting, the locking mechanism is  automatically rendered operative.  desirably the primary  transporter (lorry or trailer) upon which the container is  placed by the fork lift truck is provided with a formation (62)  which is operative to retain the locking mechanism operative  whilst the container rests on the lorry.  the container forms  part of a novel system for the transportation of poultry from  geographically spaced buildings to a processing factory, at  which the poultry is unloaded from the containers in a  smooth and efficient manner.
