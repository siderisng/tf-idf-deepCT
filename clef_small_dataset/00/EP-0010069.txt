<ABSTRACT>
The foam glass granulate has a grain size of 0.2 to 3 mm, 10⁶ to 10⁷ gas cavities per cm³ Granu Latmasse and a bulk weight of 100 to 500 g / liter. The diameter of the largest gas cavities is substantially smaller than 0.1 mm. The gas cavities are majority or exclusively closed cells of the same magnitude. The foam glass granules can be up to 85 wt beside glass as annealing. -% BIMs, Lava and / or Tuff included. It is prepared by mixing the raw materials to a flour mixing with an organic and / or inorganic blowing agent developing in the heat gas, from the mixture of a raw granulate with a grain diameter of 0, 1 to 1, 5 mm forms and in A floating or vibration oven heated to 600 to 900 ° C for 5 to 180 seconds. In this case, the resulting foam glass granules are removed from the OFOLENT before the small gas cavities produced primarily in the blueting can assemble into major gas cavities in essential murmur.
