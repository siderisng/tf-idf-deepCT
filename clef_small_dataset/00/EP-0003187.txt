<ABSTRACT>
a credential, such as a passport or an identification card,  is provided, for example, by printing, coating or impregnation,  with a phosphorescent composition which includes at  least two phosphorescence activators having different emission  characteristics with respect to both wavelength (colour)  and lifetime (duration) so that, when the credential has been  irradiated, it exhibits an afterglow which appears to change  colour with time.  in the phosphorescent composition, the  activators are conveniently incorporated in a urea-formaldehyde  or melamine-formaldehyde resin.  the credential  may take the form of a paper core (2) carrying visible  identification information (4, 5) and surrounded by laminated-on  transparent plastics material (3) the inner surface (6)  of which has been printed with a pattern in a phosphorescent  ink the afterglow of which changes from green to blue over a  few seconds.
