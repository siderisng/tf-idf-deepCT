<ABSTRACT>
a cutter head for a suction dredger which includes a  central boss (11) mountable upon a power drive shaft (12) and  suction head or the dredger, wherein the boss (11) carries at  least one spiral-helical web (13) upon which is mounted an  array of cutter bits (19) spaced at intervals along the web (13)  and projecting therefrom so that their tips define a generally  part-ellipsoidal envelope (15), the working direction of the bits  (19) and the "hand" of the spiral-helix of the web (13) being  such that in use the cuts made by successive bits (19) on the  same web (13) are staggered relatively to one another, each  succeeding cut being nearer to the larger diameter end of the  cutter head.
