<ABSTRACT>
the specification discloses a strike off apparatus for le­ velling and compacting mounds of sand (32) extending above  the upper edges of open-top mold boxes (22) of varying  heights carried in succession along a pathway.  a pair of pivo­ tally supported rollers (38a, 38b) extend across the pathway.   a sensor (36) determines the height of a sand mound in a  mold box before it reaches the rollers.  an elevating mechan­ ism including a hydraulic cylinder (110) responsive to the sen­ sor adjusts the rollers to a height so that they level and com­ pact the sand mound as the mold box is carried thereunder.  a  control system including electrical and hydraulic circuits is  provided for automatically controlling the cyclical operation  of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
1'automatically levelling and compacting sand in mold boxes of varying heights" this invention relates generally to multi-station sand mold making apparatus for producing sand molds for foundary use, and more particularly to a strike off apparatus for automatically levelling and compacting sand in mold boxes of varying heights carried in succession along a pathway. multi-station sand mold making apparatus have been known heretofore. it is desirable that such apparatus be capable of simultaneously producing the cope (upper half) and drag (lower half) portions of a composite sand mold, the two portions being complete and assembled upon each other and ready for the molten metal pouring operation at the time they leave the apparatus. typically, a plurality of mold boxes,'èàch containing a mold pattern, are circulated around a closed pathway through a succession of stations at which different mold making operations are performed. at one station a predetermined amount of sand contained ing a binder and a catalyst is poured into an open-top mold box. the mold box is simultaneously vibrated to eliminate voids and produce some compaction of the sand. the amount of sand which is poured into the mold box is sufficient to form a mound which extends above the upper edges of the box. at a succeeding strike off station the sand is distributed, levelled, and slightly compacted before the binder hardens. this may be done by haid tamping, by using a raining apparatus, by using revolving rollers, or by some other flown technique. by distributing it is meant that the mound of sand is spread more or less evenly throughout the mold box. by levelling it is meant that a smooth, horizontal upper surface ss imparted to the sand which uslleally coincides with the upper edges of the mold box. by compacting it is meant that the space between the granules of sand is reduced. when the apparatus of the present invention is utilized at this station, voids or gaps adjacent the pattern are eliminated. this ensures a more precisely defined casting. also, the sand is compacted to a uniform density. without such a uniform density, regions of the completed, hardened composite sand iiold can prematurely crumble or fracture when the mold is filled with molten metal. this ruins the casting. when the said is compacts with the apparatus of the inventions the cope and drag prtiois produced have smooth horizontal. parting surfaces which maite when the cope and drag portions are joined to form a composite sand mold. molten metal cannot seep between the co'pe and drag portions which would a)therwiise have to be removed by machining after hardening¯ another important advantage relates to the fact that a drag portion eventually rests on its surface which has been levelled and compacted. since this surface is smooth and horizontal, the composite sand mold. is stable, i.e. it-does not tilt or rock. if. the composite sand mold tilts,,or rocks vhile molten metal is b)eing,poured into it, the metal can miss she paring hole in the mold. u.s. patent

<CLAIMS>
claims   1. a strike-off apparatus for levelling and compacting mounds of sand extending above the upper edges of open-top mold boxes of varying heights carried in succession along a pathway, the apparatus being characterised by: roller means for levelling and compacting a mound of sand in a mold box carried thereunder, the roller means comprising first and second rollers whose axes extend transversely of the direction of travel of the mold box and each of which has a length greater than the width of the box, means for pivotally supporting the rollers so that the first roller is positioned higher than the second roller and so that the rollers can swing toward and away from the mold box, means for rotating the rollers so that their lower peripheries move in a direction substantially opposite to the direction of travel of the mold box, and means for biasing the rollers toward the mold box;  sensing means for detecting an upper periphery of the mold box and the sand therein   as,    the box is carried along said pathway and for determining a height having a predetermined relation to the height of the mold box before the mold box reaches the roller means, said height being selected whereby the lower periphery of the first roller is above the upper edges of the mold box and the lower periphery of the second roller is below the upper edges of the mold box;  and means responsive to the sensing means for lowering the roller means to said height wherein the first roller levels and compacts the mound   f    sand as the mold box is carried thereunder and the second roller swings upwardly and rides along the upper edges of the mold box further to compact the sand and impart a smooth horizontal surface which coincides with said upper edges.   2. apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the means for pivotally supporting the rollers includes means for   adjust-ing uhe      height    of the rollers relative to each other.
