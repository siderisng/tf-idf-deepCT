<ABSTRACT>
an electrical termination assembly includes a termination  1 formed by a flat resilient plate split into three limbs 4,5  and 6 by slots 2.  a wire 15 is threaded between the outer  limbs 4 and 5 and the middle limb 6 and as the wire is urged  into the termination 1, edges of the limbs 4, 5 and 6 cut  through and insulating coating 17 of the wire and any oxide  film and into the conductor 16 of the wire.  the limbs 4 and 5  splay apart in the direction of a plane containing the termination  1 and the limbs 4 and 5 also splay apart from the middle  limbs 6 in a direction transverse to the plane.  this provides  the limbs with two directions of movement and this terminating  assembly is particularly useful when the conductor 16 is  made from aluminium.
