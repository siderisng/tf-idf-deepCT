<ABSTRACT>
undercut mouldings are made by injecting a crosslinkable  and foamable composition (15) based on a polymer of  ethylene into a mould (11, 12) having an undercutting  surface (14).  the composition is heated in the closed mould  to cause crosslinking and foaming.  when the mould is  opened the contents expand (16) and free themselves from  the undercutting surface.  preferred compositions include  homopolymers of ethylene and ethylene/vinyl acetate  copolymers containing 1. 8% weight of dicumyl peroxide as  crosslinking agent and 1. 7% weight of azodicarbonamide as  foaming agent.
