<ABSTRACT>
a process for producing surface treated particles by  blending particles and treating agent to produce an intimately  blended mixture.  this blended mixture is then passed  through an apparatus (10) including an impeller mill (12)  which creates conditions such that the treating agent  contacts the surface of the particles thereby producing  surface treated particles.  the invention further relates to a  process for treating calcium carbonate particles with a  treating agent such as calcium stearate or calcium rosinate,  such that calcium stearate or calcium rosinate is uniformly  coated on the surface of the calcium carbonate particles.  in  carrying out this aspect of the process, calcium carbonate is  blended with the treating agent and sufficient water to have a  5 to 30% water content in the blended mixture.  the mixture  undergoes a reaction in an impact mixing chamber (12)  forming part of the aforesaid apparatus (10) in the presence  of hot gases to produce treated calcium carbonate particles.   the particles are separated from a gaseous stream in a  cyclone and the product collected at the lower exit of the  cyclone.  use of both dry and wet reactants is disclosed.
