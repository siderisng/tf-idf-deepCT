<ABSTRACT>
a self-contained color forming pressure sensitive re足 cord paper of the single coating type which has on one  side of a support a coating layer of a mixture of color for足 mer-containing microcapsules and color developer-contain足 ing microcapsules, as well as a powdered polyolefin.  the  powdered polyolefin acts as capsule protecting agent and  prevents the smudging due to unintentional color develop足 ment caused by the rapture of the capsules.

<DESCRIPTION>
a self-contained color forming pressure sensitive record paper of the single coating type this invention relates to a novel construction of a pressure sensitive record paper. more particularly, it relates to an improvement in a self-contained color forming pressure sensitive record paper comprising a base sheet coated with single record layer of a mixture of color former-containing microcapsules and color developer-containing microcapsules. an ordinary so-called pressure sensitive paper system is composed of a so-called top sheet comprising a support material coated thereon with a layer of capsules containing a color former such as crystal violet lactone or benzoyl leuco methylene blue and an undersheet comprising a base sheet coated with a layer of an activated clay or an organic acidic substance such as acid clay, activated clay, a phenolic resin, or an aromatic carboxylic acid compound. when both sheets are placed together so that their coated surfaces may come in contact with each other and a localized pressure is applied to the top sheet by a writing means, a color image appears on the undersheet in response to the localized pressure. recently, there has been reported a pressure sensitive record paper utilizing the above-mentioned color formation mechanism to produce a type impression image without using a conventionai inked typewriter ribbon. such a record paper is composed of two layers of different composition coated one upon another on one and the same base sheet, the undercoating layer generally comprising microcapsules containing a color former dissolved in an oily liquid and the overcoating comprising dispersed color developer which develops color upon contact with the color former. when a localized marking pressure is applied to the coating layers, the capsules in the area where the marking pressure has been applied are ruptured to release the oily liquid containing the color former which produces colored image upon contact with the color developer. such a type of pressure sensitive record paper is usually called self-color developing pressure sensitive record paper or selfcontained record paper. this invention is to provide a novel construction of an advanced self-contained record paper. the conventional self-contained record paper is manufactured by a two-step process comprising a step of providing an undercoating of microcapsules and another step of providing an overcoating of color developer; consequently, the productivity including operation efficiency and product yield is greatly diminished. in addition to the increased expense for double coating of an aqueous composition, the conventional method requires increased expenses for the process control in order to avoid unintentional folding or creasing of paper which are apt to occur and to avoid unintentionally applied slight pressure during manufacture, which causes smudging due to color development. under the circumstances, the present inventors were engaged in developing methods for manufacturing in one step a self-contained color developing pressure sensitive record paper and have provided a number of novel techniques. in this invention, the present inventors propose a new construction for obtaining a single coating-type self-contained color developing pressure sensitive paper of higher quality, which is characterized by being

claims:   1. a self-contained color forming pressure sensitive record paper of the single coating type prepared by coating a base paper sheet with a uniform coating mixture of an aqueous suspension of microcapsules containing a color former and an aqueous suspension of microcapsules containing a color developer and then drying, characterized by adding a powdered polyolefin to said coating mixture.    2. a record paper according to claim 1, wherein the powdered polyolefin is added in an amount of 50 250 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of total capsule.   3. a record paper according to claim 2, wherein the amount of the powdered polyolefin is replaced at most 70% by starch particles.   4. a record paper according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the powdered polyolefin contains a major amount of polyethylene, has an average particle diameter of 10 to 30 p and is added in the form of aqueous dispersion.
