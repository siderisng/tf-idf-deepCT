<ABSTRACT>
in known semiconductor devices, carrier mobility is  limited to a considerable extent by impurity scattering.  if the  impurity concentration is reduced, so is the carrier concentration  and hence the conductivity.  in this invention a layered  structure is employed in which wide-bandgap layers alternate  with narrow-bandgap layers.  the wide-bandgap layers  are doped (22) to provide the charge carriers (26) which,  however, are transferred (30) to the narrow-bandgap layers  where they are essentially confined by band steps (Î´ec) at  the interfaces between layers.  thus the charge carriers are  segregated from the impurities which provide them and the  dilemma is avoided.  mobilities well above the theoretical  maximum can be achieved in this way.  the layered structure  can be made using molecular beam epitaxy.
