<ABSTRACT>
a separation apparatus (10) for handling a mixture with a  readily flowable liquid component (29) of slightly greater  specific gravity, for example separating a heavy viscous  grease from water.  a preferred form of apparatus comprises  an upright cylindrical tank (11) including a central cylindrical  core (14) and an outer wall between which a separation chan­ nel is defined.  the channel has a spiral ramp (12) defining its  base and is swept by an upright skimmer paddle (24) driven  for rotation about the axis of the tank (11).  two apertures are  provided in the ramp (12), the first aperture (30) having a  trap-door (32) which is normally biassed open and which is  closed by impact from a mass of the viscous or solid compo­ nents (28) as it is swept up the ramp.  the liquid component  (29) tends to precede the solid or viscous liquid component  and so has reached the trap-door (32) before it closes and  discharges through this first aperture.  the trap-door is then  closed by the solid or viscous material which then proceeds  up the ramp and is discharged to the second aperture (13).  the  skimmer paddle (24) there drops suddenly into the second  aperture (13) and is then rapidly forced upwardly by a cam  track (36) to flick the solid or viscous component (28) off the  paddle (24).  the apparatus is intended particularly for use in  separating grease having metal contamination from the  treatment water used for wet blasting of components.
