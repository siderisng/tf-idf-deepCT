<ABSTRACT>
a device for compressing dried green fodder or such like  fibre material to form bales includes a pressing screw (4)  rotatably mounted in a compression channel (2).  the dis­ charge end of the screw blade of the pressing screw (4) ter­ minates in a circle sector shaped plane (17) extending per­ pendicular to the screw axis along an angle of at least 15°  and being preceded by a blade portion (16) of gradually  increasing thickness.  this circle sector shaped plane (17)  orients the fibres in planes perpendicular to the screw axis,  so that the bales will have a high density while the coherence  between the fibres is not increased too much.  to keep the  density constant along the entire length of the bales a back  pressure means (5), movable in the compression channel (2),  is controlled so that the back pressure exerted by said back  pressure means (5) decreases when moving away from the  screw end.

<DESCRIPTION>
a device for compressing fibre material, in particular dried green fodder, into bales. the invention relates to a device for compressing fibre material, in particular dried green fodder, into bales, including a material feed debouching into a compression channel in which a compression means may be operated, said compression means having the form of a rotatable compression screw conveyor. the main part of the dried green fodders intended to be fed to ruminants is ground, compressed and formed to rodlike pieces, cubes or chips. the high density and good manageability thereof are considered to be practical advantages. it is well known that the digestive organs, particularly the rumen of the ruminant will only function properly if at least part of the fodder ration consists of particles having a fibrous structure, i.e. having relatively large length and thickness dimensions. it will be clear that the above-mentioned pieces consisting of ground particles do not have such a structure. the ground and compressed rodlike pieces, cubes or chips entail the further drawback of requiring rather much energy for the production thereof. although bales having the structure of particles may be obtained by using a known baler for compressing unground dried green fodder such bales have a relatively low density (for instance about 250 kg/m3) thus requiring much room when stored and transported. an increase of the density would however be conducive to the obtainment of a product compressed to such a degree that a ruminant will not be able to loosen. the material whereas there would also be created considerable problems in technical respect. an object of the invention is to provide a device of the type mentioned above by means of which bales having a considerably higher density (for instance about 500 kg/m3) may be compression formed while retaining the structure so that a ruminant will nvertheless be able to loosen the material from the bale in an easy manner. according to the invention the discharge end of the screw blade of the compression screw terminates in that effect into a plane perpendicular to the axis of the screw and having the shape of a sector of a circle, said plane extending ove an angle of 0 at least 15 and being preceded by a part of the blade having a gradually increasing thickness. the invention is based on the recognation that when imparting a planar surface to the end of the screw without changing the distance between the last turn of the screw and the last turn before last the fibres will be oriented in planes perpendicular to the axis of the screw and that consequently a much higher density may be imparted to the bales without increasing the coherence between the parts too much. such an orientation of the fibres in parallel planes perpendicular to the direction of compression entails moreover that the expelling of air will be better. furthermore it is important that the density will be constant over the entirelength of the bales. in case for obtaining the
