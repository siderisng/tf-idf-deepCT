<ABSTRACT>
a method of making a master replicating tool having a  predetermined aspherical profile from which negative  aspherical profiled optical elements can be made, compris­ ing machining a blank of a hard, non-deformable silieceous  material with a cutting tool in a one stage machining opera­ tion to produce substantially the predetermined profile, coat­ ing the surface so produced with a layer of nickel or nickel  based alloy, machining the nickel or nickel based alloy to  produce the predetermined profile with the cutting tool and  protecting the surface by applying a layer of an inert,  scratch-resistant material thereon.  hand figuring the blank  after machining is avoided.  the scratch-resistant layer is thin  and can be between 500 å and 5000 å thick.  this layer is  applied by vapour deposition and is preferably vacuum  deposited vitreous carbon.  the blank is machined to produce  the substantial predetermined profile to within the limits  determined by the fracture planes of the siliceous material  which are produced during the machining operation and  these fracture planes may be less than 20 µm for ceramic  materials.
