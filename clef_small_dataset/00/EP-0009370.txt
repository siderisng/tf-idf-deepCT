<ABSTRACT>
an electronic switch comprises a p-channel vertical-­ metal oxidesilicon (vmos) power device (32) having a  substantially linear input voltage/output current relation­ ship which is used to switch the supply to the tail/brake  lamp (33) of a vehicle.  three different inputs (in3, in2 and  in1) to the gate (g) of the device are provided.  due to  resistor means (34) these inputs have resistances appro­ priate to three different lamp current levels (i₃, i₂, i₁, resp.   i₄) in the lamp respectively corresponding to just insuffi­ cent to illuminate, illumination at a first light level for a tail  lamp function and illumination at a second light level for a  stop lamp function.  the lamp is normally off with current  therein at the first current level (i₃).  this reduces time  delay to illumination and current surge on illumination.   after switching to current level i₁ the filament temperature  of the bulb (33) rises and becomes more resistive.  hence  the lamp current changes from value i₁ to value i₄.  a diode  across the lamp filament reduces back emfs generated on  reducing the current.
