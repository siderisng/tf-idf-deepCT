<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a process for the  synthesis of a 1,4-diaza-2-cycloalkanone characterized in  that a diamine of the formula    wherein r₁ and r₂ are independently selected from hydrogen,  halogen, alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkyl,  haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, aminoalkyl, iminoalkyl, ether, nitrosyl,  hydroxyalkyl ethers, cyano alkyl ethers, alkenyl, alkaline  and carboalkoxy: r₃ to r₆ being independently selected  from alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl, hydroxycycloalkyl,  aminoalkyl, iminoalkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl and  alkylene, provided further that any two of the above hydrocarbon  substituents pendant from the same carbon atoms  can collectively form a cyclic or alicyclic hydrocarbon and  n is 0 to 3 is contracted in the presence of a phase transfer  catayst, with a stoichiometric excess of an ê-trihaloalkyl-alcohol  of the formula    wherein r₇ and r₈ are selected from the same group of  substituents as r₃ to r₆ x is halogen; and m is a number  from 0 to 5.
