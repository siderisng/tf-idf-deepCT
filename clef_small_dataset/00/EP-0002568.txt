<ABSTRACT>
a process for increasing mass transfer coefficients for  mass transfer between two fluid phases, one of which is a  liquid, is disclosed.  the process comprises charging the  fluids to an element (9) which has a large interfacial area and  which is permeable to the fluids and rotating the element (9)  such that the fluids are subjected to an acceleration of at  least 300 m sec-2 as they flow through the element (9).  the  element (9) is mounted conveniently in a rotatable member  (2) and the liquid may be collected in a stationary housing  (18).  the process may be employed in absorption, distillation,  extraction.  apparatus in which the process may be  effected is also disclosed.
