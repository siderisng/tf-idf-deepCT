<DESCRIPTION>
description a supporting device for use in a kneeling-like sitting posture the present invention relates to a supporting device for use in a kneeling-like sitting posture. particularly among younger people, it is popular to sit or kneel on the floor in connection with various activities, for example having a meal at a low table. this posture is quite frequently rather exhausting for the leg and ankle portions if suitable support of the leg portions or parts thereof is not provided. this is particularly the case for people not particularly used to such a posture. it is often advantageous to assume a kneeling posture in carrying out a working operation at a table in order to obtain a suitable working posture. in many applications it is preferable to have an angle of greater than 90 degrees between the back and the thighs. a condition which is normally fulfilled when assuming a kneeling posture. the prior art support devices for use in a kneeling posture are. however cumbersome to use. there are various previously known pieces of furniture of this kind. and norwegian patent no. 122.609 discloses a device where the sitting surface is in the shape of d saddle and where supporting means are provided on each side of the saddle to form rearwardly inclined faces for supporting the legs of the user. the user is forced to place the legs at a relatively great distance from each other. in additions the upper part of the body assumes a posture which makes it difficult to sit at a low surface. for example a low table. a further supporting device is known from u.s. patent no. 2.627.301 which discloses cement finishing knee boards intended to support cement finishers upon unset concrete in such a manner that their weight will be distributed over a wide area. each board has a supporting face for the knee of a respective leg. a u-shaped leg supporting member for supporting a middle portion of the leg and a rear-supporting device for engagement with the shoe of that leg of the finisher. the leg supporting means has a generally u-shaped cross-section and is provided with a strap to ensure that the board is attached to the finisher to move with the finisher in carrying out the necessary work. such a board is. however not suitable as a supporting device in a kneeling-like sitting posture. since the ankle portion of the user is not provided with any satisfactory support. further it is impossible to move about in an upright position with such a board attached. the present invention therefore has as its primary object the provision of a supporting device for use in a kneeling-like sitting posture. such that the device is easy to manufacture and use. according to the invention there is provided a supporting device for use in a kneeling-like sitting posture. characterised by means for simultaneously supporting the seat and ankle portions of the user in such a manner that at least the thigh portions of,
