<ABSTRACT>
a method of electrophotography in which an electro足 static latent image is formed on the surface of a material  layer (1) and a non-magnetic cylinder (3) is provided to  confront the surface of said material layer (1).  a perma足 nent magnet roll (2) made up of a plurality of symmetri足 cally arranged magnetic poles extends axially in said cy足 linder (3).  a magnetic brush is formed by attracting a  semiconducting or insulating magnetic toner (4) onto the  cylinder (3) with the aid of a magnetic attraction force of  the permanent magnet roll (2).  the cylinder (3) and the  permanent magnet roll (2) are moved relative to each other  to permit the magnetic brush to slide along the surface of  the material layer (1) thereby to allow the magnetic toner  (4) to adhere at predetermined positions on the surface of  said material layer (1), and a toner image is transferred  onto a transferring member and is then subjected to fixing.   the cylinder (3) and the permanent magnet roll (2) are  rotated in the same direction so that the magnetic toner  (4) is moved in the same direction as that of said material  layer (1) at a speed less than 100 mm/sec irrespective of  the speed of movement of the surface of said material layer  (1) at a development section.
