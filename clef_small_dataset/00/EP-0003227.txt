<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method of turning a parallelepipedal three-dimensional box-element, open at one side and made of reinforced concrete, having a base and four essentially vertical lateral walls, which, when using an outer shuttering a base shuttering frame and a parallelepipedal core shuttering with five shuttering walls, with the base upwards, is concreted in one casting and subsequently is tilted, by means of two l-shaped tilting tables, against whose vertical sides the three-dimensional boxe-element is made to rest without gaps, into the position in which the base of the three-dimensional box-element is directed downwards, characterized in that, after removing the outer shuttering (12) and detaching the four vertical walls of the core shuttering (11) by means of a cross-bar (16), which engages on anchoring devices (29), encased in concrete in the corners of the three-dimensional box-element, the three-dimensional box-element (10) consisting of concrete, which is still green, is raised until the top shuttering and the base shuttering frame (13, 14) of the core shuttering (11) and the three-dimensional box-element (10) become detached from each other and the three-dimensional box-element can be set down onto the first tilting table (18), on whose vertical side (19) a platform (20) is disposed parallel to the latter, which platform is moved, preferably hydraulically in the direction of its normal on the longitudinal wall of the three-dimensional box-element in order to bridge the gap, and in that a support apparatus (23, 28) bears against the inner surface of the longitudinal wall of the three-dimensional box-element facing away from the vertical side and is removed after the three-dimensional box-element is tilted.
