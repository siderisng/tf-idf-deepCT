<ABSTRACT>
a tag, particularly an ear tag for marking animals such as  cattle which have passed an official test, comprises a strip (1)  formed into two limbs (2, 3) and a hollow rivet (5), preferably  of brass, perpendicular to one of the limbs, the rivet  comprising a stock portion (6) which may be frusto-conical or  cylindrical surmounted by a narrower neck portion (7) of  reduced wall thickness surmounted by an enlarged head  portion (8) preferably in the form of a cylindrical punch having  a sharp cutting edge (14).  there is a receiver hole (17) in the  other limb of the strip to receive the rivet head and a spring  clip (19), preferably of stainless steel, secured over the  receiver hole.  as the tag is being closed, the head (8) punches  a hole in the animal's flesh, and is forced through the spring  clip (19), after which the head may be splayed outwardly.  if an  attempt is made to force the limbs apart, the spring clip  interacts with the rivet to cause it to break at the neck portion  (7).  preferably there is a shoulder (11) at the top of the stock  portion against which the limb (3) defining the receiver hole  rests.  the rivet may be formed from the material of the strip.  a  special insert for a tagging tool is alao described, this insert  having a conical boss set in the centre of a recess into which  the head of the rivet is forced.  the tag is easy to apply by  manual pressure, liable to break if an attempt is made to force  it open and easy to check visually for evidence of tampering.

<DESCRIPTION>
"ear tag for livtock, metijod of tugging therewith, a deforming insert for a taxing tool" this invention relates to tags, especially marker tags for livestock, and has particular relevance to ear tags intended to be applied to cattle to indicate that an animal has passed a particular health inspection or test. it is an object of the invention to improve the "tamper-proof" qualities of the identification tags known hitherto. an animal marked with an official identification tag may be considerably more valuable in the market place than one which is not so marked. it is therefore tempting for unscrupulous persons to obtain used ear tags, usually from slaughtered animals, to open the ear tags and then re-epp;y them to animals which have not passed the official inspection or test. there have been previous attempts to devise a satisfactory form of tamper-proof ear tag. in our british patent specification no. 1 509 555 we described an ear tag for livestock comprising a strip doubled over into two limbs and having a hollow rivet blank standing up at the free end of one of the limbs, the rivet blank comprising a stock portion surmounted by a narrower neck portion, a receiver hole through the strip near to the free end of the other of the limbs, the receiver hole being large enough to accommodate the neck portion but not the stock portion, and the neck portion having a depth such that when it has passed through the receiver hole it can be curled out and back under itself to form a rolled bead. however, this earlier invention of ours has not proved entirely successful because it was difficult in practice to form a rolled bead on every tag and if the rolled bead was only partially formed there was a risk that the tag could be opened and re-used. french patent specification no 73.22752 describes various forms of ear tag of the "button" type consisting of a plastics plate bearing identit- ication markings a rivet and a plastics locking button to receive te rivet head. in the embodiment of figure 6 the rivet head is lochfd position in the button by a spring steel washer. however, the rivet has a solid body and neck; s @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ rejoined by bonding, or r1r fitting a @@@@, the @@@@ of @@@@@@@@@@@@@ retained in the enclrp? hi.'tton @@@@@@ the rivet @@@@@@ the @@ tissue but dees not cut away any of the tissue and clogging of the j locking mechanism with tissue or hair can result. a tas hvr. plate and button joined only by a cylirdrical rivet can rotate in the hole in the ear, thus causing the fole to enlarge after a perioc of time, leading to a risk of the tag falling out. british patent specification no. 1 053 454 describes a tag formed by two tabs joined by a solid probe. the probe may have a conical shank. in the embodiment of figures 17 and 18, an aperture intended to receive the

claims      1.    a tag comprising a strip (1) formed into two limbs   (2,.3)    and a hollow rivet (5;   41;    65) standing up at the free end of one of the limbs (2), said rivet comprising a stock portion   (6;      42;    67) surmounted by a narrower neck portion (7; 44; 69) surmounted by an enlarged head portion (8; 45; 70), a receiver hole (17; 49) through the strip near to the free end of the second of said limbs (3), the receiver hole being of greater diameter than the external diameter of the head portion of the rivet, wherein a spring clip (19; 51; 72) is secured over the receiver hole (17; 49) and coaxial therewith, the clip being adapted to allow the head portion   (8;    45;  70) of the rivet to be forceably passed through it to close the tag and being then adapted to interact with the rivet to cause it to break at the neck portion (7; 44; 69) if an attempt is made to force the   lirribs    apart, the rivet being of reduced wall thickness at the neck portion as compared to the stock portion or head portion.   2. a tag according to claim 1 wherein the receiver hole (17) is of marginally greater diameter than the external diameter of the head portion   (8;    70) but is of smaller diameter than the external diameter of the stock portion (6; 67) of the rivet and the-transition from the stock portion (6; 67-) to the neck portion (7; 69), is formed by-a shoulder (11; 68) which provides a mating surface for a portion (18) of the second limb (3) defining the receiver hole (17).   3. a tag according to either of the preceding claims wherein the head portion (8; 70) is deformable radially outwardly after it has been passed through the spring clip   (19;    72).   4. a tag according to any of the preceding claims wherein the head portion (8; 70) is externally cylindrical.   5. a tag according to claim 4 wherein the head portion (8; 70) is sharpened at its free edge and is a close fit within the receiver hole (17) so that it acts as a punch.     6. a tag according to any of the preceding claims wherein the rivet (5; 41; 65) is brass while the spring clip (19;   51;    72) is of stainless steel.   7. a tag according to any of the preceding claims wherein the shank portion (6; 72) has a frusto-conical external surface tapering upwardly towards the neck.   8. a tag according to any of the preceding claims wherein the rivet (65) is integral with and formed from the material of the strip (1).    9. a method of tagging an animal comprising inserting a part of the animal's flesh between the head portion of the rivet   (5;    65) and the second limb (3) of a tag according to claim 3, closing the tag by manual pressure upon a tagging tool so that the head portion cuts through the flesh and is forced through the spring clip   (19;    72), and deforming the head portion (8; 70) radially outwardly to form a splayed flange.   10. a deforming insert for a tagging tool for applying tags according to claim 3, wherein the insert (30) has a cylindrical recess (32) to receive the head portion (8) of the rivet (5), a wall (33) surrounding the recess (32) being adapted to engage an annular outer portion of the clip (19), and a conical boss (34) located coaxially in said recess (32) to deform the head portion (8) of the rivet radially outwardly.
