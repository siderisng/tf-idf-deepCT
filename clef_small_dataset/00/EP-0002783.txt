<ABSTRACT>
an electrolysis process is disclosed in which an electrolyte, either anolyte or catholyte, is transferred serially from one cell, in a bank of a plurality of cells, to the corresponding electrolyte compartment of a succeeding cell in the bank.  the transfer is accomplished by means of a gas-lift in which gas, present in the compartment of the electrolyte to be transferred, rises through a confined space.  the space is dimensioned such that the gas serves to lift the electrolyte upward to a point where the gas and liquid separate and the liquid electrolyte is allowed to fall freely to a collection point from which it is introduced into the corresponding electrolyte compartment of a succeeding cell.
