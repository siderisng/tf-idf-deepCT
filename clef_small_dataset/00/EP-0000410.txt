<ABSTRACT>
rotary printing cylinders usually have the form of a  steel cylinder, the surface of which is covered with a copper  layer into which in transferring elements are engraved.   such printing cylinders are heavy, expensive to manufacture  and can only be used for one printing pattern.  according to this invention it is suggested to avoid the  above drawbacks by using a separate printing sleeve (i)  with a cylindrical outer printing surface and a conical inner  surface, which sleeve can be firmly applied onto a basic  cylinder (7) the outer surface of which has a corresponding  conical shape.  to make the sleeve changing easier the  basic cylinder is provided with ducts (10) emerging into  the conical surface, through which ducts compressed air  can be discharged into the space between the sleeve and  the cylinder when the sleeve is mounted or dismounted.
