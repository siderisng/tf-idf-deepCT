<ABSTRACT>
a mode selection circuit is disclosed which is suitable for  configuring a data processor at the time at which the data  processor is initialized with a reset signal.  mode selection  latches (90, 92, 96) are coupled to terminals (6) normally used  as an input/output port for the data processor and the  latches are clocked with a signal (88) generated by a lever  detector circuit (108) which senses the reset signal (98).  the  mode selection latches are programmed by applying  appropriate logic levels to the terminals of the input/output  port at the time at which the data processor is being reset.   the circuitry is adapted for allowing the connection of a  diode (100) from a terminal (6) of the input/output port to the  reset terminal (98) of the data processor in order to program  a low logic level into the corresponding mode detection  latch.

<DESCRIPTION>
tr irattle programmable mode select by reset this invention relates generally to a data processor and more particularly to circuitry for selecting the mode of operation for a data processor. applications for integrated circuit data processors are rapidly increasing. various applications for these data processor devices may require varying configurations of the input-output circuitry associated with a data processor device. in order for a single data processor device to be employed within these varying applications, the input-output circuitry of a data processor must be flexible such that it can be programmed to satisfy the needs of any particular applications. one prior art approach for providing various configurations of the input-output circuitry for a data processor is to provide a plurality of mask options which vary the integrated circuit metal interconnections during processing such that a particular metal mask is used to provide an integrated circuit data processor of the desired configuration. however, this approach results in higher costs for processing, testing, and inventory control since each mask option results in a unique integrated circuit. another prior art approach is to make the configuration of the processor device software programmable such that instructions are stored in a program memory which must be executed by the processor to achieve the desired configuration of the input-output circuitry for the data processor device. however, this approach increases the number of storage locations required for the program memory. a third prior art approach is to hardware-program the mode of operation by providing separate program selection inputs to the data processor for configuring the inputoutput circuit. this approach is also costly in that additional package pins are required for the integrated circuit device in order to determine the mode of operation. it is an object of the present invention to provide circuitry for selecting the mode of operation for a data processor while avoiding the need for mask options, additional software, or extra integrated circuit package pins. it is a further object of the present invention to provide circuitry which selects the mode of operation for a data processor whenever the data processor is powered-up or restarted. according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a data processor of the type which includes storage elements for storing digital information, the data processor including reset circuitry (106) for receiving a reset signal, (98) the reset circuitry being responsive to the reset signal for causing the storage elements to store predetermined digital information and for initiating execution of instructions stored in a memory, the data processor also including input-output circuitry (2) having at least one terminal (6) for transmitting at least one digital signal, the at least one digital signal having first and second logic states characterized by: : mode selection circuitry (4,108) coupled to the at least one terminal (6) and being responsive to the reset signal for storing the logic state of the at least one digital signal immediately prior t√≥ the initiation of execution of the instructions stored in the memory. according
