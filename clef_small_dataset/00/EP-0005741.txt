<ABSTRACT>
a process for providing ion-implanted regions (6) in a  semi-conductive substrate (2) such as silicon beneath an  existing layer (3) such as silicon dioxide and being self-aligned  to subsequently fabricated regions of said layer  which includes providing a resist masking pattern (4) above  the existing layer (3) wherein the resist masking pattern has  vertical sidewalls (i. e. , perpendicular to the upper surface of  the substrate) or is undercut; ion-implanting impurities such  as boron ions through the layer (3) but not through the resist  (4) and portions of the layer beneath the resist; and  depositing a layer of lift-off material (7) such as aluminum on  the existing layer and on the resist.  the implantation step  must be performed after providing the undercut resist  masking pattern, but before depositing the layer of lift-off  material (7) in order to achieve the desired self-alignment  feature.  because of the resist profile (i. e. , vertical walls or  being undercut) no lift-off material is deposited on the  sidewalls of the resist and a gap (8) is formed between the  resist (4) and that portion of the lift-off material (7) which is  above the existing layer.  the resist pattern is removed along  with the portion of the lift-off material layer deposited  thereon.  the nowexposed portion of the existing layer  located beneath the previous resist pattern is then removed.   finally, the remaining regions of lift-off material are removed  from above the regions of the existing layer.
