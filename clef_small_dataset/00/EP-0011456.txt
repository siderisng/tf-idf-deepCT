<ABSTRACT>
the novel organotin compounds contain:   (a) at least one tin atom linked to one or two groups (g)  chosen from hydrocarbyl groups or substituted hydrocarbyl  groups, the group (g) or each group (g) being bonded to sn  through c;   (b) at least one mercaptoalkanol residue bonded to sn  through the s atom of the said residue, the o atom of the  said residue being bonded to one of:   h, optionally substituted hydrocarbyl, the residue obtained  by removal of the oh portion of one -cooh group of a  polycarboxylic or hydroxypolycarboxylic acid, al, b, p, si or  ti or the residue of a compound of al, b, p, si or ti that  contains at least one group capable of displacing the h atom  of an oh group bonded to a c atom, with the proviso that the  moiety of any polycarboxylic acid so used is bonded to at  least two mercaptoalkanol residues through an o atom of the  said residues and a -co- group of said polycarboxylic acid  moiety;   (c) up to 52% by weight of tin, and   (d) up to 63% by weight of sulphur.  the compounds are useful stabilizers for resins or  polymers, especially halogen-containing resins or polymers  such as p. v. c.  which can be heat stabilized therewith.
