<ABSTRACT>
the problem exists of finding a simple, economic and  straightforward process for the production of indene monomer.   this problem is solved by making indene monomer and  substituted indene monomers by a dehydrogenation process  in which an indene precursor more saturated than indene is  contacted with an oxygen donor with a phosphate catalyst.   an oxygen donor is o₂.  the process is carried out a temperature  above 100°c.  the phosphate catalyst is represented by the formula  mapxoy in which m is one or more elements selected from  mg, sr, ca, ba, la, ce, other rare earths, cr, mn, fe, co, ni,  cu, zn, sn, pb, bi, te, b, al, rh, sb, as, ge, u, th and ru.  in a representative example a mixture of indane, approximately  five parts of air and three parts of nitrogen for each  part of indane vapour are fed to a reactor containing a phosphate  catalyst and maintained at a temperature of 550°c.
