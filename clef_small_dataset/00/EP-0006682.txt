<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for tool-assisted stretch-­ forming of deep-drawn hollow articles (e.  g.  cup 1) from  heat-softened thermoplastics sheet (30) in which at least  one cold tip (34) (cold enough to chill sheet (30) at the  point of contact to prevent sheet (30) sliding over tip (34)  to ensure positive control of stretching) initially stretches  sheet (30) optionally into a cavity mould (32) and subse­ quently the initially stretched sheet is dilated transversely  of the initial stretching by fluid pressure or by an out­ wards separation of an array of twelve or more tips (34.  dilation preferably occurs simultaneously with a con­ tinuation of the initial stretching.  preferably, the twelve  or more tips (34) are located to the end of edges of  blades (35) which also engage and chill sheet (30) during  stretching creating more positive control of stretching.   increased positive control of stretching creates more uni­ form wall thickness leading to cups of increased strength  and also a less temperature-sensitive process.  use of a  multiplicity of opposed tools eliminates the need for  clamping rings and increases the number of cups which  can be formed from a sheet of given area.  also articles  characterised by blobs and ribs of less stretched mate­ rial.
