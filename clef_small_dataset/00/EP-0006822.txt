<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to means, methods and assemblies of reagents for the assay of serum cholesterol.The method of measuring serum choles com takes a separation of the fractions of lipoproteins according to their density, then the determination of the lesterol choct of at least one of these fractions, and is characterized in that the separation is carried out., from a serum sample, by selective precipitation of the LDL and VLDL fraction (containing apoprotein b) by means of a lectin capable of forming complexes with these lipoproteins.The method according to the invention allows a diffeched dosage reinforced with cholesterol according to the fractions of lipoproteins to which it is fixed.
