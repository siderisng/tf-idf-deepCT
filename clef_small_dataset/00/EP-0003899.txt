<ABSTRACT>
a system for interlocking the rotation of master and  slave shafts is particularly suitable for use in film editing  tables.  the or each slave shaft (33) is controlled by, firstly, a  velocity servo loop which compels the slave shaft to rotate in  precise speed synchronism with a remote or line master  shaft (33a).  this primary feedback loop compromises encoders  (36, 35) generating trains of pulses having a characteristic  representative of rotational speed, and bipolar frequency-to-voltage  converters (42, 43) deriving from these pulse  trains analogue voltages which are applied to a differential  amplifier (32) to produce an error signal to be driven to zero  for control of the slave shaft speed.  additionally, a secondary  feedback loop includes a digital-to-analogue converter (41)  for deriving a third analogue voltage proportional to the digitally  measured difference between the characteristics of the  first and second trains of digital pulses.  this third analogue  voltage is combined with the first or second analogue voltage  in a mixer (37) to form a composite input to the differential  amplifier and, being derived through a secondary feedback  loop parallel to the primary loop, maintains the shaft  feed in precisely interlocked synchronism.
