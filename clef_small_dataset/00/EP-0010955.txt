<ABSTRACT>
a process for the treatment of glass yarn in which the  yarn is impregnated with a low viscosity solution of a  thermosetting binder in an organic solvent, the viscosity  of said solution being not greater than 50 centipoise  (=0. 05 pascal seconds) at 25°c; solvent is then evaporat­ ed from the impregnated yarn; the yarn is further  impregnated with a high viscosity solution of a thermo­ setting binder in an organic solvent; and solvent is again  evaporated from the impregnated yarn.  the process improves the properties of the glass  yarn when used in the manufacture of glass reinforced  composites.
