<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector in combination with a multi-wire  electrical cable and a method of producing such a combination.  the connector comprises first (115) and second (136)  insulating housings each provided with slotted plate contacts  (105 and 160).  first wires (102) of a cable (100) are connected  to the contacts (105) of the first housing (115), the housings  (115 and 136) are mated and second wires (101) of the cable  (100) are connected to the contact (160) of the second housing  (136).  for selectively grounding signal wires (102) of a flat  multi-wire cable (100), the contacts (160) of the second housing  (136) are formed with a common bus-bar (142) from which  depend removable contact arms (143) for engaging the contacts  (105) of the first housing (115).  all the contacts (105 and  160) are spaced so that the cable wires (101 and 102) need not  be spread.
