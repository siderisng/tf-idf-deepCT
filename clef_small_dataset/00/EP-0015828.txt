<ABSTRACT>
the invention deals with novel polyarylates and a pro­ cess for their preparation.  polyarylates derived from a mixture of iso and tereph­ thalic acids and 4,4′-biphenol and bisphenol a were found  to afford melt stable polyesters having good solvent and  stress crack resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
stress-crack resistant polyarylates and progress for the freparation background of the iwention this invention pertains to stress-crack resistant polyarylates and more particularly to bisphenol a iso/terephthalates modified with 4,4' -biphenol. polyarylates or polyesters derived from bishenol a and iso/terephthalic acids are tough materials having a continuous use temperature of about 1400c. however, as with many other amorphous thermoplastics, they possess poor solvent and stress-crack resistance. such polyesters may be represented as having repeating units as shown below emi1.1 on the other hand, h. g. weyland et al. reported in euro. poly j. 6, 1339 (1970) that a 4,4' -biphenol iso/terephthalate prepared by interfacial polymerization was both insoluble and infusible. isophthalates of 4,4' -biphenol modified with hydroquinone are described in u.s. 3,036,991 and 3,160,602. these copolymers contain at least 40 mol percent of hydroquinone isophthalate and were prepared via the reaction of the di-functional phenols with isophthaloyl chloride in solvents boiling above 300 c. these polyesters are highly crystalline having melting points ranging from 350 to 4000c. slowly cooled moldings are crystalline and translucent while rapidly cooled or quenched moldings are amorphous and transparent. no mechanical data are revealed in these references. linear co-polyesters have been prepared from terephthalic or isophthalic acid, a bizphenol and hydroquinone containing 5 to 35 mol percent of the hydroquinone. bisphenol a polyesters of isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid or iso/terephthalic acid mixtures lack solvent and stress-crack resistance. 4,4' -biphenol polyesters of iso/terephthalic acid mixtures are solvent resistant but are not melt processable. u.s. 3,939,117 discloses a method for producing a-polyarylene ester at temperatures of o to 1000c in an organic solvent for the polyarylene ester in the presence of solid ca (oh)2 and a polymerization catalyst. one or more divalent phenols and aromatic dicarboxylic chlorides are used butthere is no appreciation of the use of a particular ratio of particular divalent phenols to afford polyarylates having enhanced solvent and stress crack resistance. swtary of the invention it has now been unexpectedly found that polyarylate compositions that contain isophthalic acid moieties or a mixture of isophthalic and terephthalic acid moieties, and about 20 to about 80 mol percent of 4,4' -biphenol moieties and about 80 to about 20 mol percent of bisphenol a moieties based on total diphenol content of the polymer are solvent resistant, stress crack resistant and melt processable. the diacids and dlhydric phenols are in essentially stoichiometric quantities. the preferred polyarylate compositions consist of a dicarboxylic acid structure consisting essentially of isophthalic/terephthalic acid mol ratios of about 50/50 to about 100/0 together with a dihydric phenol mixture consisting es sentially of 4,4' -biphenol/bisphenol a mol ratios of about 20/80 to about 50/50. the more preferred composition consist of an isophthalic/terephthalic acid mol ratio of about 50/50 to about 75/25 and a dihydric phenol mixture consisting eo- sentially of a 4,4' -biphenol/bisphenol a mol ratio of about 30/70 to about 55/45. the resultant copolyarylates have both enhanced solvent resistance and stress crack resistance and they possess excellent thermal properties, processability, toughness and flammability characteristics. this
