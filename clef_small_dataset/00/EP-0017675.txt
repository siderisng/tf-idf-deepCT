<ABSTRACT>
an expandable coiler mandrel has a core (1), radially  movable segments (2) around the core and hydraulic pis­ tons (6) to move the segments (2) outwardly.  to provide a mandrel in which all movements are  actuated hydraulically, and in which tilting of the segments  during expansion is avoided, the segments (2) are secured  to the pistons (6) which are annular and mounted around  pins (4) having heads to limit the movement of the seg­ ments.  the pistons (6) can be urged in either direction by  hydraulic fluid, to expand and retract the mandrel.  fluid for  expansion is supplied by pressure cylinders.  the pistons  (6) associated with a single segment (2) are actuated by  at least two of the pressure cylinders.

<DESCRIPTION>
"expandable coiler mandrel" this invention relates to an expandable coiler mandrel, having a core, a plurality of radially expandable segments mounted around the core and, for each segment, a plurality of hydraulic pistonand-cylinder units by which the segments are movable radially, these being connected to the hydraulic units within the core. expendable coiler mandrels are frequently used in rolling mills for metal strip and sheet, recoiler equipment and the like. a strip is coiled tightly onto the expanded segments of the mandrel and can be removed later from the mandrel by moving the segments inwardly. a construction for a mandrel as described above is shown in usa patent 2 321 146; other examples are french patent specifications 1c74 746 and 2 310 950. a variation shown in french patent specification 1 367 531 has wedges which push the segments outwardly, the wedges themselves being moved by a piston-and-cylinder unit. in all of these, the piston units act to move the segments outwardly against the force of inwardly acting return springs, which cause retraction of the segments when the hydraulic pressure is released. the segments are not fixed to the pistons. this means that the fluid has to overcome the force of the springs in order to expand the pistons. additionally, this mixture of hydraulic and mechanical operation is a complication and is liable to lead to vibrations or oscillations. another problem unsolved by the prior art is that of tilting of the segments, if for instance one piston jams or is faulty. in the above specifications, a common hydraulic feed to all pistons is shown. tbe present invention therefore has as its object the provision of a coiler mandrel which overcomes the problems of the prior art and in particular a mandrel in which mechanical actuation is avoided, in which the hydraulic drive does not have to overcome the force of counter-acting springs, which is simple in construction and in which uniform movement of the segments without tilting is promoted. the invention as claimed is intended to achieve this object. the segments are secured to the pistons, which are annular in shape and are guided by pins fixed in the core. these pins also limit the outward movement of the segments. the segments are both expanded and contracted hydraulically, so that return springs are avoided. because the transmission of force now takes place only by means of the pressure fluid, it is possible to have a construction which is far simpler from a mechanical point of view, which in addition requires no separate greasing. the relatively moving parts of the mandrel are lubricated by the pressure fluid itself, while only comparatively slight forces are transmitted between surfaces of moving parts touching each other. the new construction requires minimum maintenance, and can be constructed symmetrically in a simple way. the latter is definitely an asset when achieving rotational balance of the coiler mandrel. it is also beneficial, for trouble-free operation, that the segments are moved outwardly by fluid supplied by the
