<ABSTRACT>
a method is disclosed which is particularly concerned  with loran-c navigation systems.  a typical loran-c pulse is a  tearshaped envelope of a plurality of successive radiofre足 quency cycles.  the number of cycles of the conventional  loran-c pulse is considerably reduced.  apparatus is disclosed  for transmitting these pulses and for generating the desired  antenna current waveform.  a waveform is transmitted includ足 ing a unique single navigation cycle that enables an unam足 biguous cycle selection.  a schematic circuit diagram of a preferred embodiment  of the transmitter power stage is shown in fig.  5.  the pulse is  generated by storing energy in a capacitor (c1), connected  hrough scr1-controlled inductance (l1) with a dc power  source.  further, the energy is transferred into the antenna  circuit (la, ca, ra) by scr2-controlled inductor (l2) and  saturable transformer (t).  the discontinuities at the beginning and end of the radi足 ated pulse are smoothed by capacitance (c2), switch (s) and  resistance (rs).
