<ABSTRACT>
a starch which has been reacted with a dicarboxylic acid  anhydride such as octenyl succinic anhydride is applied to a  formed paper web from the size press.  the starch combines  with a multivalent metal ion e. g.  (aluminium) already present  in the paper web to become hydrophobic, and thereby impart  a high level of water resistance concentrated at the surface of  the paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of sizing paper. this invention relates to a method of sizing paper. conventional high-grade, water-resistant papers are made by adding rosin (a natural product from pine trees) at the wet-end of the papermaking process. the rosin is barely water-dispersible, and in the presence of alum, it precipitates in the fibre web as the paper sheet is being formed. variations in the composition of the paper-making furnish can have an adverse effect on the amount of rosin which precipitates on the papermaking wire. the usual commercial practice to compens#ate for such variations is to add an excess amount of rosin to the furnish to ensure sufficient pickup to make a paper having the desired level of water-resistance. there are increasing numbers of paper mills which use recycled paper as part of the raw material in the wet-end furnish of the papermaking process. as material economy measures are required, and conditions of ph, surface charge and pulp constituents in the papermaking machine are changed, the materials which can be used to impart water-resistance to the paper must meet new requirements without sacrificing paper quality. in some earlier attempts to make a water-resistant paper by adding rosin/alum compounds at the size press, too much rosin/ alum was employed and the excess tended to coagulate and gum up the size press, causing the resulting paper to be "spotty". an improved method for applying rosin/alum at the size press is disclosed in united states patent application serial number 909,854 filed may 26 978. the method described in that application, however, employs rosin and therefore, is limited in its possible uses by the availability of rosin and its compatibility with the other components of the paper. the method also requires that alum be added at the size press along with the rosin. this is in addition to the alum normally included in the furnish at the wetend of the papermaking machine. to applicants' knowledge, there has not yet been a successful commercial method of obtaining water-resistant paper by means of sizing with a starch derivative at the size press in apapermaking process. united states patent 3,279,975 describes a method of surface sizing using the reaction product of an unsaturated acid and petroleum resin. various other materials are disclosed in the literature for use as sizing agents for the surface treatment of paper. such materials include emulsions of the reaction product of an unsaturated dibasic acid or anhydride of the acid with, for example, a maleated petroleum resin, alkyl ketene dimers, alkalisoluble styrene copolymers, chromium complexes of fluoro- carbon chemicals, and others. such materials have not attained widespread use because of costs, or control problems, such as the "gum up phenomena, or drying problems. united states patents, 2,613,206; 2,461,139 and 3,091,567 disclose certain hydrophobic starch acd- esters and various uses for these starch derivatives. a method of making these starch acid-esters and their combination with multivalent metal ions such as aluminium is disclosed in united states patent 2,613,206, and the hydrophobic character of the starch is
