<ABSTRACT>
the invention is a pressure responsive shut-off valve  (11) including a valve housing (12) that defines a fluid inlet  (13) and a fluid outlet (14) separated by a valve seat (16).   a valve closure (17) accommodated by the valve seat (16)  moves between open and closed positions to control fluid  flow between the inlet (13) and outlet (14).  controlling the  valve (11) is a valve operator (25) including a pressure  responsive piston (29) that moves between a set position  in which the valve closure (17) is separated from the valve  seat (16) and a release position in which the closure (17)  is seated on the seat (16) to prevent fluid flow between the  inlet (13) and outlet.  retaining the piston (29) is a cylinder  body (26) that defines an activating volume (27) com­ municating with the inlet (13) and establishing on one face  piston (29) a fluid pressure forcing the piston (29)  towards its release position, and a reference volume (28)  communicating with the inlet (13) and establishing on the  opposite face of the piston (29) a reference volume (28).   an internal seal (39) isolates the inlet (13) from the ref­ erence volume (28) with the piston (29) in its set position  while allowing fluid communication therebetween with the  piston (29) in its release position.  maintaining the piston  (29) in the set position is a latching mechanism (35) that,  after activation of the piston (29) to its release position by  excessive pressure, can be restored by a manual reset (45,  46).
