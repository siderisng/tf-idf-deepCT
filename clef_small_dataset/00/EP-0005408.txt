<ABSTRACT>
it has now been found that small size particles may be  extracted from a proteinaceous liquid at a low flow rate in flow-centrifuge  operation by precooling the liquid before it enters the  centrifuge and by employing a multistep gradient.

<DESCRIPTION>
recovery of small particles by flow centrifugation detailed description in the case of extracting hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) from a biological fluid such as, for example, plasma, the problem of gradient lock is magnified for several reasons: 1. it is necessary to flow a large amount of plasma through the rotor at one time. 2. the hb5ag particle is extremely small, about 1/5 the size of an average virus particle, and it is necessary to employ a very low flow rate which rate is selected in order to obtain efficient extraction of the hb ag, i.e. an ex s traction efficiency of about 70% or above. at high flow rates the ex traction efficiency declines drastically. in the xe flow centrifuge, a low flow rate is from about 1.5 to about 2.5 liters per hour. 3. the use of a very low flow increases the residence time which is required for efficient extraction. it also results in an imbalance between the density of the inlet material and outlet material as at low flow rates the outflow material contains less low density inlet material and so the density gradient component of the outflow material is not diluted by low density inlet material as much as it would be at a high flow rate. 4. the forward diffusion takes place at a rate dependent only on the centrifugal force and the physical characteristics of the gradient material itself. thus, at a low flow rate, less outflow material will be present to dilute the dense gradient material moving forward than at a high flow rate. 5. plasma contains signficant amounts of proteinaceous matter which is liable to coagulate due to heat generated in the rotating seal of the centrifuge especially at low flow rates. therefore, the plasma must be cooled just prior to entering the centrifuge. 6. coarse filtration of the plasma must be done shortly prior to feeding the plasma into the centrifuge because debris will reform after filtration has been carried out and clog the narrow channels in the flow centrifuge. it has been found, however, according to the present invention that small size particles, i.e., particles having a size up to about 50 nm may be extracted from a proteinaceous liquid at a low flow rate in flow-centrifuge operation by precooling the liquid before it enters the centrifuge and by employing a multi-step gradient. by a proteinaceous liquid is meant a liquid containing proteins such as, for example, plasma. by a low flow rate is meant one which provides efficient extraction of the small size particles from the proteinaceous liquid, i.e., an extraction efficiency of about 70% or above. at high flow rates the extraction efficiency declines drastically. in the k6 flow centrifuge, a low flow rate is from about 1.5 to about 2.5 liters/hour. by a multi-step gradient is meant one containing a sufficient number of steps so that the density differential between any two adjacent steps is sufficiently small to reduce forward diffusion of the gradient sufficiently

<CLAIMS>
what is claimed is:    1. a process for the direct extraction of small size particles from a proteinaceous liquid comprising removing flocculent material, pre-cooling the proteinaceous liquid, passing the proteinaceous liquid at a low flow rate effective to provide efficient extraction of the small size particles in continuous flow through a flow centrifuge which has been filled with a multi-step gradient wherein the density differential between adjacent steps is sufficiently small to prevent gradient lock.    2. a process according to claim 1 wherein the proteinaceous liquid is plasma.    3. a process according to claim 1 wherein the flow rate is one which permits coaggulation of a protein in the proteinaceous liquid in the absence of pre-cooling.    4. a process according to claim 1 wherein the mutli-step gradient comprises sucrose.    5. a process according to claim 1 wherein the multi-step gradient comprises about 10% sucrose, about 25% sucrose, about 40% sucrose and about 60% sucrose.
