<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of partially esterified and partially versed reaction products of natural resin acids, formaldehyde and compounds of divalent metals, characterized by the following process stages: a) reacting the natural resin acids under elevated pressure at 100 to 200 ° C with 7.5 to 12 wt. -% of a polymeric formaldehyde, based on natural resinic acid, b) partial esterification of the product of a) at at least 200 ° C, but at temperature increase by at least 20 ° C to a) under atmospheric pressure to acid number 115 to 135, c) partial utilization of the product from b) at at least 200 ° C with alkaline calcium compound, that 3.5 to 4 wt. -% Calcium to 100 parts by weight of reaction product. d) Neutralization of the unreacted base from the product from C) with 10 to 50 wt. -%, based on the calcium compound, saturated C₁₋₁₆ monocarboxylic acid up to the acid number 20 to 40 at at least 200 ° C and simultaneous completion of the salt formation E₁) Isolation of the product from D) E₂) Modification at least one step b) to d) with up to 5 wt. -% natural resin acids. Use of the products as binders for printing inks.
