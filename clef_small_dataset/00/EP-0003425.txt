<ABSTRACT>
an intermetallic compound having a dual diamond  crystal structure (e. g.  lial, licd or lizn) is formed on a  substrate surface.  a layer containing the constituent elements  is first formed on the substrate, and is then heated in a  magnetic field set at a selected angle (e. g.  0° or 90°) to the  layer.  a crystalline film of the compound is formed with a  major crystallographic plane aligned with the magnetic field.   the substrate may be a sheet of one of the constituent  metals (e. g.  al, cd or zn), and the layer formed by impinging  ions of the other metal (e. g.  li) onto the substrate surface.  the crystalline film produced can be used as a substrate  for the growth of crystalline silicon.  apparatus for performing the method includes means  (105, 106) for positioning and heating (110) the substrate  (104) within the magnetic field established by the magnet  (101, 102).  means (107) can also be provided for firing ions of  one of the metals (e. g.  li, 108) onto the substrate (104).   similar means (113) can be provided to fire silicon (112) ions  onto the crystalline film after its formation.  the apparatus  may be contained in a vacuum chamber.
