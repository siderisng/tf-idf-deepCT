<ABSTRACT>
an organic material of which the colour change under  the influence of light is minimised by the inclusion therein  of a light-fugitive dye of appropriate hue which fades at  such rate, relative to the development of colour in the  organic material, that the change in colour of the organic  material on exposure to light is less than would occur in  the absence of the dye.  permits the manufacture of polyurethanes which  undergo minimal colour change on exposure to light.
