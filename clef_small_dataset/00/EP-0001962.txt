<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for folding a sheet of material, for example  a newspaper, through an angle of 180° by conveying the  material between a rotatable element provided with one or  more blades and an element for receiving the material folded  by said blade or blades.  the element for receiving the  material when folded by said blade or blades comprises two  rollers (4, 5) which are moved at a speed corresponding to  the conveying speed of the material or substantially corresponding  to said speed.  the two rollers (4, 5) are further  arranged to be displaced in a circular arculate path, and the  blade (8) is arranged to adopt a position between the rollers  (4, 5) at a position (figure 4) of the rollers during the  revolution.  said two rollers are coupled together and form  together a circular arculate path, but with a blade (6)  orientated through the axes of rotation of the rollers (4, 5)  constantly adopting one and the same horizontal or vertical  direction.
