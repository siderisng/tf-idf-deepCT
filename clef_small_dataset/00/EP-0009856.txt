<ABSTRACT>
the underwater apparatus for inspecting a submerged  object comprises an underwater vehicle (14) capable for  transporting humans and equipment to a submerged object  (12).  in order to enable the interior of the object (12) to be  inspected, a portable acoustic probe (16) is provided.  the  housing of the probe (16) contains in addition a light source  and a television camera.  the diver carries a package (20) with  the transmitter and receiver for the ultrasonic transducer  array and some acoustical image electronics.  at the rear of  the probe (16) is located a display so that the diver may  obtain a visual image of the acoustical information.  the  probe (16), the diver and the underwater vehicle (14) are  interconnected by a cable (22).  the operator within the craft  (14) may visually monitor both the acoustical and the optical  image display.  means are provided for storing the electrical  signals in the vehicle (14).
