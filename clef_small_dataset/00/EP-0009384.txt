<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula (i)    (in which x represents hs- or a group r₁r₂n- wherein r₁  and r₂ which may be the same or different represent hydro­ gen or a straight or branched chain alkyl group containing  from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group and r₃ repre­ sents a c₃₋₇ alkyl group or a c₃₋₇, cycloalkyl group) are  prepared by reacting an α-ketoester of the formula (ii)    (in which alk represents an alkyl group) or a precursor  thereof with a compound of the formula (iii)  the precursor of the compound of formula (ii) may  be a mixture of isomeric enol esters  the compounds of formua (i) may be converted into  compounds of formula (viii)    in which r₁ and r₂ which may be the same or different re­ present hydrogen or a straight or branched chain alkyl  group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and r₃ is as  defined above.
