<ABSTRACT>
conversion of raw coal to distillate liquid and gaseous  hydrocarbon products by solvent liquefaction in the presence  of molecular hydrogen employing recycle of mineral  residue is commonly performed at a higher thermal efficiency  than conversion of coal to pipeline gas in a gasification  process employing partial oxidation and methanation reactions.   the prior art has disclosed a combination coal  liquefaction-gasification process employing recycle of mineral  residue in the liquefaction zone wherein all the normally  solid dissolved coal produced in the liquefaction zone is  passed to a gasification zone for conversion to hydrogen,  where the amount of normally solid dissolved coal prepared  and passed to the gasification zone is just sufficient to enable  the gasification zone to produce the exact hydrogen requirement  of the process.  the present invention provides an  unexpected improvement in the thermal efficiency of the  combination process by utilizing formulas based on feed  coal characteristics to calculate an amount of normally solid  dissolved coal to be prepared in the liquefaction zone and  passed to the gasification zone to enable the gasification  zone to generate not only all of the hydrogen required by the  liquefaction zone but also to produce synthesis gas for use as  fuel in the liquefaction zone.  it would have been expected  that shifting some of the processing load from the ordinarily  more efficient liquefaction zone to the ordinarily less efficient  gasification zone would decrease process efficiency, but the  present combination process unexpectedly achieves an  overall efficiency increase by said shift.
