<ABSTRACT>
a tracer machining system has drivers for driving a  tracer head along x-, y- and z-axes, and tracer control  relies on x-axis, y-axis and z-axis signals, which are dis­ placement signals (εx, εy, εz) representing tracer head  displacement along the x-, y- and z-axes.  to permit feed along any desired feed axis (a) in the  x-y plane, not just along the x- or y-axis, tracer control  apparatus has circuits (22; 10, 11, 14) for multiplying sig­ nals (cosα, sinα) representing the direction (azimuth  angle α) of the desired feed axis (a) by the x- and y-axis  signals (εx, εy) respectively, and for adding the multiplica­ tion results together to obtain a signal (εα) representing  tracer head displacement in relation to the feed axis (a).  the control apparatus also has circuits (18, 19) for  multiplying the signals (cosα, sinα) representing the di­ rection (α) of the desired feed axis (a) by a signal (vα)  for controlling feed rate along the feed axis (a) to provide  resultant signals (vx and vy) for controlling feed rates  along the x-axis and y-axis, so that a selected feed rate  along the feed axis (a) is achieved.
