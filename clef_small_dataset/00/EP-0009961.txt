<ABSTRACT>
a spring brake actuator including a powerful compres­ sion spring (72) which acts through a spring retaining plate  (74) and a piston (50) to urge an elongated shaft (45) to trans­ late through a bushing (48) while substantially avoiding the  application of lateral forces to such shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
actuator for use in a braking system this invention relates to improvements in pneumatic spring brake actuators. more specifically, it relates to improvements in spring brake actuators which provide improved performance and extended durability. spring brake actuators of various designs are widely used in the trucking/transport industry due to their many advantageous operational characteristics. examples of the actuators and apparatus known in the art to which this invention pertains are shown in the following united states patents: patent no. 3,109,347 issued to e. j. brodl et al. on november 5, 1963; patent no. 3,117,496 issued to h. l. dobrikin on january 14, 1964; patent no. 3,131,609 issued to h. l. dobrikin et al. on may 5, 1964; patent no. 3,182,566 issued to a. a. berg et al on may 11, 1965; patent no. 3,182,849 issued to c. horowitz et al. on may 11, 1965, patent no. 3,302,530 issued to h.l. dobrikin et al. on february 7, 1977; patent no. 3,331,291 issued to b j. rumsey on july 18, 1967; patent : no. 3,502,003 issued to h. l. dobrikin et al. on march 24, 1970; patent no. 3,581,627 issued to s. campanini on june 1, 1971; patent no. 3,636,822 issued to c. horowitz on january 25, 1972; and patent no. 3,908,520 issued to j. w. ma on september 30, 1975. as is well known to those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains, spring brake actuators automatically apply the brakes of a transport vehicle upon a substantial interruption in supply pressure to the actuators. this application is accomplished through the aegis of a powerful spring. more specifically, under normal operating conditions, the spring is compressed by a piston or other suitable means under the influence of supply pressure when ever the supply pressure is interrupted, however, the spring is allowed to expand thereby forcing the piston and connected piston shaft to translate in adirection to actuate the vehicle brakes. under such condition, the shaft translates through an expensive airtight bushing mounted in a chamber bulkhead. however, as the spring expands, it may exert underirable transverse forces on the piston and shaft. as a result, the shaft, when moving through the bushing, may be forced out of coaxial alignment with the axis of the bushing causing wear and deterioration of the bushing. moreover, as the spring expands in the absence of supply pressure, it is desirable to equalize pressures on each side of the piston to ensure unhindered movement of the piston and full effect of the spring force. this equalization is most desirably accomplished without requiring the ingress of ambient air to the actuator, thereby avoiding possible contamination by dust and other foreign matter. it is a general object of this invention to provide an improved brake actuator. it is a more specific object of this invention to provide a brake actuator including apparatus for minimizing the wear on an airtight bushing through which the actuating shaft extends. it is a more specific object of this invention to provide
