<ABSTRACT>
the instant invention is directed to a novel catalyst sys­ tem for the production of polyurethane resin, and the method  of use of such catalyst system.  the catalyst systems of the  instant invention broadly comprise   (a) a tertiary amine,   (b) a tin compound capable of catalyzing the reaction bet­ ween an isocyanate group and an active hydrogen atom, and   (c) a compound of the formula:   (r-coo)₂me   wherein me represents calcium or barium, and   r represents a hydrocarbon group.  it has been found that the component (c) tends to catalyze side  reactions which occur during foaming between isocyanate  groups and the initial reaction products of isocyanates and  active hydrogen containing compounds.
