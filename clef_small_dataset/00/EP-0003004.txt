<ABSTRACT>
In a device for screwing in screws with washers, the problem of the automatic supply of the screws and the washers should be released. The screws are supplied by a laterally arranged magazine (11) via a carrier strip and brought into the feed shaft by means of the grippers (24). Further, a magazine (10) is provided for the washers, which washers are supplied by a slider displaceable or pivotable transversely to the screw-in axis. the control of the slides supplying the washers and the gripper feeding the screws takes place depending on the feed movement of the screw device, wherein different control rods (6, 7) and encapsing are provided for this purpose, which in grooves of rotary bodies or on pivotable levers Plant come. By special profile of the grooves and the formation of the levers, a rotary or displacement movement of the required parts is achieved.
