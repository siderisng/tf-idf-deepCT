<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for producing metal flake of  small length-to-width ratio or small length-to-thickness  ratio directly from a pool or like source of molten metal or  molten inorganic compound, or from an unconfined drop  of molten metal or an unconfined drop of molten inorganic  compound having a surface tension and viscosity similar  to that of molten metal, consisting of forming such products  by the application of a rotating heat-extracting disk-like  member (20) having a generally circular serrated edge  to the surface of the pool of molten material (21) so as to  form the material into discrete flake particles by extracting  the flake particles from the supply of molten material; and  controlling the final shape of the product by the physical  shape of the member, the temperature and material composition  of the melt, as well as the velocity of the member  in contact with the melt.
