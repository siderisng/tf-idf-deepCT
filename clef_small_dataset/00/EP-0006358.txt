<ABSTRACT>
a burner for reduced nox emission and also for the  control of the shape of the flame as regards its length  and spread, comprises a first combustion zone (20), which  is contained within a cylindrical chamber (22) lined with  refractory material (24).  a burner tube (36) is inserted  through an opening (28) in the upstream end of the first  combustion zone (20), the burner including means for  providing and burning liquid and gaseous fuel.  a first air  plenum (14) is provided upstream of the first combustion  zone (20) with means for supplying less-than-stoichiome­ tric combustion air in a tangential swirling manner, prior  to entering the first combustion zone.  a second air ple­ num (16) is provided coaxial with and surrounding the  first combustion zone and tertiary air (72) is supplied tan­ gentially to this air plenum so that the tertiary air will  flow in a helical swirling motion along the outside of the  first combustion chamber (20), around the downstream  end of the combustion chamber and will meet and mix  with the hot products of combustion from the first com­ bustion chamber.  control of the shape of the flame is  provided by controlling the relative directions of tangen­ tial flow of air in the two plena.
