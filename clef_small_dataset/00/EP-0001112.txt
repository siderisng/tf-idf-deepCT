<ABSTRACT>
1.  a fastening device (20) for swinging and/or hinged tailgates (22) of freight-carrying vehicles, in particular lorries and their trailers, having a tailgate pin (30) which is disposed on the upper corner of the tailgate parallel to the pivoting axis thereof and is held in an outer seat (34) partially surrounding the said tailgate pin (30) and open in the direction of the path of travel (b) of the tailgate pin by means of a lockable pivoting member (40, 130), which is disposed beneath the end position of the tailgate pin and can be pivoted away downwards and the actuating elements of which are situated in the space between the lateral edge (21) of the tailgate and the plane described by the tip (31) of the tailgate pin when pivoting, and have an actuating means pressing directly against the pivoting member (40, 130) and a locking device going slightly beyond a dead centre characterised in that an actuating rod (73) which is moved essentially vertically is provided and the actuating means is in the form of an angled lever (123) or an angled thrust member (63), which has a bearing shaft (65) to be positioned close to the outside edge of the vehicle and an angled thrust member part (67) or angled lever arm (127) projecting upwards and pressing against the pivoting member (40, 130), and the axis of application (72) for the actuating rod (73) lies, in the locking position, approximately at the level of the bearing shaft (65) and offset at a distance from the latter towards the load platform (28).
