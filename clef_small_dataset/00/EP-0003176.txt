<ABSTRACT>
a machine for packaging items into plastic bags, and a  sealing device for use therewith, said sealing device having  heat sealing means and a separate cutting wire.  plastics bags can be provided with a wide and hence  strong seal using the heat sealing means while the material  is neatly trimmed between the edges of the seal using the  wire.  the wire need not be heated.  the wire may be mounted  on a first jaw (13) while the heat sealing means is mounted  on a second jaw (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
a machine for nackaginf items into plastics bags, and a sealing device for use therewith the invention relates to a machine for packaging items into plastics bags and to a device for sealing the bags after they have been packed. the sealing device not only heat seals the bag but also cuts through the bag between the edges of the seal to trim off waste at the mouth ofthe bag and leave a neat, sealed mouth. known heat sealers of this type employ a heated knife or wire which cuts through the plastics material and welds the plastics material together simultaneously. an example is described in united states patent specification o.3653377- tfte known sealers have the disadvantage that they only provide a narrow seal, which is therefore often weak. the invention as claimed is intended to make it possible to for: a seal which can be as wiae as desired, while still retaining the good cutting piopcrties of a wire. according to the invention separate heat sealing means are used in addition to the cutting wire. the separate heat sealing means can be made substantially wider than the wire. another disadvantage of knohm devices such as that of u.s. patent lio.3653177 is that there is considerable oxidation of the plastics material bringing about considerable odour and smoke which is unpleasant and dangerous for the operator and causes air pollution. this disadvantage is reduced by a preferred feature of the invention in which the sealing device comprises a pair of jaws between which the plastics material can be gripped. the jaws effectively smother the area of plastics material being heated, ubstantially reducing oxidation. the use of a pair of jaws also conveniently means that the heating means can be arranged on one jaw and the cutting wire on the other jaw. it is not essential for the cutting wire to be heated. tnu heating means may comprise an electrical heating element and to increase output of a maching using the sealing device, control means may be provided arranged alternately to supply a pulse of electricity to the element, furthered by a blast of air to cool the element. to faciltate this the element may be mounted on a support (e.g. a hollow.jaw) which has passages therethrough, through which the cooling air is directed. the invention includes a machine for packaging items into plastics bags, the machine being fitted with a sealing device according to the invention. one way of carrying out the invention is described in deatil below with reference to drawings which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which: figure 1 is a perspective view of a plastics bag handling machine fitted with a sealing device according to the invention; figure 2 is a front view of a first jaw of the sealing device; figure 3 is a transverse cross-section through the jaw 5;!0wz in inure 2; figure 4 is a front view of a second jaw of the sealing device; and figure 5 is a transverse cross-section through the
