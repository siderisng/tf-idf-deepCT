<ABSTRACT>
an object identification system has a transmitter (8)  supplying a signal (m13) from an inductor (3) of a transÂ­ mitter (8) by low loss near-field coupling to an inductor  (1) of a transponder (5) on the object to be identified.   the energy of this signal (m13) is stored in a capacitor  (6) and re-radiated by the inductor (1), at a reduced  frequency formed in effect by cancellation of part of the  incoming wave, to an inductor (2) of a receiver (7) as a  reply signal (m12).  the reduction in frequency is achieved  by a switching system in the transponder (5) which is  controlled by a control signal (p1) from a control circuit  (4).  this control circuit may be powered by energy (p2)  from the inductor (1).  the switching is performed by a  fet (tr1) and occurs at suitable points in the operating  cycle to ensure the minimum energy loss.  the operation  of switching is coded in code generator (20) to produce  a desired reply signal (m12) carrying information about  the object  to be identified.
