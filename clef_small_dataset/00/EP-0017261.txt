<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for winding and twisting yarn  onto a spool directly from an extrusion line or other  production source by means of an inline twister.  the inline  twister comprises the following elements: a rotatable spin­ dle, a bottom flange securely fastened to the spindle having  a catch on the outer periphery, a removable interlocking top  flange positioned on the spindle, means for positioning the  spool concentrically about the spindle, a twister ring concen­ trically positioned about the spindle having a slit, and a  rotatable traveler positioned on the twister ring having a  hook inwardly directed toward the spindle.  the method of winding and twisting the yarn onto a  spool comprises guiding the yarn adjacent to the spool.  this  yarn is then positioned adjacent to the slit in the twister ring  and is allowed to pass therein.  the spindle on which the  spool is contained is then rotated so that the catch-equipped  bottom flange contacts the yarn and holds it tight.  as the  yarn is rotated by the bottom flange it contacts the hook  equipped rotatable traveler positioned on the twister ring  and this combination of rotating flange and traveler provides  the means for inserting twist into the yarn as well as  wrapping the yarn about the spool.  as the yarn is wound  about the spool the twister ring is reciprocated so that the  point of collection varies about the spool.
