<ABSTRACT>
a method for producing flake particles by projecting a  stream of molten material (21) upon the surface of a rotating,  generally circular, heat-extracting drum (20), having a  serrated edge (42), with each serration comprising a radial  surface and an angularly disposed connecting surface from  the base of one radial surface (24) to the peripheral extremity  of the adjacent radial surface; and rotating the heat-extracting  drum (20) at a speed relative to the size and shape of the  serrations and relative to the rate of molten material projec足 tion to form a discrete flake particle on each angularly (23)  disposed surface; followed by removing each particle from  the surface after each particle is at least partially solidified;  and cooling the particles in a surrounding atmosphere.  an apparatus for producing flake particles comprising  means for projecting a stream of molten material (21) upon a  rotatable heat-extracting drum member (20) having a serrated  generally circular peripheral edge (42), with each serration  having a radial surface (24) and an angular surface (23) con足 necting the base of one radial surface with the peripheral  extremity of the next radial surface; and a shaft (22) support足 ing the heat-extracting member for rotation at a controlled  speed; with means responsive to the rate of projection of the  molten material (21) upon the serrated surface of the heat-足 extracting member to control its speed of rotation relative to  the rate of projection of molten material.
