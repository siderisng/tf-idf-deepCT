<ABSTRACT>
for subjecting a continuous strip of metallic-material or  stock to an applied high tension for a drawing, straightening  or stretching process, apparatus is disclosed which comprises  a pair of elastic ring-equipped roll assemblies for holding the  material there-between under a high tension applied by the  roll assemblies.  the elastic ring (5,6) of each roll assembly is  capable of elastic deformation which elongatesthe area of the  ring in contact with the material (13) along the circumference  of the ring as applied tension increases, thus increasing the  contact area over which the applied force is distributed  evenly.  this results in a reduction of the force per unit area.   each elastic ring is mounted on a shaft (1,2).  at least one of the  shafts being drivable, by way of at least three rollers (3,3a 3b;  4, 4a, 4b) which are interposed between the ring (5,6) and  shaft (1,2) for axial rotation and two of which (3,3a; 4,4b) are  arranged to bridge the ring over the ring contacting area of the  material.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates generally to processing a strip of metallic material or stock under an applied high tension, and more particularly to method and apparatus which provides a high tensioning force for a material or stock drawing, straightening or stretching process. in the art of drawing, straightening or stretching a strip of metal such as a bar or coil stock of round, square or other cross section, there is known no method or apparatus of the type which can provide a high tension for processing the stock without causing damageto the stock material. according to a known method or apparatus, if a high tension should be applied to the material, it would be very likely to be damaged by the rollers or similar means which hold and pull it therebetween. the damage would more frequently tend to occur and become more significant as the tensioning force is increased. for this reason, it is the practice to provide additional means to prevent such damage. for example, when a material is subjected to different tensile forces supplied by one tensioning apparatus, preliminary provision should disadvan- tageously be made so as not to damage the material under the maximum applied tensile force. it-is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved material tensioning methodand apparatus for use in draving, straightening or stretching a strip of material. the invention provides in one aspect a material tensioning method for placing a continuous- strip of metallic material or stock under allappliea high tension for a drawing, straightening or stretching process, comprising: holding the material between a pair of elastic rn equipped tensioning roll means; increasing a tensile force provided by said tensioning roll means to place the material under the increased tension; and enlarging that area ofthe elastic ring in each of the roll means which contacts the material as the tensile force provided by the roll means increases, whereby the enlarged contact area of the ring can evenly distribute the amount of the applied pressure upon the material, resulting in a reduction in the applied pressure per unit area. eteferably,'the contact area of the elastic ring is elongated in a circumferential direction of the ring by elastically deforming the ring the invention provides in another aspect material tensioning apparatus for placing a continuous strip of metallic material or stock under an applied high tension for a drawing, straightening or stretching process, comprising: - a pair of parallel spaced shafts at least one of which is drivable and a pair of vensioning elastic ring-equippe#d roll means mounted on the correspondingÂ¯ shafts for holding therebetween the material under a. high tension, in use, applied by said roll means, the elastic ring of each of said roll means being capable of elastic deformation which elongates the area of the ring in contact with the material along the circumference of the ring as said applied tension increases. preferably, each of said roll means includes a plurality of regularly-spaced rollers interposed for axial rotation between
