<ABSTRACT>
a forward viewing aid for vehicle drivers is intended  particularly for drivers driving on the other side of the road to  that for which their vehicles are equipped.  it consists of a pair of mirrors (13, 14) arranged side by  side so that the driver extends his field of view to see around  obstructions ahead of the vehicle.  one mirror (13) is a  forward-facing mirror and reflections from this mirror are  transmitted to the other mirror (14) which faces the driver.  in one arrangement the mirrors are in a box-like assembly  supported adjustably on a stem (11) which is in turn mounted  on a bracket (12) clamped to the vehicle.  to provide for the bracket (12) to be readily detached from  the vehicle, there is a clamping arrangement by which the  bracket (12) is only removable on lifting the vehicle bonnet.

<DESCRIPTION>
forward viewing aid for vehicle drivers this invention relates to a forward viewing aid for vehicle drivers. vehicle driver viewing aids in the form of mirrors are known which give a rearward view to the vehicle driver and these mirrors take various forms. for example, the mirrors may be mounted within the vehicle or externally on the forward wings or the doors. such mirrors are also known which are mounted on extensions or which are in the form of periscopes to enable the driver to see around trailers or caravans. it has also been proposed to provide a mirror located within the vehicle whereby a forward view can be achieved but this mirror has not proved popular due to the need to locate it away from the driver's normal line of vision. however, a need for forward-viewing aids for vehicle drivers exists especially when a vehicle travels on the opposite side of the road to that for which it is equipped, for example, a vehicle equipped with a right-hand side driving position which is driven on the right hand side of the road. in such a case the driver must move his vehicle towards the crown of the road in order to see past a vehicle in front and to determine whether the road is clear for overtaking. this procedure is hazardous, as is a similar procedure when it is necessary for the driver to pull out to see past a large preceding vehicle when in the usual driving position. an object of the invention is to provide a forward viewing aid for vehicle drivers which enables a vehicle driver to have a wider field of vision in the forward direction than is possible from the driving position when unaided. according to one aspect of the invention a forward viewing aid for vehicle drivers comprises two reflecting elements, means for mounting the reflecting elements in juxtaposition relative to one another such that an image ahead of the vehicle received by one reflecting element is reflected from such element to the other reflecting element and the image can be viewed directly by the driver as a reflection from said other reflecting element. preferably the planes of the reflecting elements are arranged at an acute angle in the range 14-200 to each other, and said one reflecting element receiving the image has a convex reflecting surface. conveniently the radius of said one reflecting element is in the range 1500-4000 mm and said other reflecting element for viewing the image has a flat reflecting surface. according to another aspect of the invention a mounting bracket for vehicles comprises an upper part to which a device to be mounted is attachable, the upper part having a surface arranged to engage a portion of the vehicle adjacent an edge of said portion, a lower part carried on the upper part and arranged to locate around said edge to lie opposite said surface and adjustment means interconnecting the upper and lower parts for effecting relative movement

<CLAIMS>
claims   1. a forward viewing aid for vehicle drivers  characterised by two reflecting elements    (13, 14; 113,    114), mounting means (16, 17;  40, 41, 46) for mounting the reflecting elements  in juxtaposition relative to one another such  that an image ahead of the vehicle received by one  reflecting element is reflected from such element  to the other reflecting element and the image can  be viewed directly by the driver as a reflection  from said other reflecting element.   2. an aid according to claim 1 characterised in that  the planes of the reflecting elements (13, 14;  113, 114) are arranged at an acute angle in the    0  range 10-20 to each other.      3. an aid according to claim   l    or 2 characterised in  that said one reflecting element (13; 113) receiving  the image has a convex reflecting surface.   4. an aid according to claim 3 characterised in that  the radius of said one element (13; 113) is in  the range 1500-4000 mm.   5. an aid according to any one of the preceding claims  characterised in that said other reflecting  element (14; 114) for viewing the image has a  flat reflecting surface.   6. an aid according to any one of the preceding claims  characterised in that the reflecting elements  (13, 14; 113, 114) are generally rectangular and  are spaced apart in a direction transverse to the  reflecting surfaces of the elements in  overlapping relationship.     7. an aid according to any one of the preceding  claims characterised in that the mounting means  (16, 17; 40, 41, 46) for the reflecting elements  (13, 14; 113, 114) interconnects the two  reflecting elements to maintain the elements in  fixed relationship to one another without  obstructing the light path to the driver.   8. an aid according to claim 7 characterised by a  stem (23) extending downwardly from the mounting  means (16, 17) and having a mounting bracket (12)  at its lower end, the mounting bracket including  an upper part (30) of which a surface is arranged  to engage an upwardly-facing portion (35) of a  vehicle adjacent an edge of said portion, and a  lower part (34) carried adjustably on the upper  part and arranged to engage around said edge  and under said upwardly facing portion (35),  whereby the upper and lower parts are fixable on  the vehicle by adjustment of the upper and lower  parts to clamp the bracket on the vehicle.   9. an aid according to claim 8 characterised in that  the mounting-means (16, 17) is adjustable relative  to the mounting bracket (12) to adjust the  orientation of the reflecting elements (13, 14)  relative to the vehicle driver.    10. a mounting bracket for vehicles comprising an  upper part to which a device to be mounted is  attachable and a lower part, characterised in that  the upper part (30) has a surface arranged to  engage a portion (35) of the vehicle adjacent an  edge of said portion, the lower part (34) being  carried on the upper part and arranged to locate  around said edge to lie opposite said surface, and characterised by adjustment means (33) interconnecting the upper and lower parts (30 and 34) for effecting relative movement of the parts to clamp the parts on said portion (35) of the vehicle, the arrangement being such that the upper and lower parts are clampable around the edge of a bonnet member of the vehicle when the bonnet is raised and cannot be released with the bonnet in a lowered position.
