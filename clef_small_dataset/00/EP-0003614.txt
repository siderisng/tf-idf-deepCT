<ABSTRACT>
1.  fire barrier for sealing and closing openings (63) in walls and ceiling comprising an external surrounding frame (10, 10a) of metal with related securing brackets (23) (24) and inserted sealing frame (13) surrounding the opening (63) at a specific distance, constructed of fire resistant insulation panels (17, 18, 19) sealing lips (15, 19) and a sealing element (14) of first resistant insulation panels (17, 18, 19) arranged in a movable manner therein with an internal metal frame (12), closing up in an overlapping manner the whole clear area of the opening (63) and desired over its whole area with a thickness corresponding to the fire resistance class to be met, in particular for use in the case of transport system openings, characterized in that metal sections form an external surrounding frame (10) and (10a) with such a shape that the fixed insulating sealing frame (13) surrounding the opening in the wall or ceiling, and the movable sealing element (14) lined with the totally or at least partially surrounding metal frame (12) are arranged and secured in such a way that firstly in each case an overlap on the sides (a) is formed in which on the sealing frame (13) at least one sealing lip (15) and in the body of the movable sealing element (14) at least one selaing groove (16) can be accommodated, secondly on the exit side a certain overlap (h) is formed and thirdly on the entry side a certain overlap (g) is formed so that at no point can there arise an efficient thermally conductive connection from the surface of the fire barrier to the opposite side of the opening ; and in that on the external surrounding frame (10) an automatic closing device (64) is arranged which is connected to the sealing element (14) via a lever arm (67) pre-tensioned for power storage in the open position and held fast there by a locking system (73) separable in the event of a fire ; and in that a drive (80) is provided which acts on the lever arm (67).
