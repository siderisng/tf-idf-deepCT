<ABSTRACT>
For grease pressing with a grease-absorbing container tube (1), it is desirable to be able to protrude from the fat and the container tube in the fat air from hand and without complicated pressing. This is possible if at one end of the container tube (1) an attachment (3) with pump (4) is seated and a narrow air outlet opening (8) is provided at this end; When an inner lid (16) is provided at the other end of the container tube, to which a drawbar (13) is guided, which carries a pressure sleeve (9) and a compression spring (22); and when the drawbar (13) is detectable by means of a clamping device which has a terminal piece (20) cooperable via an actuating piece (21) operable with the pull rod. The extended pull rod (13) can be detected exactly in the axial direction and pressed by pressure on the pull rod the pressure sleeve (9) against the grease, so that in the fat air can escape through the air outlet opening (8).
