<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus comprises integrated circuit chips (10)  which are to be cooled.  heat is conducted from the chips (10)  to a cold plate (38) by a transfer path including spring biased  heat conducting members (26) and housing (16).  the members  (26a) contacting low powered chips (10a) have a portion  of reduced diameter which increases the thermal resistance of  the heat transfer path from those low powered chips (10a).  the members (26) contacting high powered chips (10)  have no such reduced portion and have a lower thermal resistance.   the different thermal resistances introduced by the  members (26), (26a) permit both high and low powered components  to attain their optimum operating temperature.
