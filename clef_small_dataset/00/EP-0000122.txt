<ABSTRACT>
where a plurality of cells are built into the rotor of an ultracentrifuge for optical interference investigations, at equal spacing from the fulcrum, to provide the possibility of observing each cell the principal beam through each cell must have a different spacing from the axis of rotation.  the deflection of the beams is achieved by prismatically ground windows (4 or 5), which delimit at the top and at the bottom the chambers to receive the liquid to be investigated.  the central parts (2) of the cells, which parts are difficult to process, and consist of special materials, are designed to be plane-parallel.  <image>
