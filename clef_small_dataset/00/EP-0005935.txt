<ABSTRACT>
in applying to an externally threaded bottle neck an  unthreaded metal closure having a gasket within it, the  closure shell is pressed down on the bottle and whilst the  shell is so held the diameter of the upper end of the skirt is  reduced at angularly spaced intervals to press the gasket into  sealing engagement with a cylindrical sealing surface on the  neck of the bottle above the bottle thread and simultaneously  to form a band of knurling which can be grasped manually.
