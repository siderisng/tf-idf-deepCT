<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for upsetting a tube end using a  one-piece upset die (42).  the tube (30) is heated at the end to  be upset and secured in a gripper clamp (32) so as to remain  stationary during the upset operation.  the upset die (42) is  hydraulically forced over the tube end and a mandrel (36) is  hydraulically positioned into the tube end.  a longitudinal  compressive force is then hydraulically applied to upset the  tube end.  the upset die (42) is hydraulically pulled off the  upset tube (30) thereby accomplishing removal of the tube  (30) from the one-piece die (42) without damage to the tube  (30) or the die (42).
