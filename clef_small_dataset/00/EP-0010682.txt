<ABSTRACT>
A device for transmitting a signal, e.g. b. the output signal of a greater, about a certain distance and / or to another electrical potential level. The transmission device consists of a transmitter (S) and a receiver (M) which are connected to each other via an optical connection. The transmitter contains links (2-7, 31, 32) for combining incoming measurement signals (UIN) with setpoint signals (VREF) to two different signals which transmit over each 1 of two parallel optical pots (8, 9) to the EMP catcher become. The receiver contains Anord's nams for receiving the two transmitted signals and for regulating the gain in the two transmission channels. This scheme balances parameter variations in the two channels and associated components. The receiver also includes links forming from the two transmitted signals of the output signal (UUT) of the transmission device which depends on the input signal of the transmitter.
