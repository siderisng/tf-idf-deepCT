<ABSTRACT>
feeder apparatus is provided for delivering a predetermined  amount of feed to hogs and like live-stock.  the  apparatus includes a feed transporting and dispensing  conveyor (26) with which are associated a plurality of feeder  units (25); each unit receives and temporarily stores the feed.   each unit includes a feed receiver body (31).  a boot (34)  extends from the body (31) and defines a discharge opening  (44).  a pear-shaped stopper valve (40) carried in the boot fits  into and onto the discharge opening to obstruct the flow.  a  stopper valve pull system (47) acts to draw the stopper valve  away from the discharge opening, thereby permitting feed  flow; if desired, this pull system can be connected to a timer  so as to discharge the feed at a pre-selected moment.  the  stopper valve includes a semi-spheroidal element (41)  adapted to fit into and onto the discharge opening and a  conical element (42) adapted to be drawn through the feed  pile so as to discourage feed bridging and hang-up within the  feeder unit body.  a discharge tube extending into the feeder  unit body includes an extensible and retractable bellows  member (52) for varying the height of the feed pile to be  collected within the feeder unit.
