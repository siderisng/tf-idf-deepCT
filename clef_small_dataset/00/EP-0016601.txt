<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to handled thermo-plastic  bag structures which are designed to avoid stress concentra­ tion in the areas of the bag which are most susceptible to  rupture.  these areas occur principally around the cut-edges  which are formed at the bag mouth or around minute nicks  and tears immediately adjacent to the bag mouth edge and  caused as a result of separating forces developed in an indi­ vidual bag along a perforating line during typical loading  operations.  the bag structures are characterized by a plurality  of pleats (15) being located along the edges of the bag mouth  and in an area of the bag walls adjacent the lower portions of  the handles.

<DESCRIPTION>
in the past, bags often had separate carrying handles. the carrying handles, distinct from the bag structure itself, were fed into a machine for attachment adjacent to the open mouth portion of the bag. the manufacturing operation to produce bags of this kind, with its separate process step of supplying the handling element and applying them to the bag was cumbersone and uneconomical. more recently, however, bag structures have been developed in which the carrying handles are formed as an integral part of the bag structure itself see, for example, u.s. patents nos. 4085822; 3352411 and 3180557. one example of such a bag structure is one that is constructed from a flattened tube or a flattened side edge gusseted tube. a flattened portion of such a tube is cut off and sealed along its top and bottom edges. conversely, such a bag may be formed by folding a piece of the thermoplastic material on itself, the bottom fold line constituting the bottom part of the bag and heat sealing the upper edge and side wall parts of the bag together. next, a u-shaped cutout is made in the upper portion of the bag to provide an opening or entrance for the introduction of goods into the bag. the opposite edges of the upper portion of the bag structure immediately adjacent to the cutout area form loops which may be used to carry the bag when they are loaded. in the case of a gusseted tube, the handle loops are reinforced, i.e., are of double thickness, by virtue of the re-entrant or gusset folds in the loop handles. bags of this type have exhibited structural failures in the areas which are most susceptible to stress concentr & tion when the handle loops of the bag are separated and temporarily suspended on a loading fixture for bag filling operations, as described in u.s patent no. 43085,82?. the areas of stress concentration are usually located at areas adjacent to the lower portion of the bag handles. additionally, it has been found when the bag structure is fabricated from high density polyethylene film there is a pronounced tendency for tears to be initiated along the edge of cutout portions. these tears are usually in the machine direction of the film, i.e., in the direction in which the film is originally extruded. this direction usually corresponds to the lengthwise direction of the bag, that is, from the bag top to the bag bottom. such tears, once initiated, quickly propagate in the machine direction, resulting in a bag failure. these problems are particularly troublesome with polymers which exhibit a high modulus or stiffness and low machine direction tear strength, e.g., high density polyethylene and polypropylene. the problem is also aggravated by the small tears or nicks which are created by the cutting dies used to cut the bags while they are arranged in a stack. we have now devised a bag structure which eliminates or substantially reduces the severity of the structural deficiencies of the bags

<CLAIMS>
what is claimed is:    1. a thermoplastic bag structure having front and rear wall members, an open mouth, and a pair of handles formed integrally with the front and rear walls and located at opposite ends of the mouth, characterized by a plurality of pleats being located along the   edges -of    the bag mouth and in an area of the bag walls adjacent the lower portions of the handles.
