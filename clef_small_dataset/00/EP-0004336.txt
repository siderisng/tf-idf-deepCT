<ABSTRACT>
1.  a seal arrangement comprising a housing (1) which forms a housing aperture (4), a rod (2) which is moved in the housing aperture (4) in the longitudinal direction or in a rotating manner, and an exchangeable seal ring which shuts the housing aperture (4) between the rod (2) and the housing (1) and which is made of an elastomeric material and which, with an internal ring area (14), co-operates with the rod surface and which is held by a profiled part (5) which projects outwardly from its profiled body (16) and engages behind a housing collar (8), the seal ring containing in a groove (9), which opens towards the front in the direction of the assembly side, a ring which extends backwardly as far as the cross-sectional zone of the radially projecting profiled part (5) and which is made of a harder material, characterised in that the outwardly projecting profiled part (5) is altogether displaced in the axial direction with respect to the ring area (14) co-operating with the rod (2), and in that the radial clearance (15) between this part and the rod (2) is such that the seal ring does not at any point inside the collar (8) or therebehind have a radial thickness which, after the deduction of the radial clearance (15) between it and the rod (2) and the radial width of the groove (9), is larger than the distance of the collar (8) from the rod (2), and in that the radial clearance between the ring in a harder material which, after the assembly of the seal ring, is insertable into the groove (9), which extends in a substantially axially parallel manner, and which acts as a supporting ring (10) and the collar (8) is so minimal in relation to the mutual radial overlapping of the collar (8) and the profiled part (5) engaging therebehind that the radially projecting profiled part (5) is prevented from carrying out an inwardly directed movement of detachment.
