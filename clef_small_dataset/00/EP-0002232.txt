<ABSTRACT>
a data acquisition system utilizing a microcomputer and  incorporating a plurality of monitors each adapted to  produce an electrical signal indicative of a physical condition  of apparatus to be monitored.  the electrical signals are fed  via multiplexing equipment and analog-to-digital converters  into the microcomputer which is equipped with print-out  means.  the system is such that the level of any one or all of  the signals from the respective monitors can be printed out  as well as a change in the condition of any signal.  means are  incorporated into the computer for calculating and printing  the trend (i. e. , the slope of a plot of signal amplitude versus  time) of a succession of stored signals from any monitor  which would indicate a probable malfunction of a device  being monitored and the probable time to failure.  in the case  where the signals from the monitors comprise vibration  signals, the system performs an automatic frequency spectrum  analysis whenever a probable or actual malfunction is  detected.
