<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for the film-packaging of articles, the latter being laterally offset in relation to the width of the film webs, the film being sealed by sealing means longitudinally and transversely of the articles, comprising a deflector rod which guides the film in semitubular form over the articles and which extends over several article lengths at a slight angle to the direction of movement of the film, and further comprising conveyor belts which are disposed beneath the film and which have suction holes via which a vacuum holds the film on the conveyor belt, characterised in that retaining and guide rollers (12) bear on the deflector rod (7) ; deflector rails (13) are provided to guide the bottom and top edges (14, 15) of the film (1) over one another at the narrow side (at 16, 17) of the articles ; the sealing means (23) for sealing the film edges (14, 15) are disposed laterally adjacent the narrow side (at 16, 17) of the articles as considered in the direction of the film movement ; and at least one suction belt (18) running above the deflected part of the film is disposed in the end zone of the deflector rails (13) in the region of the sealing means (23).
