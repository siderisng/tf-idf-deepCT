<ABSTRACT>
nitrobenzene is combined with at least one mole of so₃,  as 65% oleum, resulting in an exothermic reaction.  the reac­ tants are combined slowly, and/or cooling is supplied, so as  to keep the reaction temperature in the range between about  80° and 130°c.  the resulting sulfonation mass is held at a  temperature between about 80 and 130°c for a sufficiently  long period of time to effect substantial completion of the  sulfonation reaction.  the sulfonation mass is then added to  sufficient caustic soda to convert the acids therein to na₂so₄  and sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate.  at a ph between 7 and  8. 6 and at a temperature between 80° and 100°c, sufficient  water is provided by, or added to, the resulting mass so that  the sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate is dissolved therein and  at least 60% of the na₂so₄ is precipitated, making it possible  to separate the one from the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate this invention relates t, an improved process for preparing sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate by sulfonation of nitrobenzene using oleum. as was noted in british specification 1,030,308, it has been conventional to use a large excess of sulfuric acid or olewm. as a sulfonating agent and a solvent in the sulfonation of nitro-aromatic compounds, resulting in the product being ostained in admixture with a large amount of sulfuric acid. the nitro-aromaticsulfonic acid was isolated from the reaction mixture by reacting the same with lime so as to convert the excess sulfuric acid to calcium sulfate which was removed by filtration. in the alternative, the nitro-aromaticsulfonic acid was isolated by the sodium chloride "salting cut" method. as pointed out in the british specification, the former method is an uneconomic one; large amounts of calcium sulfate are formed which. must te washed with large amounts of water, and then the filtrate must be evaporated so as to recover te product. the "salting out" method has its disadvantages as well, as are further described in the british patent. a process for sulfonating nitro-aromatic compounds, including nitrobenzene,with so3, so as to produce the sodium salt is disclosed in u.s. patent 3,492,342. while the use of so3 as a sulfenating agent avoids the production of large amounts of sulfuric acid, thereby dealing with a recovery problem common to this art, it has disadvantages as well. such sulfonations with so3 are attended by sultone formation, resulting in the consumption of significant quantities of reactants-. mcreover, the s03 has a tendericy to polymerize. it is therefore necessary to supply heat to the equipment being used to dispense the so3 so as to prevent plugging of the equipment by the polymers which are form. in in addition, the presence of a reasonable amount of sulfuric acid can be an advantage il processes for prepara- ing sulfonates such as sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate, because it is insoluble therein. fiat final report no. 1313, dated february 1, 1948, pb 85172, pages 187-191, discloses a method for preparing metanilic acid, starting with nitrobenzene, 98% sulfuric acid and 65% oleum (equivalent to 44% oleum). after the sulfonation reaction was completed, the reaction mass was diluted with water, and sodium sulfate and calcium carbonate ("carbid kalk") were added. assuming that substantially all of the nitrcbenzene was converted to the sulfuric acid, the amount of sodium sulfate provided was insufficient to convert all of it to sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate. according to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate which comprises reacting slightly more than one mole of so3, as 65% oleum, per mole of nitrobenzene at a temperature between 800 and 1300c for a period of time sufficient to effect sulfonation of substantially all of the nitrobenzene; thereafter, at a temperature not higher than 105 c., combining the sulfonation reaction mass with sufficient caustic soda to convert substantially all of the sulfuric acid and the resulting m-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid to na2s04 and sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate; at a ph between 7 and
