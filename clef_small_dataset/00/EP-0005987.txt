<ABSTRACT>
a frangible cartridge for anchoring a reinforcing element  such as a rock-bolt in a borehole in rock strata, for example  an underground mine roof, contains as separate components  (a) a hydraulic substance mixed with a non-aqueous  water-miscible liquid which is inert with respect thereto to  form a paste-like mass and (b) an aqueous liquid, preferably  water, which is capable of reacting with the hydraulic  substance in component a on being brought into contact  therewith when in use a reinforcing element is caused to  break the cartridge and mix together components a and b  within the borehole so as to form a cementitious grout  around the reinforcing element, said grout serving when  hardened to anchor the reinforcing element in the borehole.   this cartridge is safer for use in coal mines and the like than  the conventional resinous cartridges and is more reliable  than cartridges in which the hydraulic substance is present in  a dry form.
