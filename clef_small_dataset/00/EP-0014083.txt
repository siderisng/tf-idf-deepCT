<ABSTRACT>
in the preparation of low molecular weight water soluble  polymers having a molecular weight of up to about 50,000, mo­ nomer comprising (a) at least one of acrylic acid, methacrylic  acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, alkylpolyalkoxyacrylate, al­ kylpolyalkoxy methacrylate, n-vinyl pyrollidone, acryloxypropi­ onic acid, methacrolein and acrolein and optionally from about  5 to 50% by weight of the total monomers present of (b) at  least one of itaconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, hydroxye­ thylmethacrylate, hydroxypropylmethacrylate, hydroxyethylac­ rylate, hydroxypropylacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile,  dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,  t-butylaminoethyl acrylate, 4-vinyl pyridine, beta-hydroxyethyl­ dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate salt and t-butylaminoethyl  methacrylate, is reacted in an aqueous solution system at a  temperature up to the boiling point of said system in the pres­ ence of a catalyst system comprising initiator and metal salt  wherein the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion is from about  10:1 to about 5000:1, preferably from 10:1 to 150:1, and the in­ itiator is present in an amount of from about 0. 5 weight percent  to about 35 weight percent based on the weight of monomer  present.  the catalyst system may also comprise reducing  agent wherein the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion is prefera­ bly from about 150:1 to about 5000:1 and the molar ratio of in­ itiator to reducing agent is from about 0. 5:1 to about 20:1.  po­ lymer prepared by this method, such as polyacrylic acid, may  be used as a scale inhibitor.
