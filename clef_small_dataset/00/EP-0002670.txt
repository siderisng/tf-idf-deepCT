<ABSTRACT>
The inventive method provides a semiconductor structure, which is housed within an embedded oxide insulation zone (12). It consists of a semiconductor substrate (10) of a first conductivity type within which a collector (22) of the opposite line type is formed below the surface of the substrate and can extend to the surface of the substrate for light contacting. A first layer of doped polycrystalline silicon is formed on a first part of the surface of the substrate and in electrical contact with the substrate which acts as a base (29) of a transistor. The first, consisting of polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) layer (30) is oxidized to form an outer overlying insulating layer (32). A second doped polysilicon layer is deflected over the outer insulating layer (32) on a second part of the surface of the substrate in such a way that it has a distance from this, which only by the thickness of the outer insulating layer on the first polysilicon Layer is intended. The dopant in the second polysilicon layer is then driven into the surface of the semiconductor substrate and forms an emitter (33).
