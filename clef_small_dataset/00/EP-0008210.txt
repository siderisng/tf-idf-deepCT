<ABSTRACT>
a crane operating aid has one (or more) absolute en­ coding digital optical sensors (54) for monitoring linear or  angular displacement between portions of the crane which  are operatively moveable with respect to one another.   each sensor (e. g.  54) comprises a detector made up of a  light emitting element (568) which is spaced from a light  receiving element (570) and an encoder disc (560) which  is mounted for displacement with respect to the detector  and operates to present a series of tracks (572)  intermediate the light emitting portion (568) and light re­ ceiving portion (570) of the detector.  each track (572)  comprises a series of alternatingly opaque and transparent  portions (576, 574).  by moving the encoder disc (560) with  respect to the detector, digitally encoded information is im­ parted to the detector representative of the displacement  of the portions of the crane being monitored.  preferably,  the digital output signals from a number of such sensors  which monitor crane parameters such as boom lenght,  boom angle, and slewing angle are fed together with si­ gnals representing boom reaction forces to a load moment  computer which then calculates the percentage of load ca­ pacity as a function of the crane manufacturer's published  load rating tables.
