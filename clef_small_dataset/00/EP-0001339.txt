<ABSTRACT>
a mid-stream urine collection device comprises a flat  open-topped tray-like receptacle (1) having plastics film (2)  wrapped around it under tension with edges secured together  across the open top of the receptacle by an adhesive (4) which  releases the edges when wetted by urine, so that the film then  snaps away from the open top, diverting the first part of the  urine stream from the receptacle and permitting the mid-stream  part to enter.
