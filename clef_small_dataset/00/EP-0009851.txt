<ABSTRACT>
Improvement of a method for producing araliphatic dihydroperoxides of the general formula wherein Ar = aromatic radical and R = H or C₁ -C₄-alkyl, according to which these dihydroperoxides in a known manner of hydrocarbons of the formula wherein R and Ar have the meaning given above, by Oxidation (a) with oxygen-containing gases, extraction (b) of the dihydroperoxides with up to 12% alkali eye, neutralization (C) of the alkali hydroxides remaining in organic raffinate with CO₂ and subsequent washing (C) of the formed alkali carbonates with water become. The improvement is that the hydroperoxide constituents dissolved in the washing water extracted with a hydrocarbon (D) and, optionally, returns to the oxidation process (A). It can previously be separated from the extract the solvent (E) and continue to use. As extraction means, hydrocarbons are used from the group of the aliphren of C₅ to C₈ and aromatics or substituted aromatics. Particularly suitable is the hydrocarbon serving for the preparation of the araliphatic dihydroperoxides.
