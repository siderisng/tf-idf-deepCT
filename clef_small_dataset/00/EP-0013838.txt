<ABSTRACT>
a clip for joining together and thus forming a package of a  plurality of cans having a chime on their upper edge employs a  body supporting a chime-engaging hook (34) at its lower end  and a spaces pair of chime-engaging tabs (44) at its upper end,  all of which cooperate to engage one can chime.  the body is  flexibly hinged (46) between portions (30) dedicated to engage  each can so that the hook and tabs engaging one can are not  deformed by pivotal motion of other cans in the clip.  for great­ est material efficiency each hook (34) engages the chime over  an arc segment, and the the tabs (44) engage the chime over a  non-overlapping arc segment at each end of the segment en­ gaged by the hook.  the tabs extend downwardly against the  inside chime surface to abutment with the can end.  a cover  sheet may be used in association with the clip, and may have a  peripheral skirt protecting the can sides.
