<ABSTRACT>
in a grill of this type, a continuous axle (8), which is at the same time the gas burner, is guided through bore holes in the frame (6, 7) and in the bent edges of the base plate (9).  the front plates (12) are unattached.  the side plates (10, 11), having appropriately provided bent edges, are hooked in.  for grilling using lateral heat, plate (11) lies on top and the double grid (20) stands upright in the incisions (13).  for grilling using upwardly directed heat, both plates (10, 11) are hooked onto the upper strips of the frame and the grid (20) lies opened out on top.  in order to vary the height from the fire to the grid, the frames (6, 7), provided with the height and depth adjuster (16), are spread or contracted by means of joint (17) and the tab with joint and mandrel (18).  the assembled resting axle (15), which is subdivided in the middle, has the function of keeping the base plate (9) with the front plates (12) situated on it horizontal at any height by sliding on the inner frame (7).  after the front plates (12) have been removed and the resting axle (15) has been taken apart, the grill can be collapsed in the manner of scissors.  <image>
