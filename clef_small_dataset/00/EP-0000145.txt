<ABSTRACT>
Optical fiber connector comprising a connecting member (2) provided with axial holding means (10) and axial guide (8) of a precisely known diameter fiber segment (12) with the rear end (46). is connected by welding at the end of a large transmission fiber (68). The connector also comprises an intermediate element (34) ensuring the fastening between the connecting member (2) and a blocking element (60) of the transmission fiber (68) such as the end (46) of the segment of the segment. Fiber (12) is in alignment and in contact with the end of the transmission fiber (68). openings (50) in the intermediate element (34) provide access to the fiber contact area (12.68) and to achieve welding. The realization of a removable optical connection between two transmission optical fibers (68) is done by means of two complementary connectors each comprising a connecting element (2.2 ') provided with the holding means (10.10') d An optical fiber segment (12) in diameter known precisely. Application to telecommunications.
