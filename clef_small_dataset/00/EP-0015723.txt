<ABSTRACT>
a novel operator for use with a damper is disclosed com­ prising a plurality of pivotally interconnected damper operator  members (302, 304) which are pivotally associated with the  damper blade linkage (206, 208) and frame (108), such that  they may be moved to an over-center locking position to lock  the damper blades (102, 104, 106) in their desired fire actuated  positions.  the operator also comprises an actuator means for  selectively acting through the operator to control the degree of  blade opening, and a releasing device for responding to vari­ ous activation conditions, such as heat, for disengaging the  actuator from the operator members to facilitate closure and  automatic locking of the blades (102, 104, 106).  the operator  members may also be springed biased to automatically ac­ complish blade closure.

<DESCRIPTION>
quadrant operator the present invention generally relates to the field of damper operators, and more particularly, damper operators employing releasing devices such as bimetals or other heat responsive means which are used to actuate various fire protection equipment, such as their associated dampers, either in response to increases to heat in the vicinity of the device or in response to remote signals received thereby. the present invention is particularly adapted for use with dampers comprising a frame having one or more rotating blades mounted therein. conventionally, such dampers are provided with blade linkages which articulate the blades with respect to the frame so that the blades will move in unison between their open and closed positions with respect to the frame. it has long been known that such dampers may be operated using cables attached to the blade brackets or blade linkages of these dampers, which cables are normally threaded through a ferrule disposed through the damper/duct wall to reach an operator motor mounted outside of the duct in which the damper is located. it is also known to bias the blades towards the closed position, as for example, using springs extending between the damper frame and the blades, and to provide fusible links in the cable portion located within the duct so that, in response to increased temperatures within the duct, the cable will break and the springs cause the blades to move to the closed position, whereupon the passage of fire through the duct will be halted. similar alternative arrangements have also been used for smoke dampers which are intended to move to the open position in response to the presence of smoke, and the herein below described invention is equally as-applicable for use with such dampers. alternatively, it is known to operate dampers through a damper operator shaft, the rotation of which through an arc of 900 corresponds to the rotation of the damper blades through 900 between their open and closed positions. see, for example, the various damper operators disclosed in my prior issued united states patent no. 4,113,232, dated september 12, 1978, entitled "smoke, fire and air control damper with stamped blade". for other damper, blade linkage, spring biasing, and operator constructions, please refer to the following united states patent nos. 2,581,321; 2,654,921; 2,759,573; 2,996,768; 3,273,632; 3,327,764; 3,540,154; 3,727,663; 3,721,102; 3,814,165; 3,866,656; 3,899,156; 3,908,529; 1,368,453; 3,543,439; and british specification no. 907, dated january 13, 1904 and french patent no. 1,513,298. motorized operators for use in rotating damper operating shafts through an arc of 900 are known. such motorized operators normally may be controlled from a remote source to adjust air flow through the damper by rotating the damper blades a preselected number of degrees from the closed towards the open position, which degrees are normally assumed to correspond to the percentage of air flow through that damper. for example, a 10 movement of the shaft normally corresponds to a 100 opening of the damper which is assumed to establish a corresponding air flow approximately 110
