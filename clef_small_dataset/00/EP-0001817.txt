<ABSTRACT>
In such a developing device, two rotatable, pressed against each other pressed rolls (1, 2), means (10) for exerting an additional force on these, as well as means (10) for uniform application of developer fluid to one of the rollers are provided.In order to transport the diazocopic material by a continuous gap between the rollers wrinkle-free, the means (10) for exerting the additional force, the deflection plane one of the rollers outside the main plane of the roll axes (5, 6) is laid.A first cutting line (18) of the deflection plane with the cladding of this roller from which the deflection to the roll axis (5) is released is before the pass gap (12).The diazotype material (11) is brought between the first section line (18) and the continuous gap (12) on this roller to the support and removed behind the continuous gap (12) in front of the second section line (19) of the deflection plane with the jacket.
