<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for photoelectric scanning of color images (1), in which the scanning of light beams (B1, B2) are evaluated in three or more color filters (21, 22) according to different sensitivity curves. Photoelectric receivers then derive evaluation signals encoding in three color value signals. For such arrangements, a possible simplicity, economical and space-saving construction is sought. The invention releases this problem with linear CTD image sensors (4,4 ') which are aligned on one and the same line of the color image (1). The pixels of at least one image sensor (4 ') are divided into two or more PARP, which are color filters (22) of different, group-specific evaluation curves and group-specific CCD's, on the outputs (40b', 40c ') separated evaluation signals occur. The scope of the invention comprises in particular color film scanner in which a television screen serves as a playback device.
