<ABSTRACT>
method characterized by the fact that one removes over a certain length from the end of the fiber, the outer sheath (3) of mechanical protection, which is put on the fiber in a connector tip (4) ofmanner that part of the poor fiber of its outer sheath is contained in the connector tip, the remaining portion of the poor fiber of its external sheath protruding from the front end (5) of the connector tip,It is then solidarized, in particular by crimping, the connector tip of the fiber in its part always provided with the outer sheath, then that one cuts the portion of the destitute fiber of its outer sheath in the vicinity of the'Exurgy before the connector tip.Application in particular at the connection of mono fibers optical index jump.
