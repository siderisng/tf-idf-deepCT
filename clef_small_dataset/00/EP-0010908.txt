<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus includes a reciprocating cardiac com­ pressor (10) for cyclically compressing a patient's chest.   the cardiac compressor includes a resuscitator for venti­ lating the patient's lungs.  a first internal electrode (60) is  positioned in the oesophagus of the patient with an oeso­ phageal-pharyngeal airway.  the resuscitator ventilates the  patient's lungs through the oesophageal-pharyngeal airway.   the cardiac compressor includes a compressor pad (17)  positioned anterior to the patient's heart (45) for compress­ ing the patient's sternum and heart.  an external electrode  (48) is disposed on the face of the compressor pad for  compression between the compressor pad and the pa­ tient's sternum (46).  a cardiac defibrillator (100) is connec­ ted between external and internal electrodes for establish­ ing a defibrillating electric current therebetween.  a monitor  (101) is connected to the external and internal electrodes  for monitoring the electrical activity of the patient's heart.   means for synchronising the defibrillator and the compres­ sor is provided comprising a pressure sensitive switch for  synchronising the defibrillator and compressor such that  defibrillating current is applied to the patient's heart only  during a systolic portion of the compression cycle of the  compressor, i. e.  when the path between the internal and  external electrodes is short and electrical contact between  the electrodes and adjacent parts of the body is good.
