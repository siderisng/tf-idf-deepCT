<ABSTRACT>
the base of a bin (1) has two guides for the forks (9) of a  fork lift truck.  each guide has a forward channel member (5)  attached to the bin (1) and a rear tubular or partially closed  member (6) pivotally connected to the channel member (5)  by means of a pivot (8) which is aligned with the pivot (8) of  the other guide (5 and 6).  when the forks (9) are inserted into the guides, the forÂ­ ward and rear members (5 and 6) are held in alignment.  to  allow the bin (2) to tip, the bin (1) is rested and the forks (9)  are partially withdrawn from the guides (5 and 6) so that they  extend through the rear members (6), but are clear of the  forward members (5).  then, on further lifting of the forks (9),  the guides hinge about the pivots (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a tipping device and more particularly. to a tipping device to allow tipping of a bin, pallet or other load supporting device adapted to be handled by the forks of a fork-lift truck. many goods, loads and materials are handled by a fork-lift truck, either by being in a bin, or on a pallet or the like. where material is carried by a bin it is desirable to be able to tip the bin into another container or bulk transport vehicle or the like. many bins are transported by a fork-lift truck, and in order to empty the bin, a special vehicle is provided, for example a transport vehicle is provided with forks which lift and tip the bin into a container carried by a transport vehicle. however, this vehicle can only empty the bins into its own container. thus it is an object of this invention to provide a device which is operable to allow tipping of a bin or pallet or the like supported on the forks of a fork-lift truck. it is a further object of this invention to provide a tipping device for a bin or pallet or the like, in which the tipping is controlled by the operation of the fork-lift truck in an automatic or semi-automatic manner. thus there is provided according to the invention a bin or pallet which is pivoted to a base portion which is adapted to be supported by the forks of a fork-lift truck, whereby the bin or pallet can pivot relative to this base portion. in order to more fully understand the invention description will now be made of a preferred form of the invention utilizing a bin adapted to be carried and supported by the forks of a fork-lift truck, it being realized that instead of the bin there could be just a platform tray or pallet like structure which would operate in the same manner. in the drawings: fig. 1 shows the bin in the loading position, fig. 2 shows the bin in the tipping position, and fig. 3 shows the bin formed as a scoop. in the preferred form of the invention bin 1 is provided with a base 2 having guides or slots therein for the reception of the forks of a fork-lift truck. the base 2 is divided into two portions, a forward portion 3 and a rear portion 4. the forward portion 3 is situated on the bin on the forward side of the bin, that is remote from the fork-lift truck. pivoted to this forward portion 3 there. is a rear base portion 4 also having guides and slots for the reception of the forks, preferably the pivot being generally centrally of the bin. the forward portion 3 can comprise a pair of channel members 5 fixed to the base of the bin 1. the rear portion 4 comprises a pair of square tubular or partially closed members 6 braced by cross members 7 to form the

<CLAIMS>
     emi8.1         claims    1. a tipping bin for use with a fork-lift truck, said bin having a base adapted to receive the forks of a fork-lift truck, a portion of said base pivoting relative to said bin so that with the forks engaged in said portion, the bin may pivot relative   thereto,    characterized in that said base is divided into a forward portion and a rear portion povited to each other with said bin being attached to said forward portion, said portions having means to receive the forks with the forks passing firstly through said rear portion to pass into the forward portion, so that by withdrawing the forks from the forward portion into the rear portion the bin is adapted to tip forwardly.     2. a.tipping bin as defined in claim   1,    characterized in that said rear portion of the base is provided with rectangular tubular members adapted to receive the forks of the fork lift truck, and the forward protions are downwardly open channel shaped members in line with the tubular members.      3.    3. a tipping bin as defined in claim   j    further characterized in that a chain is provided to anchor the rear base portion to the fork-lift truck to prevent the forks from being inadvertently withdrawn.
