<ABSTRACT>
a two-stage process for the production of linear phos­ phonitrilic chloride oligomers is provided.  in the first step,  phosphorus trichloride (pcl₃) and chlorine are reacted in a  suitable liquid reaction medium.  in the second step pcl₃, cl₂  and nh₃ are concurrently fed into the medium while maintain­ ing a temperature at 100°c to 140°c.  the feeds of the reactants  are controlled so that until the first half of the nh₃ has been  reacted the molar ratio of pcl₃:nh₃ (including the pcl₃ of the  first step) is kept above two.  thereafter, the feeds are adjusted  so that with respect to the total amount of ammonia, said  molar ratio is between 1. 2 and 1. 5.  linear phosphonitrilic  chloride oligomers having a number average degree of  polymerization from 2 to 9 are produced in high yield.
