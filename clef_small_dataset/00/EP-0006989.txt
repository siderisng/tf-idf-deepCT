<ABSTRACT>
a hot gas measuring device comprising a tube (28) made  of solid electrolyte material is slideably mounted within a  ceramic support tube (24) which is mounted to project into the  interior of a furnace.  the end of the electrolyte tube (28) is  closed and the support tube (24) has open ports (26) or win­ dows therein which expose the exterior end surface of the  electrolyte tube (28) to the hot furnace gases and causes a  voltage to develop between the interior and the exterior sur­ faces of the electrolyte tube (28) which is indicative of a fur­ nace gas characteristic.  a first electrode (36) is supported  between the ends of the electrolyte tube (28) and the support  tube (24), and a second electrode (38) is supported within the  inner end of the electrolyte tube (28).  to prolong the life of the  electrode (36) it is preferably made either of mtiltiple layers of  noble metal wire screens mounted in face-to-face relation­ ship, a chemically stable electronic ceramic conductor such as  cation-doped lanthanum chromite, or a noble metal screen  coated with an electronic conducting ceramic cement

<DESCRIPTION>
hot gas measuring device this invention relates to the measurement of gas characteristics through the use of a probe com- prising a solid electrolyte which is in contact on one side or face with a reference gas such as the ambient atmosphere and is in contact on the opposing side or face with a hot gas whose characteristics are to b measured. in such a probe, a voltage is generated be- tween the two sides or faces of the solid electrolyte, the magnitude of the voltage being dependent upon the temperature of the electrolyte and on the ratio of the oxygen partial pressure on opposing sides or faces of the electrolyte. this principle has bee used in the past to measure the oxygen partial pressure of hot furnace gases with various different oxygen sensors, such as disclosed in u.s. patents 3,454,486; 3,546,086 and 3,597,345 and british patent 1,296,995. although the principle of operation of tha above-noted type of oxygen sensors is quite simple, the utili¯ation of such oxygen sensors in industrial applications has been limited iii the past due to several practical problems. first, the solid electrolyte, which is a ceramic material, is hard and brittle and is thus very susceptible to thermal should and/or mechanical damage. another problem has been the de tachnient of the electrode from the surface of the electrolyte due to corrosion of the electrodes. the latter problem occurs even when the electrodes are made of a noble metal, such as platinum. for example, platinum reacts at high temperatures and low oxygen pressures with stabilized zirconia electrolyte material, which is commonly used in this type of oxygen sensor to form zrft3. the reaction product is in the form of fragments or dust which drops away from the electrode, thus reducing the thickness thereof and eventually breaking the electrical contact between the electrode and the electrolyte or loosening the electrode sufficiently in its mounting to allow it to be blown away by the gas stream under measurement. the life of prior art electrodes is substantially reduced when used in a highly corrosive atmosphere typically present in some heat treating furnaces. for the above reasons, the useful working life of the above-noted type of oxygen sensor has been limited in the past and has limited their potential range of application. the use of an electronic ceramic coating is disclosed in patent re. 28,792. this patent discloses (col. 6, lines 19-66) an electrode for a fuel cell using an electronic conducting porous metal oxide coating. however, the type of electrode disclosed in patent re. 28,792 requires that the electrodes 12 and 14 which are applied directly to the electrolyte be porous so that gas can readily diffuse through tho electrodes to the electrolyte interface 10 (re. 28,792, col. 3, lines 48-68; col. 4, lines 1-8). this arrange ment requires a somewhat critical and loa contact re sistane (col. 6, lines 19-20) for effective operation. inasniuch as the present invention is an open circuit sensor, -the contact resistance is not
