<ABSTRACT>
In a mixing head, in whose mixing chamber are mixed together at least two plastic components, the mixing phase and the nonmixing phase - at the latter, the plastic components are routed unmixed from the mixing head - controlled by an at least one overflow channel (49.50) per plastic component having control piston (34) controlled.In order for the plastic components to be mixed with each other in the region between the overflow channels (49, 50), the wall (32) of the housing (34) receiving the control piston (34) receiving housing (31) is elastically formed and causes a stronger and thus at least in this areaSealing seat between the control piston (34) and the wall (32) results.The pressing force of the wall (32) is possibly controllable.
