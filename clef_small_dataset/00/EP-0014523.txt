<ABSTRACT>
a component of a polymerisation catalyst is prepared by  reacting an organo-magnesium compound, or a complex  with an organo-aluminium compound, with a solid, inorganic  oxide, then with a halogenating agent such as silicon tetrach­ loride or hydrogen chloride, and then reacting the product  with a lewis base compound, particularly an ester and finally  with titanium tetrachloride.  the product obtained is com­ bined with an organo-aluminium compound, preferably  together with a lewis base, and used to polymerise an olefin  monomer particularly propylene or mixtures of ethylene and  a i-olefin containing at least 4 carbon atoms.  the catalyst  system has a high activity, is stereospecific and has a lower  proportion of halogen than some other catalyst systems.
