<ABSTRACT>
a rotatable sleeve (20) for guiding at least one strand of  wire (39), for example, includes a tubular outer member (21)  bonded to a tubular, dimensionally stable inner member (22)  which is press fitted onto a rotatable shaft (e. g.  36).  dimensional  stability is imparted from the inner member (22) to the  outer member (21) which undergoes radial stress from the  wire strand (39).  for spacing a plurality of wire strands at a  predetermined distance from one another, grooves (24) are  machined into the outer member (21) of the rotatable sleeve  (20).  a further feature provides another tubular member (23)  inside the inner member (22) for optimizing the press fit of the  rotatable sleeve (20) to the shaft (36).
