<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a process for preparing 2′-hydroxy-2′- desamino-4,6-di-o-(aminoglycosyl)  -1,3-diaminocyclitols having a 6′-amino function and pharmaceutically  acceptable acid addition salts thereof, to novel  compounds and salts obtained by this process; and to novel  antibacterially active compositions comprising such novel  compounds or salts.  the process comprises reacting the corresponding  n-protected (except the 2′-amino)-4,6-di-o- (aminoglycosyl)-1,3,-diaminocyclitol  with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of  tungstate ion, followed by cleavage of the thereby formed  2′-oximino derivative and by reduction of the resulting 2′-oxo  derivative and by removal of the n-protecting groups.  the preferred group of novel compounds obtained by  this process are the 1-n- (ω-amino-α- hydroxyalkanoyl)  -2′-hydroxy-2′- desamino-4,6-di-o- (aminoglycosyl)- 1,3-diaminocyclitols.   the compounds obtained by the process of  this invention exhibit antibacterial activity
