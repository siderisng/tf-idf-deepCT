<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for ion-selective electrode measurements and  a method of standardizing the same wherein the sample  liquid is diverted in a standardization mode from the flow cell  10 to a heat exchanger 42.  reference solution is passed from a  reservoir 36 to the flow cell via the heat exchanger so that  standardization can be carried out with flowing reference solÂ­ ution which is at the same temperature as the sample.  one  application lies in continuous ph monitoring of boiler feed  water.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for use in ion-selective electrode measurements this invention relates to ion-selective electrode measurements and is particularly applicable to the continuous monitoring of ph levels of, for example, boiler feed water. apparatus for this purpose, has hitherto typically comprised a flow cell through which a sample of the boiler feed water is directed, the flow cell having mounted therein a ph sensor consisting, for example, of a glass electrode and a reference electrode. at perodic intervals it is necessary to standardize the apparatus with the use of a reference solution of known ph, and in many systems this involves removing the electrodes from the flow cell and placing them in the vessel containing reference solution. this practice is clearly time-consuming, but it also introduces significant errors since a standardization is carried out in an environment which differs considerably, particularly in temperature, frozen that obtaining in the flow cell during ph measurement. the problem of achieving reliable yet rapid standard ization has been partially overcome in one proposal which provides an inlet in the apparatus for pouring reference solution directly into the flow cell. this procedure has the advantage that the electrodes are not removed from the flow cell, but there remains the risk that as a result of temperature differences between the reference solution and sample water, the apparatus may be incorrectly standardized. in addition, it is necessary with this procedure for the flow cell to be thoroughly rinsed with distilled water after it has been drained of sample water and before it is filled with reference solution; this is a time consuming exercise. a further disadvantage is that whilst ph measurements are taken with the sample water flowing through the flow cell, standardization is carried out with reference solution which has been poured into the flow cell and is not flowing through the cell. this is a further possible source of error. it is an object of this invention to provide apparatus for the ion-selective electrode measurement of sample liquid which may be standardized simply and quickly and in which the errors of standardization due to variations in temperature are significantly reduced if not removed. it is a further object of the invention to provide an improved method of standardizing a ion-selective electrode sensor. accordingly, the present invention consists, in one aspect, in apparatus for the ion-selective electrode measurement of sample liquid, comprising a flow cell having an ionselective electrode assembly mounted therein; a reference solution reservoir; means including a heat exchanger connecting the reservoir with the flow cell and sample conduit means provided with a flow selector whereby sample liquid may be directed in a measuring mode through the flow cell and in a standardization mode through the heat exchanger, the passage of reference solution through the heat exchanger in the standardization mode thereby serving to equilibrate sample liquid and reference solution temperatures. in one form of the invention, the ion-selective electrode assembly comprises a ph electrode and a reference electrode. in another aspect, this invention
