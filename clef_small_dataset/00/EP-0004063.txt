<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for producing clad plate or sheet, in particular clad plate having a thickness of 100 to 300 mm, by roll-bond cladding an evacuated one-die or two-side cladding package formed by a base material and a cladding material in a sandwich-like manner, the cladding package being sealed on all sides by a welding frame (6) and the base-material plate(s) (1) and the cladding-material plate(s) (2), on the sides getting into contact with each other, being machine, preferably plane-machined by planing or belt-grinding, characterized by the combination of the following measures : - that prior to the welding of the cladding package an auxiliary frame (4) peripherally surrouding the cladding-material plate(s) (2) is used which has a height that corresponds approximately to the height of the superposed cladding-material plates (2) in case of the two-side cladding package or to the cladding-material plate (2) in case of the one-side cladding package, - that an air gap (7) is kept free between the welding frame (6) and the auxiliary frame (4), and - that the roll-bonding step is carried out by applying a total-deformation degree of less than 50 %, preferably of less than 30 %, in five rolling passes at the most.
