<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for continuous welding of large sheets, wherein after execution of the first welding rape (I), the button (27) released onto the other side (30) of the stem ice cream (20) and thereby pulled the blower lamp (28) and during the displacement the Width (s) of the stem ice cream (20) is measured, DAM is compared with the measured width (S) with stored width (S1, S2, S3) and decided how many more caterpillars must be deposited on this layer, then the same time a second caterpillar (ii) with the button (27) and the terminal blade lamp (28), on the other side (30) of the stem ice plate (20) is carried out, then the button (27) moved in the transverse direction for connection to the same distance of the crawler width will, whereby this displacement by reproducing a same reverse reflection gung the blade lamp (28), which is arranged at a distance from the pushbutton which is the crawler width and then a third performed on the second caterpillar (III) and thus continued for the predetermined caterpillar number (s) and the button (27) and the blade lamp (28) are returned to their initial position on the first side (29) to a new welding layer Off.
