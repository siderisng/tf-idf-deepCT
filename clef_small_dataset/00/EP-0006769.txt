<ABSTRACT>
an electromagnetic valve (10) for controlling fluid flow  comprises a magnetic spherical valve member (20) mov­ ably disposed in a fluid chamber (f₁, f₂) to which fluid is  admitted, a non-magnetic valve seat member (22) on which  the spherical valve member (20) is seatable, a main magne­ tic pole member (28a) disposed opposite the valve seat  member (22) and in close proximity to the spherical valve  member (20) to attract the valve member thereto, and a side  magnetic pole member (p) disposed around the spherical  valve member (20) and in close proximity to the valve mem­ ber, the side magnetic pole member (p) being spaced from  and between the level of the extreme end of the main ma­ gnetic pole member (28a) and the level of the extreme end  of the valve seat member (22), so that a magnetic field formed  between the main and side magnetic pole members (28a, p)  effectively acts on the spherical valve member (20) so as  to shorten the response time and stability in the action of  the electromagnetic valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
"eiectromagnegic valve for fluid flow controti" this invention relates to an electromagnetic valve for controlling the amount of a fluid flow, and more particularly to an improvement of such an electromagnetic valve for controlling the amount of fuel flow supplied to an internal combustion engine used in automotive vehicle. in connec-cn with an electronically controlled fuel injection system for supplying sprayed fuel into the combustion chambers of an internal combustion engine, it is well knows that - fuel injectcr of the fuel invention system is provided with an electromagnetic valve continuously repeating the opening and closing operation to control the flow amount of the fuel to be injected. such an electromagnetic valve is composed of a valve member which is elongate in its direction of movement and slidable in an elongate guide member, and requires to be produced by high precision machining, for the purpose of maintaining an adequate fluid seal between the valve member and the guide member. there has also been proposed an electromagnetic valve of the type wherein a spherical valve member seatable on a valve seat is used to control the flow amount of fuel supplied to an engine, the electromagnetic valve of this type has a significant advantage in that an adequate fluid seal can be maintained even if the valve seat is produced by press working. therefore, such an electromagnetic valve does not require high precision machining and accordingly is advantageous in this regard as compared with the electromagnetic valve of the type using the elongate valve member slidably disposed in the elongate guide member. however, even such an electromagnetic valve using the spherical valve member encounters the following problems: the magnetic poles are not located such that the magnetic field formed by the magnetic poles effectively acts on the spherical valve member. consequently, the electromagnetic valve of this type has a defect in that the response time becomes prolonged to reduce the response characteristics. additionally, the biasing force of a spring biasing the spherical valve member does not always act vertically or in the direction of the valve seat and accordingly the valve member unavoidably moves laterally te cause unstable opening and closing action of the valve member, contributing to the reduction in high precision control of the amount of fuel flow. the present invention contemplates overcoming problems enco=ntered in conventional and already proposed electromagnetic valves, by locating a side magnetic pole on which the magnetic force of a main magnetic pole is concentrated, n close proximity to a spherical valve member as far as possible within a range in which the spherical valve member never contacts the side magnetic pole even whe moved in the direction thereof. it is a main object of the present invention to provide an improved electromagnetic valve which is high in the response characteristics and stability in opening and closing action as compared with various conventional and already proposed electromagnetic valves, making possible high frequency opening and closing and improving the durability of the electromagnetic valve. it
