<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector (2) having an electric contact  (3) engageable with a terminal (7) by moving the connector  (2) in a forward direction into engagement with the terminal  (7), a forwardly-projecting resilient cantilever finger (8)  having a rear facing shoulder (14) for latching engagement  with an oppositely facing rigid shoulder on the terminal (7),  the free-end of the finger (8) having an extension (12) for  engagement for unlatching the connector (2) from the  terminal (7) by flexing the finger (8) to release the latching  engagement, and a housing (16) with a formation (17) so  shaped that when the housing (16) moves in the rearward  direction with respect to the contact (3) the formation (17)  will engage the extension (12) of the finger (8) to release  the latching engagement, allowing the connector (2) to be  removed from the terminal (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
electrical corrector this invention relates to electrical connectors which can be removed from a terminal by applying a small force when required but resist pulling on the cable or other conductor connected to the contact of the connector. connectors of this type are known in which the connector includes a forwardly-projecting resilient cantilever finger having a rear facing shoulder for latching engagement with an oppositely facing rigid shoulder on the terminal, the free-end of the finger having an extension for engagement with a suitable tool for unlatching the connector for the terminal. this type of connector is described in uf. patent specification 1o8ol2o. an alternative form of knawn connector as described in uk patent specification no. 1463751 has a rearwardly projecting resilient cantilever finger. this connector latches to a terminal in a similar manner to the previous connector, but is released by depressing the free-end of the finger, preferably by pulling the connector housing. both these connectors have disadvantages, the first connector requires the use of a special tool to release the connector from a terminal. the second connector has the disadvantage that the extension of the finger needs to be a considerable distance from the rear-facing shoulder on the finger, and hence the free-end of the finger has to be depressed a considerable amount in order to release the latching engagement of the rear-facing shoulder with the terminal. according to the invention an electrical connector comprises an electric contact engageable with a terminal by moving the connector in a forward direction into engagement with the terminal, a resilient cantilever finger having a rear-facir# shoulder for latching engagement with an oppositely facing rigid shoulder on the terminal, the free-end of the finger having an extension for engagement for unlatching the connector from the terminal by flexing the finger to release the latching engagement, and a housing having a formation so shaped that when the housing moves in the rearward direction with respect to the contact the formation will engage the extension of the finger to release the latching engagement, allowing the connector to be removed from the terminal characterised in that the finger projects forwardly0 preferably the extension of the finger 2/our the engaging formation on the housing has a flat surface oblique to the mating axis for. engaging the other. the invention also includes a two-part electrical coupling comprising the connector described and a terminal having a forwardly facing rigid shoulder for engagement with it in the manner described. preferably the cantilever finger of the connector is so shaped that when the connector is engaged with the terminal, the terminal abuts 5 patt of the finder to inhibit further relative movement. this invention does not require the use of a special unlatching too, and the rear-facing shoulder on the cantilever finger can be positioned agnacent the extension of the finger so that a small amount of movement of the 'free-end of the finger will release the latching engagement of the rear-facing shoulder with the terminal. preferably the contact and
