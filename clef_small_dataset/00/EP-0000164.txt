<ABSTRACT>
electrical flat fuse, which is very light and requires very little space.  it can be configured as a multiple fuse, requires little raw material for its production and is intended to be used, in particular, in motor vehicle electrical systems.  it consists of a plastic part (1) and a fuse element (2), of a stamped-sheet part with a fusing web (4) and two contacting flat bodies, the fuse element being held, locked in a positive manner, in the plastic part.  the plastic part is a plastic frame having frame limbs (13, 14) in which at least one fuse element, consisting of a fusing web and two contacting flat hollow bodies, is held in a positive manner with the flat hollow bodies in the frame limbs.  the contacting flat hollow body of the flat fuse is thus held freely in the plastic part and is nevertheless protected against overbending.  <image>
