<ABSTRACT>
1.  an assembly for pastry making comprising a pastry making plate including a plurality of moulds (2) arranged in a uniform, repeated and modular manner, integrated means (9) for cutting out a main flan of paste placed on the plate (1) in front of each mould (2) for constituting individual and distinct flans of past for each mould (2) by pressing means, said means (9) being constituted by free end edges of flanges (4) of the moulds (2) forming a sharp edge projecting from the upper surface (6a) of the rigid support (6) placed between the moulds (2) ; integrated means (10) permitting the easy removal of the surplus of paste cut out between the individual flans and outside the moulds (2), defined by the concave shape of the upper face (6a) of the support (6) ; driving means (11) cooperating with the plate during baking and adapted to be introduced with the plate in an oven, said driving means (11) ensuring a transmission of heat to the paste by conduction characterized in that the plurality of moulds (2) constitutes a single-piece structure of cast aluminium and the driving means (11) are constituted by at least one rigid single-piece assembly (15) of cast aluminium comprising a rigid support (16), a plurality of bars (17) fixed to the support (16) and a plurality of dies (13) fixed to the end of the bars (17) and arranged in a uniform, repeated and modular manner, this arrangement corresponding to the arrangement of the moulds (2) so that the dies (13) can be disposed in the moulds (2) while defining in the latter free spaces (14), said driving means (11) bearing freely on the individual flans of paste in the course of the baking and applying a load on the flans by their weight while undergoing an upward displacement under the effect of the increase in the thickness of the flans of paste during the baking.
