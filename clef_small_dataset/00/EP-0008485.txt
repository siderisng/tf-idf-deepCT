<ABSTRACT>
a stable water-soluble desorbate instant tea having a  flavor, aroma, appearance and chemical composition approx­ imating that of fresh expertly brewed tea is made by a process  comprising passing steam at reduced pressures through a  columnar bed of ground tea leaves to pre-wet and pre-swell  an upper portion of said leaves; and then passing water and  wet steam at reduced pressures and low temperatures  through said bed to desorb and extract from said tea leaves an  aqueous tea extract while maintaining a weight ratio of said  extract to dry tea leaves of from about 0. 5:1 to about 3:1, and  collecting said extract in a cold trap.  decreaming of the extract  prepared by this process is not necessary to provide a water-­ soluble dry instant tea which, upon reconstitution in water,  provides an iced beverage that tastes like an iced tea made  from fresh, expertly brewed tea.  the solubility and solution  stability of the desorbate tea of this invention are surprisingly  improved by treating the process water with a minor amount  of a higher chain polyphosphate glass, a bilsulfite, a sulfite  and/or a suitable carrageenan.
