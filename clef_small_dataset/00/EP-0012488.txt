<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a process for the preparation  of calcium sulphate hemihydrate in which calcium sulphate  dihydrate is converted with the aid of sulphuric acid.  the conversion is performed in an environment with a  sulphuric acid concentration of more than 25 wt.  % and in  the presence of one or more tetravalent metallic comÂ­ pounds.  with this process the conversion proceeds practically  quantatively yielding a calcium sulphate hemihydrate which  is suitable for the production of building elements, while  the remaining recrystallization acid can be applied for  various industrial purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for the preparation of calcium sulphate hemihydrate and calcium sulphate hemihydrate obtained by this process the invention relates to a process for the preparation of calcium sulphate hemihydrate from calcium sulphate dihydrate and sulphuric acid. a process of this type is known from british patent specification 1,101,771. in the process according to said patent specification calcium sulphate dihydrate is converted into calcium sulphate hemidrate with the aid of a boiling, diluted sulphuric acid solution. a disadvantage of this process is that the mixture of gypsum and diluted sulphuric acid is to be heated to its boiling point. furthermore, it appears to be necessary to add a quantity of previously prepared seeding material to this mixture in order to have the conversion proceed at a sufficient rate. the sulphuric acid required for the recrystallization is to be strongly diluted, as otherwise a conversion into calcium sulphate anhydrite will occur. this diluted sulphuric acid, which is diluted ever further by the crystal water from the calcium sulphate dihydrate, can be used a number of times by concentrating it, but must then be replaced by fresh acid. the diluted waste acid has virtually no technical applications. the aim of the present invention is to provide a process that does not have the disadvantages of the known process. according to the invention this is accomplished by performing the recrystallization of the calcium sulphate dihydrate in an environment with an h2s04 concentration of more than 25 wt. % in the presence of at least one tetravalent metallic compound. by application of this process it appears to be possible to have the recrystallization of the calcium sulphate dihydrate into calcium sulphate hemihydrate proceeds practically quantatively, without having to heat the mixture to its boiling point, while it is not necessary to add seeding crystals, either. furthermore, the rather concentrated recrystallization acid is suitable for other industrial purposes. the tetravalent metallic compounds that can be applied include tetravalent tin, lead and/or zirconium compounds, for instance salts, such as nitrate, chloride, fluoride, sulphate, or a compound that reacts in situ with sulphuric acid to form sulphate. the quantity of metallic compound can vary within broad limits, e.g. from 0.01 to 1 wt. % calculated as metal in relation to the entire recrystallization mixture. a larger quantity of metallic compound can be applied without objections, but this has no additional advantages. by preference a quantity of 0.02-0.2 wt. %, calculated as metal in relation to the entire mixture, is applied. the metallic compound can be added in solid, liquid or dissolved form. the metallic compound can be added to the calcium sulphate dihydrate to be recrystallized, or to the sulphuric acid, or to the recrystallization mixture. the recrystallization temperature may vary, e.g. from 40 to 80 oc, depending on the acid concentration. at a temperature below 40 c the recrystallization proceeds very slowly, while at a temperature above 80 oc the formation of calcium sulphate anhydrite increases. preferably a temperature between 50 and 70 c is chosen. the
