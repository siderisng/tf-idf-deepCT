<ABSTRACT>
styrenes such as methylstyrene and dimethylstyrene  have been produced by the gas-phase catalytic decomposi­ tion at an elevated temperature of 1,1-diarylethanes.  in  accordance with the invention the decomposition is  effected at 300° to 700°c using zeolite as a catalyst.  the use  of a zeolite catalyst provides greater conversions of the 1,1-­ diarylethanes and improved selectivity to the desired sty­ rene.

<DESCRIPTION>
description process for producing styrenes the present invention relates to a process for producing styrene or nucleus-substituted styrenes by the catalytic decomposition of l,l-diarylethanes in gaseous phase. styrene and nucleus-substituted styrenes are very useful as intermediates for production of plastics and fine chemicals such as agricultural chemicals. it is well known that the styrene and nucleussubstituted styrenes are produced by catalytically decomposing l,l-diarylethanes at 3500c to 6000c in the presence of a solid catalyst such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina or kaolin (j.k. dixon and k.w. saunders : i. e. c., 46, no. 4, 652), or by decomposing l,l-diarylethanes at 3500c to 6000c in the presence of silica gel with continuous addition of hydrogen chloride gas or its aqueous solution (published examined japanese patent application no. 28499/1974). as a result of the examination of these well-known methods, however, the followings were found by the present inventors : in carrying out the decomposition of l,l-ditolylethane using silica-alumina as catalyst, when a conversion of l,l-ditolylethane is 60 to 80 %, the selectivity of p-methylstyrene is as low as 40 to 60 %, and p-ethyltoluene which is a hydrdgenated product of p-methylstyrene, is produced as by-product in an amount as much as 30 to 40 %; and in carrying out the decomposition of l,l-ditolylethane using silica gel and hydrogen chloride in combination, when a conversion of l,l-ditolylethane is 50 to 70 %, the selectivity of pmethylstyrene is 25 to 35 % and the amount of ethyltoluene, a by-product, is as low as 3 % but considerable amounts of p-methylstyrene polymer are produced. the present inventors extensively studied to improve these well-known methods, and found that zeolite is very superior as a catalyst for decomposition of 1,1diarylethane. the present invention is to provide a process for producing a styrene of the formula (ii) and/or (iii) emi2.1 wherein r1 to r6 are each a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, which comprises subjecting a l,l-diarylethane of the formula (i), emi2.2 wherein r1 to r6 are as defined above, to gas-phase catalytic decomposition at a temperature of 3000c to 7000c in the presence of zeolite as a catalyst. the or present invention will be illustrated in more detail hereinafter. l,l-diarylethanes used as a starting material in the present invention include for example l,l-diphenylethane, l-phenyl-l-tolylethane, l-phenyl-l-xylylethane, l-phenyl-l-trimethylphenylethane, l,l-ditolylethane, 1tolyl-l-xylylethane, l-tolyl-l-trimethylphenylethane, 1,1dixylylethane, l-xylyl-l-trimethylphenylethane and l,l-bis (trimethylphenyl)ethane. of these, l,l-ditolylethane and l,l-dixylylethane are particularly effectively applied for the catalytic decomposition in accordance with the present invention. the l,l-diarylethane may be synthesized by any method. for example, it can be synthesized by reacting an aromatic compound with acetaldehyde or styrenes at low temperatures with sulfuric acid as catalyst, or by reacting an aromatic compound with acetylene with mercury sulfate and conc. sulfuric acid as catalyst. preferred zeolite used as the catalyst in the present invention'is such that the diameter of pores is 5 to 15 and the molar ratio of sio2 to a1203 is 0.5 to 400:1, particularly preferably 1 to 300:1. when the molar ratio of sio2 to a1203 is
