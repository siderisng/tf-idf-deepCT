<ABSTRACT>
a rack (12,14) for burnishing toothed gears (16) is  disclosed as having an elongated body of a multiple section  construction that provides accentuated axial crowns to gear  teeth (46) burnished by the rack (12,14).  leading and trailing  sections (36,38) of the rack each have a tooth forming face  (44) that provides the rotary support for the gear (16) and the  burnishing of the gear teeth (46) as the gear (16) rotates  between a cooperative pair of the racks (12,14).  one of the  toothed forming faces (44), preferably the trailing one (38), is  slightly inclined with respect to the other rack section (36) in  a lateral direction along the elongated length of the body so  as to provide the accentuated axial crowns on the burnished  gear teeth (46).  both the leading and trailing rack sections  (36,38) are preferably mounted on a base (40) that interconÂ­ nects the rack sections (36,38).  one preferred embodiment  has a unitary trailing rack section (38) whose toothed  forming face (44) is inclined in a single direction, while  another preferred embodiment has a trailing rack section  (38) of a two-piece construction with the toothed forming  face (44) thereof having a shallow v shape.
