<ABSTRACT>
The cutting unit is arranged by means of a horizontal supporters (10) along a longitudinal guide (4) slidably. A vertical supporter (9) connected to a dividing sheet housing (5) is displaceable in the horizontal support (10) and allows lifting of the motor-driven separation sheet (16) from the cutting gut (15). For precise horizontal movement of the cutting unit, a bottom of the separating leaf housing (5) and in a cututut (18) led separation tongue (17) is additionally provided. During the cutting operation, the cutting gut (15) lying on a non-slip pad (19) is pressed by the weight of the cutting unit. From a container (28) via an air intake opening (25) in the separating sheet housing (5) to the particle sheet (16) lubricant is supplied. The chips resulting in the separation process are sucked together with the spent lubricant via a collecting channel (24) in the separating sheet housing (5) via a discharge line (30, 31).
