<ABSTRACT>
For cleaning calcium-containing organically loaded wastewater, in particular for cleaning wastewater from sugar factories, a corresponding wastewater is treated by means of a livestock method with a ventilation with almost pure oxygen and / or with an oxygen-containing gas. In this case, at least temporarily and at least in a portion of the revocation system, a CO₂-containing gas is introduced into the liquid present in the duration system, and in these so many CO₂ content is achieved that a portion of the calcium dissolved in the waste water is precipitated as precipitate. The introduction of the CO₂-containing gas can be carried out in the measure that the pH in the disabilities system set to a value between 6 and 8, in particular between 6.5 and 7.5, and the concentration of activated slide dry substance over 8 kg / m³ and The proportion of the organic substance is defined as a glow loss, is held to 30 to 70%, preferably 40 to 60%.
