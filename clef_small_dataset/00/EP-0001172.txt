<ABSTRACT>
when classifying heterogeneous solids by passing them  over a disc screen (4) formed by a number of rollers (6) rotating  about parallel axes disposed in a common horizontal  plane there is a tendency for smaller solids to rest on top of  larger solids during their passage across the screen.  however  this difficulty is mitigated by providing a second disc screen  (5) below the first so that the solids tumble from the upper  screen (4) onto the lower screen (5).
