<ABSTRACT>
a thermal relay construction capable of operating a pair  of electrical contacts.  the thermal relay includes an electrical  heater of the self-regulating ptc type which is mounted  upon and thermally coupled directly to a bimetal snap disc  so that heat generated by the heater causes the bimetal snap  disc to overcenter and operate the electrical contacts.  the  other electrical connection to the heater is made through a  compensating blade which bears against the heater to  compensate for ambient temperature effects on the thermal  relay.  an electric range oven control uses temperature  sensitive electrical contacts in conjunction with the thermal  relay to control the oven heaters.
