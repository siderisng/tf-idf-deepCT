<ABSTRACT>
this invention describes a process for preparing a  self-emulsifiable epoxy ester copolymer mixture which  comprises esterifying a solvent-soluble carboxyl-func­ tional polymer with an epoxy resin which is a mixture com­ prising aromatic polyethers containing oxirane function­ ality, at least 5% of the aromatic polyethers being consti­ tuted by diepoxide, the mixture of aromatic polyethers con­ stituting at least 40% of the total resin solids content and  providing oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric defi­ ciency with respect to carboxyl funtionality in the carb­ oxyl-functional polymer of from 1:2 to 1:20, the esterifi­ cation being carried out in organic solvent medium in the  presence of greater than 2% of an amine esterification  catalyst, based on the weight of the reactants subjected  to esterification, and at an elevated temperature sufficient  to cause the oxirane functionality to react with the carboxyl  functionality until the oxirane functionality is substantially  entirely consumed and reacting at least a portion of the  carboxyl functionality in the resultant polymer-epoxy resin  hydroxy ester reaction product with a base to render this  action product self-emulsifiable in water.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a process for the preparation of self-emulsifiable epoxy ester copolymer mixtures useful in the production of aqueous emulsion coating compositions and to the products produced thereby. the present invention provides a process for preparing a self-emulsifiable epoxy ester copolymer mixture which comprises esterifying a solvent-soluble carboxyl-functional polymer with an epoxy resin which is a mixture comprising aromatic polyethers containing oxirane functionality, at least 5% of the aromatic polyethers being constituted by diepoxide, the mixture of aromatic polyethers constituting at least 40% of the total resin solids content and providing oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric deficiency with respect to carboxyl functionality in the carboxyl-functional polymer of from 1:2 to 1: :20, the esterification being carried out in organic solvent medium in the presence of greater than 2% of an amine esterification catalyst, based on the weight of the reactants subjected to esterification, and at an elevated temperature sufficient to cause the oxirane functionality to react with the carboxyl functionality until the oxirane functionality is substantially entirely consumed and reacting at least a portion of the carboxyl functionality in the resultant polymer-epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction product with a base to render this reaction product self-emulsifiable in water. epoxy resins contain a plurality of aromatic groups joined together by ether linkages, and hence provide excellent physical and chemical properties. it has been difficult to employ such resins in aqueous tedium because they lack storage stability which is of particular importance when spray applicatiod is contemplated, especially for the interior of sanitary cans. in order to employ aqueous coatings of higher resin solids content at the desired viscosity, it has been necessary to employ an emulsion system in which a water immiscible component is suspended in an aqueous continuum by means of an emulsifying agent. in the self-emulsifiable mixtures produced according to the process of the present invention, the particle size of the emulsion is substantially the same regardless of whether high speed agitation is used or whether the mixture with water is barely stirred. in the preferred self-emulsifiable mixtures produced according to the present invention, a nongelled hydroxy ester copolymer composition substantially free of oxirane functionality comprises an acidic copolymer-epoxy resin hydroxy ester in which the epoxy resin is a mixture containing at least 5% by weight of aromatic polyether containing oxirane functionality which is consumed by reaction with the acidic copolymer. the acidic copolymer is a solution copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising at least about 20% of monoethylenic carboxylic acid, based on the total weight of monomers, and the epoxy resin mixture constitutes at least about 40% of the total resin solids content and provides oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric deficiency with respect to carboxyl functionality in the acidic copolymer of from 1:2 to 1:20. at least a portion of the carboxyl functionality in the copolymer-epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction product is reacted with a base to render the reaction product self-emulsifiable in water'. an aminoplast or phenoplast resin in small proportion may be used to
