<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides an unsupported vanadium  oxide catalyst containing chromium oxide, its  preparation and its use in the vapor phase oxidation of  lower aliphatic hydrocarbons.  the catalyst with superior  crush strength for the use in said reaction for the high  yield conversion of said hydrocarbons such as n-butane to  corresponding monocarboxylic acids such as acetic acid  is prepared by the reduction of a vanadium oxide containing  chromium catalyst.  the catalyst is an unsupported  one in that the vanadium oxide is a reduced  vanadium oxide in which the vanadium ions have a  valence less than five.  the catalyst contains from about  1 to about 60 mole percent chromium oxide calculated as  chromium (iii) oxide.
