<ABSTRACT>
The design of the steam humidifier is characterized in that it consists of a double-walled vapor distribution tube (4, 5).Due to the steam-heated jacket room (6), the interior (7) remains condensate-free by cooling the airflow.The steam discharged the air steam is thus removed from the condensate-free interior (7) and a splash of Kon Denswasser is avoided.Since the blow moltons (11) are arranged along the blowpipe (3) and distributed over the entire channel cross-section, steam layers are avoided.
