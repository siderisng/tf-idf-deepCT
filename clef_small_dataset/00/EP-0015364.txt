<ABSTRACT>
A monostable Multivibrator built from field effect transistors supplies uninfluenced transistor threshold changes pulses with defined pulse width and steep pulse flanks. It consists essentially of two cross-coupled field effect transistors. In this case, the first (T3) of the cross-face pelt transistors with its gate is directly connected to the drain of the second transistor (T7), which simultaneously forms the output (0) of the multivibrator. The cross-coupling path between the drain of the first transistor (T3) and the gate of the second transistor (T7) contains the series circuit of a capacitance (C1) and the source drain line of another field effect transistor (T6), which, in contrast to the other transistors belongs to the mixing type and whose gate is associated with a reference potential. The source of the first and second transistors (T3, T7) is also placed on this reference potential. Finally, the connection point between D capacitance (C1) and the transistor (T6) is connected to the Be tension potential via a WI removal element forming transistor (T8). The transistors (T6, T8) lying in the a cross-coupling path form a PE gel shift stage, which after supply of a triggering pulse output pulses of the multivibrator with short rise and decay times. The pulse width of the output pulses is controlled by the size of the capacitance (C1) in this cross-coupling path. An astabable multivibrator is formed by a suitable interconnection of two as described and each on the output about a ln verteter stage, an astabable multivibrator is formed.
