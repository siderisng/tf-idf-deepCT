<ABSTRACT>
1.  gas laser with transverse excitation at atmospheric pressure, comprising a housing (12, 12', 21, 21') containing an electrode system (10, 11) in a gas stream, the first electrode (10) of the system, which electrode (10) serves for the main discharge, being connected to a high voltage lead (22) leading to the outside, the housing having a mirror (18) at its closed end, which, in operation as a laser, totally reflects the laser beam to the other end, and which is connected, by way of spacer elements (16) which ensure mechanical stability, to a semi-transparent mirror (18) fixed in the region of this second end face, each of the mirrors (18) being replaced by a closure window when the laser is operated as an amplifier, for transmitting the amplified laser beam, both the mirrors (18) and the closure windows being arranged at the height of the space between the electrodes (10, 11) ; the interior of the housing being subdivided into a resonator chamber (5) for accommodating the discharge and a cooler or ventilator chamber (6) by means of a partition (3) which is integral with the second electrode (11) of the electrode system (10, 11) which electrode is provided for the main discharge, the said two chambers (5, 6) being interconnected by a gas transport channel (8), characterised in that the wall is constructed as an earth rail (3) bearing against the longitudinal side walls (21, 21') of the housing, and in that the gas transport channel (8) extends along the outside of the housing.
