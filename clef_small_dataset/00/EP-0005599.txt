<ABSTRACT>
a bi-directional filter-drier (30) especially for use in a  heat pump-system has an adsorption space for adsorbing  material (35).  each end of the space is closed off by a valve  assembly (40) and a filter pad assembly (50).  the valve  assembly (40) allows flow of liquid into but not out of the  space.  the pad assembly (50) includes a diaphragm (57)  which allows flow of liquid out of the space through a filter  pad (53) but not into the space.  a line connector (33) is  provided for liquid to flow into each valve assembly (40) and  these connectors (33) may be used by liquid flowing out of  the space through the pad assemblies (50) or separate  discharge caps 94 may be provided.
