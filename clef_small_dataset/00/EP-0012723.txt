<ABSTRACT>
Dam testimonies to be examined for printing quality are scanned in point by photoelectrically and compared with one or more templates.The resulting remission value differences are processed in different correction levels and then subjected to a point-by-point threshold decision, with an individual threshold value being used for each pixel.The thresholds are obtained by analysis of testimonials with tolerable deviations by using the maximum positive and negative remission value Differenzen directly as thresholds due to their absorption.The analysis is based on electronically simulated specimens by electronically changing template (s) and a test specimen electronically relatively relatively ver and remission values are electronically changing who to pretend register deviations and tint deviations.
