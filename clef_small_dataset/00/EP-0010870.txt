<ABSTRACT>
a key (26) comprises a resistor (r40) of a predetermin足 ed value which can be connected to a socket (s) of an  electronic lock, where it forms a divider with a resistor  (r29).  a window comparator (a2, a3) determines whether  or not a resistor in a certain range around the predetermin足 ed value has been connected and provides a signal ac足 cordingly.  this lock and key is used to arm and disarm an intruder  alarm in which changes in signal from an ultrasonic trans足 mitter (u1) to an ultrasonic receiver (u2) caused by the  presence of an intruder are detected.
