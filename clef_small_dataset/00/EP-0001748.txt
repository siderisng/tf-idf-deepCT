<ABSTRACT>
improvement of the polyarloxy and polyalkylaryloxyphosphazenes  such as those described in united states  patent 3,853,794 is achieved by treating such polyphosphazenes  with organic amines, preferably in solution.  the  polyphosphazenes are chemically modified as a result of  such treatment and are converted from tough fibrous materials  to relatively soft readily processed products.
