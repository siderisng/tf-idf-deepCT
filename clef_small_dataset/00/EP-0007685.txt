<ABSTRACT>
a flexible container (1) for liquids in which a collar (8) is  fixed to one wall (2) and the container is filled through this  collar.  a flap (5) having one heat sealable surface is attached  to one wall of the container with its heat sealable surface  underlying the collar so that after filling the collar can be  closed by the flap and the filled container sealed for transporÂ­ tation.  subsequently the collar can be fitted with a tap which  breaks the flap seal and enables the contents of the flexible  container to be dispensed.
