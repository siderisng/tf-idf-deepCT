<ABSTRACT>
a transmission system providing for simultaneous con足 ventional baseband telephone signaling and digital data  transmission between a pair of subscribers (a and b) on non足 loaded telephone (13 and 17) wires.  the system includes a  modem (21) located near each telephone (23).  each modem  21 is connected to the telephone (23) and to digital data termi足 nals (25) and includes a data transmitter that converts digital  data to be transmitted from binary form into f1/f2 fsk form  and a receiver that converts received digital data from f3/f4  form into binary form.  a repeater (33) located at a central  office (11) bidirectionally converts the f1/f2 fsk signals pro足 duced by one subscriber (a or b) into f3/f4 fsk signals for  receipt by the other subscriber (b or a).  the subsystems  include voice frequency filters for presenting fsk signals for  reaching telephones and line switching equipment and high  frequency noise signals generated by the telephones from  reaching the nonloaded telephone wires (13,17).
