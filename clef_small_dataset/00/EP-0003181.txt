<ABSTRACT>
to provide a hermetic seal for flexible receptacles such  as plastic bags, pouches, or casings, the outside of the  mouth (11) of the receptacle is coated with a cold-flowing  resin so that when the receptacle is filled and its mouth (11)  gathered under pressure the resin will cold flow and fill the  voids in the gathered folds.  preferably, the end of the  gathered mouth (11) is trimmed and then high pressure is  applied to cause the resin (10â€²) to exude from the trimmed  end.  next, a moulding plunger (9) is used to press the  exudate into a smooth surface whereby a fused cap of resin  is formed hermetically closing the bag's mouth (11).  as an  alternative, a clip or band can be placed around the gathered  end under sufficient pressure to cause cold flow of the resin  thereby sealing the voids.
