<ABSTRACT>
1.  installation for bulk product storage in a circular blending area where the product is piled in successive layers with, in cross-section, the shape of a chevron, the top of which being slightly inclined with respect to the horizontal, in such a way as to form a stockpile (2) regularly decreasing in size along a path which follows the arc of a circle, the installation including a stacker (7) with a circular movement above the stockpile (2) which is being formed around a drive shaft, a feed conveyor for the stacker, and a system controlling the shifting of the origin of the path in the arc of a circle as a function of the quantity of the product brought to the feed conveyor, the installation being characterized by the fact that the said shifting system includes a stacker (7) drive shaft rotation detector (17 or 17') which delivers a number of pulses proportional to the angle of rotation of the stacker, and a count-douwn meter (18 or 18') into which is introduced periodically a constant number of pulses proportional to the angular extend of the stockpile (2) which is being formed, this number being corrected periodically by a constant number of pulses which corresponds to the shift at an even step, the pulses being generated by a system monitoring a predetermined quantity of the product supplied to the feed conveyor (9) of the stacker (7).
