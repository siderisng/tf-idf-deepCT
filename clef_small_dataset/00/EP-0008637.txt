<ABSTRACT>
an electronically scanned phased array diagnostic sys­ tem for describing internal structure of a subject by the use of  ultrasonic energy.  the system includes a transducer unit with  an array of ultrasonic energy conversion segments and con­ trol circuitry for actuating the segments to direct ultrasonic  energy into the subject.  imaging circuitry is included for inter­ preting electrical return signals produced by the segments in  response to ultrasonic echoes.  the imaging circuitry includes  transmission delay circuits for imposing time delays on the  return signals for steering and focusing system echo recep­ tion.  each transmission delay circuit includes first and second  delay elements for impressing first and second delay time  components on the return signals.  each pair of the first delay  elements are coupled in parallel with separate transducer  elements, and serially combined with a downstream second  delay element.  the first delay elements provide a portion of  the reception steering capability.  the second elements pro­ vide the remainder of the steering, and the beam focusing,  delay components.  the system further includes display  apparatus responsive to the delayed return signals for pro­ ducing an image of the subject's internal structure.
