<ABSTRACT>
an electro-erosion head assembly is formed from a stack  of thin laminae 6 of electrically conductive material.  each  lamina has narrow extensions from an edge thereof to form  electrodes 2.  a connector tab 4 extends from the other edge  thereof.  each lamina 6 is coated with a thin coating of insulation  material except on the connector tab 4 which is tin-lead  coated for eventual soldering.  the insulated laminae are  stacked to form a head assembly and are encapsulated in  plastics potting compound 16 which is ground down to  expose the end faces of the electrodes.  the electrodes 2 are  located at the same locations on each lamina 6 so that, when  stacked, they form heads comprising columns of electrodes,  each capable of forming a spot in the electro-erosion process.   the connector tabs 4 are spaced from one another at the other  edge of the sheets so as to make each connector tab available  for a solder connection and thus give the required connection  fanout.
