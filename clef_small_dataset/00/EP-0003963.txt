<ABSTRACT>
a field effect transistor (fet) protection circuit adapted to  operate at high switching speeds and to avoid hot electron  operation of voltage stressed fet bootstrap drivers.  the circuit  comprises a voltage control means adapted to maintain a  combined gate and drain to source voltage of fet devices  within a characteristic hot electron operational voltage range,  by connecting a plurality of fet devices (3, 5) in series, by  connecting the common nodes of successive series connected  devices (3, 5) to a specified voltage source, by clamping  the gate voltage, by providing timing pulses that define  particular combinations of gate and drain to source device  voltages, or by providing width to length ratios adapted to  provide close voltage tracking between input drain voltages  and output source voltages.  the operation of the hot electron  voltage control means is particularly described with respect to  embodiments using voltage stressed bootstrap driver fets to  generate on chip clock phases.
