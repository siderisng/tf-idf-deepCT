<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a method of making up an animal  feedstuff in pelleted form, comprising mixing together a plur­ ality of nutritional ingredients in powdered, granular, commi­ nuted or the like form, together with a binding agent compris­ ing plaster of paris and a urea-formaldehyde resin and in the  presence of water and a catalyst for the resin, forming the  mixture into pellets or cakes, and allowing the pellets or cakes  to set.  the use of the binder disclosed allows the composition  of the feedstuff to be determined by dietary considerations  without regard to the mechanical and adhesive properties of  the nutritional components.

<DESCRIPTION>
tills invention relates to a binding agent for use in binding powdered, granular, comminuted or similarly divided material together to form larger bodies such as pellets, cakes or the like. the invention is particularly, but not exclusively applicable to the binding together of the components of animal feed materials in pellets. most dry animal feed supplied to farmers as a compound feed containing a number cf ingredients is presented in pelleted form. the use of this form has a number of beneficial effects. thus such use simplifies the calculation and administering of balanced feed rations to animals on the farm, prevents segregation of ingredients during processing, transpcrt storage and handling, and minimises losses of finely ground ingredients during handling operations and while animals are feeding. the use of the pelleted form also prevents rejection by the animal of certain ingredients beneficial to the animal but not particularly palatable. when pelleting processes were first introduced it was found that the mi of feedstuff ingredients and the conditions used could be arranged so that binders occurring naturally in one or more of the feed components kept the pellets together reasonably well. as the composition of feedstuffs came to be more closely dictated by commercial and nutritional considerations, however, it was found that the mix so dictated could not also be designed so that the pellets would be held together adequately by the binders occurring naturally in the constituents and so additional binding agents were necessary. a variety of materials have been tried as binding agents, the most popular being clay minerals and lignin sulphonate added as a significant percentage (e.g. 1 to 5%) of the feed. one disadvantage of these binding agents'is that they must, to be effective, form a significant percentage of the pellet material, whilst contributing little to the feed value of the pellet. clay minerals can also contribute significantly to wear of the extrusion head of the pelleting machine used to form the pellets. furthermore the current developments in animal feed technology indicate that pellets with a greater proportion of fat than hitherto are required by the industry for optimum animal nutrition and high energy content feed. it is found that an increase in fat content necessitates a further increase in the proportion of conventional binding agent necessary to prevent undue break-up of the pellets. the basic technology of the known processes used for making pelleted animal feeds is as follows: the major ingredients, for example various types of ground cereal, molasses, fat and protein meal, are mixed thoroughly in a mixing vessel together-with any binding agents used. the material then passes through a steam chamber where live steam is injected into the mix. the quantity of steam employed and the time spent in the chamber by the material is monitored and controlled carefully in order to bring the mass to the optimum temperature and water content for the next stage. this next stage is the pelleting process where the feed material is forced under considerable pressure through stainless
