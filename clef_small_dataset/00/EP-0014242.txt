<ABSTRACT>
A method and an arrangement for car matic suppression of weather echoes, which can occur in addition to the missile double signal as further double signals in a pulse double-striker adjuster with quadrature channels. For this purpose, a control loop formed by a feedback loop from the receiver output (VQ, VI, UQ, UI, SF) to a modulator (MD) of the phase reference signal is closed, whose fault pancel signal is the output signal of a frequency discrimina Tor (FDK) whose input signals is linked to who that the DC voltage component of the discriminator output signal is at least approximately a measure of the Doppler frequency of the weather-related weather echo signals which are not located between the volume halves, wherein with this DC voltage portion, the average frequency of the weather echo Doppler signal is a value smaller than that under the cutoff frequency of the Doppler filter , regulated and thus suppressed by the Doppler filters.
