<ABSTRACT>
a self contained pressure-sensitive record material car­ ries a coating composition comprising both pressure-­ rupturable capsules containing a solution of a substantially  colourless chromogenic compound and pressure-rupturable  capsules containing a solid acidic resin which reacts with said  chromogenic compound on contact therewith to form a col­ oured image forming compound.  the composition is applied  to the substrate in a single coating step.  the resulting record  material affords good imaging characteristics and a low  degree of print bleed.
