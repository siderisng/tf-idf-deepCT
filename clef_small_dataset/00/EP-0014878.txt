<ABSTRACT>
a plug means (64) for effecting a temporary blockage of a  passage (95) through which liquid is designed to flow.  the  subject plug means (64) includes a frame means (66,68) cap­ able of being readily disassembled and embodying in the  assembled state dimensions corresponding to the cross-­ sectional dimensions of the passage (95) in which the plug  means (64) is to be employed, and inflatable means mount­ able on the frame means and co-operable therewith for pro­ viding a liquid tight seal in the passage (95).  the frame means  comprises a frame (66,68) member including a plurality of  readily interconnectable sections of plate, 74,76,78,80,82,84)  the latter each possessing a high strength-to-weight ratio;  interconnecting means (86,88,90,92) effecting the intercon­ nection of the plurality of plate sections (74,76,78,80,82,84),  and securing means (106,108) cooperable with means  (114,116) provided in the side walls of the passage (95) for  securing the frame means and thereby the plug means (64) in  the passage (95) in blocking relation thereto.  the inflatable  means includes at least one resilient member (70,72) that is  provided with a rim in the form of an inflatable bead (70a,72a).   the inflatable means is moutable on the frame member  (66,68) so as to be positionable substantially in circumferen­ tially enveloping relation relative thereto.  the inflatable  means further includes an externally accessible inflation  means (98,100) connected to the inflatable bead (70a,72a),  and operable to effect the inflation thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
nozzle plug for submersible vessel background of the invention this invention relates to plugs of the type that are employable in a passage to effect the blockage of liquid therethrough, and more particularly to a nozzle plug that is capable of being used to provide a temporary liquid tight seal of the inlet nozzle and/or outlet nozzle of a steam generator of the kind that is cooperatively associated with a nuclear reactor in a conventional nuclear power generating system. it is long been known in the prior art to employ a plug to effect the blockage of a normally open passage, when for some particular reason such action is deemed necessary. moreover, the prior art is known to be replete with examples of various forms of plugs, which differ one from another in terms of configuration, mode of construction, etc. on the other hand, even though a multiplicity of plugs of different design exist in the prior-art, there continue to arise applications wherein it would be desirable to be able to employ a plug, however, due to the peculiar nature of the application, the plugs of known design, which are presently available, are unsuitable for use therein. one such application involves the accomplishment of the blockage of the inlet nozzle and/or the outlet nozzle of a steam generator, the latter being of the type that is suitable for employment in cooperative association with a nuclear reactor to form therewith a component part of a nuclear power generating system. the steam generator to which reference is had here may, for purposes of this discussion, be construed as constituting simply a closed shell, which has formed therein a means through which fluid enters the steam qenera- tor and another means through which fluid exits from the steam generator. these means comprise, more specifically, an inlet nozzle and an outlet nozzle, respectively. periodically, there arises a need to conduct maintenance on and/or to effect minor repairs of the internal components of the steam generator. to accomplish such tasks, it is necessary for one or more persons to actually physically enter the steam generator. ingress into and egress from the steam generator by such persons is accomplished through suitable means#-such as for instance a manhole, etc., that has been provided for this purpose. while such persons are working in the steam generator, it is desirable that a blockage of the inlet nozzle and the outlet nozzle of the steam generator be effected to insure that there will be no fluid flow through the steam generator, which might imperil the lives of the people working therein. a nuclear power generating system is designed to be operative, ire., on line, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. whenever the nuclear power generating system is not operating, i.e., is shut down, either as a result of a malfunction in some part of the system or in accordance with a preestablished scheduled shutdown, it is imperative that the nuclear power generating system be brought back on line
