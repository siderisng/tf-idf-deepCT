<ABSTRACT>
a secondary container packaging material for use in six  pack can wraps, six pack bottle carriers, twelve pack carriers,  etc, comprising a composite of a paper material (12) lami足 nated to a plastic film (14).  the plastic film provides tear  resistance to the composite, so that paper material may be  used which has a tear resistance less than that of other secon足 dary packaging paper materials.  the reduced tear resistance  allows the use of paper having a lower caliper, basis weight,  and, therefore, cost than conventional secondary container  packaging material.  natural kraft paper and recycled paper of  12-16 point caliper are preferred for use with the present  composite.  the plastic film may be . 25-2 mils thick and is  preferably formed of polyethylene terphthalate,  polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, or cel足 lophane.  the preferred films are transparent and permit  reverse printing (26) on their inner surface (32) to provide  abrasion resistant decoration visible through the film.  adhe足 sives (28) are used to bond the film to the paper and are  selected to be compatible with the film used.  the film may be  metallized to produce a foil effect or may be strengthened by  radiation treatment (24).
