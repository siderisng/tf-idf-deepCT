<ABSTRACT>
a programmable controller of the type used to solve  relay ladder diagrams includes a memory into which is pla­ ced a digital representation of the rungs of the ladder dia­ gram.  the dispositions of various switches and coils are  periodically sampled by portions of the programmable con­ troller and stored in known memory locations.  at appro­ priate times between sampling intervals, the various memo­ ry information are combined and provided to a relay line  solver which updates the status of the relay ladder diagram  and restores the updated information in a memory.  the  programming portion of the programmable controller inclu­ des up, open and return keys which may be manipu­ lated by an operator in an appropriate manner for entering  the ladder diagram initially into the programmable control­ ler memory or for updating or charging the status of the  various rungs of the ladder diagram.  the entry keys are  such that contact interconnection information is entered  into the memory at the same time and by the same keys  that are utilized to enter the contact information; no sepa­ rate memory words are required for contact interconnec­ tion information.  very complex rungs of ladder diagrams  may be entered using the three previously-mentioned keys.  the sequence of ladder-diagram entry into the memo­ ry of the programmable controller is decided by contact-­ interconnection information which is displayed to a key  operator to facilitate which contact is to be entered next in  sequence.
