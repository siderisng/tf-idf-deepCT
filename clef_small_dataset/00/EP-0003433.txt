<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to the location of contact faults on  electrically conductive cables such as telephone pairs.   contact fault location apparatus has a pair of resistors (24,  25), a constant current source (22) and means such as a  differential amplifier (30) and meter (35) for sensing the  current flowing in the resistors (24, 25).  a pair of lines (10, 11)  to be tested is looped at one end (15), the apparatus is  connected across the other end and the current flowing in  the resistors (24, 25) is measured.  the ratio of the current is  indicative of the distance to the fault.
