<ABSTRACT>
Gearing machine (pump or motor) with helix-toothed gears (11, 16) combing in the outer engagement or interior engagement, whose shafts are rotatably mounted in the housing and / or housing cover or in the housing bearing bodies, wherein in the engagement area on the tooth wheels facing side surfaces are formed recesses , of which the pressure chamber-side recesses are connected to the pressure chamber and the suction space-side recesses with the suction chamber, characterized in that the pressure chamber-side and suction space-side recess (19, 20 or 56,58) on the leading front side (17 and 63) of the oblique toothing the symmetry position for pole (P) about a distance (V / 2) transversely to the connecting line of the two centers (M₁M₂) of the gears (11,16) in the direction of suction space is shifted, and that the pressure chamber-side and suction space-side recess (21,22 or 55 , 57) At the dilating end face (18 and 61) of the helical toothing from the symmetry position Pole (P) is shifted by an equal distance (V / 2) transversely to the connecting line of the two centers (M₁M₂) in the direction of the pressure chamber.
