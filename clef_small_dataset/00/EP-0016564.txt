<ABSTRACT>
a toothbrush (10) comprising a head portion (12) having a  plurality of tufts extending therefrom, a handle portion (11),  the portions (11 and 12) having interengagable formations  (15,44; 19,38; 20,40) whereby the head portion (12) is adapted  to be removably carried by the handle portion (11), and snap  engagement means (21,41) so that when the head portion (12)  is located on the handle portion (11) and moved rearwardly  thereof, the snap engagement means (21,41) operates with a  'clicking' sound.

<DESCRIPTION>
"disposable head toothbrush" description this invention relates to brushes and particularly to toothbrushes. in the interest ox oral hygiene, dentists have recomendea that toothbrushes be replaced as frequently as possible since, after a relatively shot period of use, tuts of the brushes become flattened and no longer effectively clean teeth. however, with the increasing cost of plasties materials, toothbrushes are becoming ore expensive and the cost does not encourage regular replacement. as a result, the general standard of oral hygiene is lower than would be the case if toothbrushes were less expensive to replace. according to the present invention there is provided a brush comprising a head portion having a plurality of tufts extending therefrom, a handle portion, the portions having interengagable formations whereby the head portion is adapted to be removably carried by the handle portion and when so carried to be movable relative to the handle portion in a predetereined direction an snap engagement means for resisting a force applied in the said direction to separate the portions one from the other, the arrangement being such that the snap engagement means resists said force until a component of the force exceeds a predetermined magnitude causing release of the snap engagement means to erit separation of the said potions. the interengable formations may comprise a plug an a socket. the plug and socket may be of comple- mentary configurations. the snap engagement means may comp rise complementary abutment surfaces carried by the plug and socket respectively. one of said abutment surfaces may be located in the socket. the socket may be provided with a cavity which tapers in a longitudinal direction of the recess. the plug may comprise a pair of transversely spaced elongate members adapted to engage therebetween said abutment surface in the socket. a wall of the socket may be inclined inwardly towards a longitudinal axis of the socket. the socket may be open in a direction transverse to the said longitudinal axis ana in a direction parallel to said longitudinal axis. the socket may be in the head portion. the head portion may comprise a surface having te tufts extending therefrom, the surface being inclined fro s leading edge thereof to e trailing edge thereof. the head portion may conprise an additional surface having tufts extending therefrom, the additional surface extending at an angle to the said surface. following is a description, by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of carrying the invention into effect. in the drawings: figure 1 is a plan view of one embodiment of a toothbrush in accordance with the present invention, figure 2 is an elevation of the toothbrush shown in figure 1, figure 3 is a diagrammatic representation showing the manner in which a head and a handle of the toothbrush shown in figures 1 and 2 are interconnected, figure 4 is a longitudinal cross section of the head and handle of the toothbrush shown in figures 1 t 4 , the
