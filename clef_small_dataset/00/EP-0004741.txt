<ABSTRACT>
thio etianic acid derivatives of the formula    wherein x¹ is hydrogen, fluoro, or chloro;   x² is hydrogen, fluoro, chloro or bromo;   x³ is =c=o or    or may also be   when x² is chloro;   r is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or phenyl or benzyl  optionally substituted with a substituent on the phenyl ring  which is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon  atoms or halo;   r¹ is hydrogen or alkanoyl of 2 to 6 carbon atoms when  r² is hydrogen, α-methyl or β-methyl or or¹ and r² together  are 16α, 17α-isopropylidenedioxy; and the solid and broken  lines between c-1 and c-2 represent a double or single bond;  are useful an anti-inflammatory steroids.  they can be  prepared by reacting the corresponding 17β-carboxylic acid  or a reactive derivative thereof with an alkali metal salt of  rsh.
