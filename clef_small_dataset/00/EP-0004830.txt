<ABSTRACT>
a ball bearing swivel comprises a substantially bowl-shaped  casing member (1) having first connection means (3,  4) in its closed end, and a stud member (2) having second  connection means (20, 21) in that one of its ends which faces  away from the casing member.  the stud member (2) is  journalled in the bowl-shaped housing member (1) by means  of a ball or roller bearing.  for eliminating the risk of accidents  through one of the wires or the like to which the swivel is  connected, if the other wire or the like which is connected to  the swivel should get into contact with an electrical overhead  line or another possibly high-tensioned object, the ball  bearing swivel also comprises an electrically insulating  insert (13, 14) by means of which the bowl-shaped casing  member (1) of the ball bearing swivel is electrically insulated  from the stud member (2).
