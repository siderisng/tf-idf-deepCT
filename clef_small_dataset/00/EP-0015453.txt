<DESCRIPTION>
synergistic herbicidal compositions and method for controlling undesirable vegetation. the protection of crops from weeds and other vegetation which inhibit crop growth by consuming valuable acreage or soil nutrients is a constantly recurring problem in agriculture. to help combat this problem, researchers in the field of synthetic chemistry have produced an extensive variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in the control of such unwanted growth. chemical herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a large number are in commercial use. in many cases, active herbicides have been shown to be more effective in combination than when applied individually. the result is often termed "synergism", since the combination demonstrates a potency or activity level exceeding that which it would be expected-to have, based on a knowledge of the individual potencies of the components. the present invention resides in the discovery that certain pyrrolidones and certain'phosphonic acids, already known individually for their herbicidal potency, display this synergistic effect when applied in combination. the two classes of compounds forming the combination which is the subject of the present invention are independently known in the art as active herbicides. pyrrolidones are disclosed as herbicides in u.s. patent no. 4 110 105 (teach, august 29, 1979), and phosphonic acids are similarly disclosed in u.s. patent: - no. 3 853 530 (franz, decembre 10, 1974), - no. 3 799 758 (franz, march 26, 1974), and -no. 3 929 450 (hamm, decembre 30, 1975), as well as numerous other references including: - maynard et al., "organophosphorus compounds. i. 2-chloroalkylphosphonic acids as phosphorylating agents", aust. j. clun., 16, 596)608 (1963), and - yang, "ethylene evolution from 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid", pzant ptlysyfoz., 44, 1203-1304 (1969). -s as now been found that synergism in the control of undesirable vegetat r, is exhibited by compositions comprising a mixture of the followir- two components: @(a) a pyrrolidone of the formula: emi2.1 in dhich: : x is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine and methyl; y is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine and bromine; z is selected from the group consisting of chlorine and cl-c4 alkyl; r1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and c1-c4 alkyl; r2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, cr-c4 alkyl, acetyl, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, c1-c4 alkoxy, c1-c4 alkylthio, c,-c4 alkylsulfinyl, c1-c4 alkylsulfonyl, trifluoromethyl thio, tri fl uoromethyl sul fi nyl, tri fl uoromethyl sul fonyl , pentafl uoro propionamido, and 3-methylureido; and r3-is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, c1-c4 alkyl, chlorine and trifluoromethyl; ; and i(b) a phosphonic acid of the formula: emi2.2 in which: r4 is selected from the group consisting of c1-c4 alkyl, c1-c4 haloalkyl, and -ch2nhch2cooh. in the compositions of the present invention, pyrrolidones of the following formula are preferred: emi2.3 in which: r2 is trifluoromethyl or cyano. -the term 'alkyl' as usen herain includes both stright-chain and branhec-crain grobss. the carbon canges are intended to be inclusive oss sth ubber and lower limits. -the terms "syanergism" and "synergistic"
