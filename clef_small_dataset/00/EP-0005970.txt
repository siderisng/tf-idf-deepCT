<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a lid (1) of moulded plastics  material for a fruit box (11), particularly a tomato box.  the lid  has a rim (2) and depending skirt (3) so that it can fit the top  edge of the box and is provided with a centre portion of open  lattice work (7) and a plurality of upstanding protrusions (4)  which when one box (11) is stacked on top of another serve  to space the boxes apart so that air can freely circulate  between the fruit.  the protrusions (4) are preferably provided  with upstanding spikes (5) which become embedded in  the underside of a box located on top and so prevent slipping  of the boxes.  the protrusions (4) are of hollow frusto-conical  shape so that the lids (1) can nest one within the other for  storage.
