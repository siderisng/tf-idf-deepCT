<ABSTRACT>
For computer electron flash units, the triggered flash is then interrupted when the light reflected from the object to be recorded is achieved a certain value.Whether this value is achieved by means of a light measuring device, which is usually located in the flash, which can also be accommodated in an external sensor connectable to the flash unit.In recent cameras, the light measuring device is also provided in the camera itself, which measures the light passing through the lens and controls the flash.According to the invention, for an electron flasher (1) equipped with a terminal (2) for an external sensor, an adapter (8-12, 16, 17) is provided which occurs to the site of the external sensor and via the camera sideFlash connections (4, 5) with a camera is connectable, which has a light measuring device for controlling flash units.
