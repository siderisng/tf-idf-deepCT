<ABSTRACT>
a semiconductor device in which gates are formed in  v-shaped grooves which grooves are formed in a semiconÂ­ ductor bulk, and which device has vmis transistors which  make access to information by giving or taking out an electric  charge with respect to junction capacitances established by  capacitor regions that are embedded in the vicinity of the tips  of v-shaped grooves.  the feature of the semiconductor  device resides in that the capacitor region, consisting of an  embedded layer of capacitors over a large area, is divided by  the tips of a plurality of v-shaped grooves.
