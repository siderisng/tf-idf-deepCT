<ABSTRACT>
a receptacle connector (2) comprises an insulating hous­ ing (6) having an opening (12) for receiving a plug (68), con­ tact springs (58) on contacts (52b) in the housing (6) extend­ ing obliquely across the opening (12) for engaging the con­ tacts (not shown) on the underside of the plug (68).  each  contact (52b) comprises a flat strip of metal and lies in a  channel (46b) in the housing (6), a tail portion (60b) of the  contact (52b) extending from the housing (6) through a hole  in a printed circuit board (4), the contacts (52b) being  retained by barbs (62b) thereon in the channels (46b).   according to the method of manufacturing the receptacle  connector, contacts (52b) are applied to the housing (6)  simultaneously, in the form of juxtaposed rectilinear metal  strips (not shown) joined by carrier strips, the rectilinear  strips being then bent to shape by means of tooling (not  shown) in cooperation with the housing (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
an electrical plug receptacle connector and a method of manufacturing such a connector. this invention relates to an electrical plug receptacle connector and to a method of manufacturing such a connector. there is disclosed in united states patent specification no. 3,850,497, an electrical plug receptacle connector comprising an insulating housing having a plug-receiving end and a rearward end, a plug-receiving opening extending into the plug-receiving end, such opening having opposed internal side walls and opposed internal end walls, the housing having opposed external side walls and opposed external end walls, a plurality of electrical contacts arranged in juxtaposed spaced relationship, each comprising a contact spring portion extending from one of the internal side walls at a position adjacent to the plugreceiving end, obliquely into the opening and towards the opposite internal side wall, and each contact having a portion extending from the plug-receiving end through the housing between the one internal side wall and the adjacent external side wall and towards the rearward end of the housing, the plug-receiving opening being dimensioned to receive an electrical olug connector having spaced contact members therein for engaging the contact spring portions of the contacts of the receptacle connector. the plug connector is described in detail in united states patent specification no. 3,860,316, for example. although this known receptacle connector is widely used in the telephone industry, it is being used to an increasing extent on equipment other than telephone equipment, for example, data processing equipment which may be installed adjacent to a telephone exchange, small computers and similar equipment. it is a disadvantage of the known receptacle connector that the contacts are in the form of circular cross-section wire springs constituting the contact spring portions of the contacts and being connected to lead wires by means of ferrules crimped to the leads and to the wire springs to splice them together, the ferrules being lodged in individual bores formed in the housing between the one internal side wall and the adjacent external side wall. the manufacture of the known receptacle connector must therefore include the steps of crimping the ferrules to the wire springs and the lead wires, and of then inserting the individual ferrules into the bores. it is another disadvantage of the known receptacle connector that it is unadapted for mounting on a printed circuit panel as would be desirable for example where the receptacle connector is to be used in data processing equipment. although the wire springs, which make only line contact with the contact members of the plug connector, are suitable for the transmission of audio frequency signals, large areas of contact between the contact portions of the receptacle connector contacts and the contact members of the plug connector would be desirable in the case of the more recent applications, mentioned above, of the receptacle connector. the present invention is intended to provide a plug receptacle connector which is easier and thus more economical to manufacture than the known receptacle connector described above and which is also more
