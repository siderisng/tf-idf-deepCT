<ABSTRACT>
a chrominance signal circuit in a color television re­ ceiver comprises a pal switch (17) for reversing a subcar­ rier signal in every second line, which pal switch is driven  responsive to a flip-flop (27) the output of which is rever­ sed for every second line responsive to a horizontal pulse.   the burst signal extracted from the received color televi­ sion signal is reversed for every second line by a switch  (21, 22) also responsive to the output of the flip-flop.  the  reversed burst signal is subjected to phase detection (23)  together with a signal obtained by +90° phase shifting (24)  the subcarrier.  the phase detected output is integrated by  an integration circuit (25).  the output of the integration cir­ cuit is applied to prevent the horizontal pulse (p1') from  being applied to the flip-flop as a drive input.
