<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the reaction of foreign substances contained in wastewater and sewage sludge, in particular pollutants, especially fecal, in harmless substances with one or more arranged in a reaction basin or slut ventilation basin (8), circumferential, on the one side of the pelvis Immigrating the water or slurry and hollow bodies (1) on the other side, which lies on the appearance on the appearance above and vice versa on the immersion side. In such hollow bodies, there is a risk that mud deposits in length in the hollow bodies. In this deposited sludge an anaerobic currency can take place in the pollutants cropping, but not read. In order to avoid depositing in the hollow bodies slurry, it is proposed according to the invention to use hollow bodies which are closed laterally and at the top and below and by approximately parallel to the upper and lower bias (2.3) arranged closed partition (4 ) are divided.
