<ABSTRACT>
process for preparing cationic oxazine compounds of the formula i <image>  where   r1 and r2 are independently of each other hydrogen, an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms,   r3 and r5 are independently of each other hydrogen, an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, which may be cn-, oh-, aryl-, halogen- or alkoxy-substituted, or an alkenyl group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms,   r4 and r5 are independently of each other an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, which may be cn-, oh-, aryl-, halogen- or alkoxy- substituted, or an alkenyl group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted phenyl group or a phenyl group which is monosubstituted or polysubstituted by an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or halogen, and    x is an anion, characterised in that a compound of the formula ii <image> where r1, r3 and r4 are each as defined under the formula i, r7 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, and n is 1 or 2, is nitrosated in the presence of an acid hx, the nitrosation product is optionally isolated and then condensed with a compound of the formula iii <image> where r2, r5 and r6 are each as defined under the formula i, in the presence of heavy metal salts in the absence or presence of a basic metal salt, to form water-insoluble linear metal complexes of the heavy metal used and the linear condensation product of the nitroso compound obtained from the aminophenol ether of the formula ii and the compound of the formula iii as intermediates, which can be isolated.
