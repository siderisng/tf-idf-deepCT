<ABSTRACT>
1.  device permitting the programmed design of figures of different shapes by bombardment of a target by a particle beam of adjustable section produced by a particle source (100), the figures being composed of elementary image (r1  to r5 ) of variable shapes each associated with one reference point which may be identified by a couple of abscissa and ordinate addresses in a perpendicular reference axis system (oxy) ; the device comprising a step motor (101) assuring a displacement of the target along a first direction parallel to the abscissa axis (ox) in order to successively expose portions of the target to the particle beam during time intervals where it is stationary in this direction, and a motor (102) assuring a continuous displacement of the target along a second direction parallel to the ordinate axis (oy) ; the device being characterized in that it comprises electronic scanning means for deflecting the particle beam in a manner to cancel the relative movement of the beam with respect to the target in the second direction (oy) during a time (theta3 -theta2 ) at least the same as the time necessary for making at least one elementary image (r2 , r3 , r4 ) the reference point of which has a determined ordinate address (y2 ).
