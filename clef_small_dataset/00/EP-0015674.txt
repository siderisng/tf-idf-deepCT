<ABSTRACT>
a spiral type one-way clutching mechanism utilizes a  monolithic annular outer body member (11, 31) having an  inner surface (15, 35) of spiral configuration defining an  axially oriented opening therein.  a monolithic annular in­ ner body member (16, 36) is concentrically positioned in  the axially oriented opening and has an outer surface (34)  of spiral configuration which is tangentially congruent to  the outer body inner surface, the spiral surfaces defining a  spiral race (21, 41) therebetween.  at least one of the inner  (16, 36) and the outer (11, 31) body members have a radi­ ally directed slit (17, 37) extending therethrough.  the  outer body member (11, 31) and the inner body member  (16, 36) are relatively rotatably oscillatable with respect to  each other.  a plurality of axially oriented rollable wedging  members, e. g. , abutting roller members (22, 42), is posi­ tioned in the spiral race (21, 41), each such member being  in contact with the inner and the outer spiral surfaces.   structure (20) is provided which acts between the body  members, e. g. , at least one limit spring (18, 38) for limiting  the relative oscillatory movement therebetween.  this mechanism is thus insensitive to transverse for­ ces; substantially eliminates overrunning frictional wear  on the critically shaped surfaces of its members; and subs­ tantially eliminates the role of chance in establishing the  clutching load distribution between its members.  the me­ chanism may be used in a clutch assembly with both active  and passive clutching modes.
