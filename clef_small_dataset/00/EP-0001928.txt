<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a process for the production of highly  aromatic reformates, having a minimum of nonaromatic  material, in high yield from a naphtha feed fraction by  high-severity catalytic reforming, using a halogen-promoted  reforming catalyst.  the process comprises reforming the  naphtha feed under reforming conditions of high severity in  a plurality of sequentially arranged reaction zones in which  the concentration of the halogen component of the reforming  catalyst is adjusted to provide a minimal hydrocracking  activity relative to the other reforming reactions to the  catalyst in the first reaction zones, and an enhanced hydrocracking  activity to the catalyst in the last reaction zones.  the  reformates produced according to this process are particularly  useful in the blending of high aromatic content  gasolines and/or in the production of high purity aromatic  hydrocarbons.
