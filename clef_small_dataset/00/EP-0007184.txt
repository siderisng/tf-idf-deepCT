<DESCRIPTION>
urea derivatives, orocesses for predarinq them and compositions cont-ainine them this invention relates to urea derivatives and, more particularly to n-[3-(louer)alkylaminopropyl]-n'- (disubstituted)phenylureas, which are useful in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, and to processes for preparing, and compositions containing the n-[3-(lower)- alkylaminopropyl]-n'-(disubstituted)phenylureas and to methods of using them. heretofore the treatment of arrhythmias has been limited by drug toxicity, undesirable side effects, or variable effectiveness. accordingly a great need exists for an anti-arrhythmic agent which is efficacious and preferably which is less toxic and which has a lower incidence of undesirable side effects than. known anti-arrhythmic agents. the invention provides novel chemical compounds of general formula (i) y-nh.co.nh-ch2ch2ch2-nh-x (i) wherein: y is 2,6-dimethylphenyl, 2,5-dimethylphenyl, 5-bromo-2-methylphenyl, or 5-chloro-2-methyl phenyl; and x is propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, or isobutyl; and non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. the compounds of formula (i) wherein x is isopropyi are preferred. also preferred are those compounds of formula (i) wherein y is 2,6-dimethylphenyl or 5-chloro-2 methylphenyl. ' the compounds of formula (i) exhibit cardiac antiarrhythmic activity as-demonstrated in laboratory tests involving a variety of arrhythmic animal models. the compounds are therefore generally useful in treating both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias resulting from various underlying conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarc-tion, congenital cardiac defects, digitalis overdose, myocarditis, or other pathologicâl or toxic processes which may alter the electrical excitability of the heart. the compound of formula (i) wherein y is 2,6dimethylphenyl and x is isopropyl offers significant advantages over known anti-arrhythmic agents because of its low toxicity, longer duration of activity, and low incidence of undesirable side effects. in particular, said compound at therapeutic doses has been found to produce little or no effect on the central nervious system (such as sedation, muscle weakness, or ataxia). moreover, anti-cholinergic effects were not observed and undesirable cardiac effects (such as depressed cardiac contactility or cardiac output, were minimal at effectiue dosages. the compound of formula i wherein y is 5-chloro-2methylphenyl and x is isopropyl also offers particularly significant advantages over known anti-arrhythmic agents because of its high efficacy, particularly long duration of activity, and low incidence ofundesirable side-effects. the compounds of formula (i) can be prepared by conventional synthetic methods. the preferred method is by reaction of an appropriate disubstituted phenyl isocyanate with an n-(lower)-alkyl-1,3-diaminopropane, e.g. in an inert organic solvent, suchas dichloromethane. in order to optimise the yield, the reaction can be carried out with an excess of the diaminopropane and at a low temperature. a molar ratio of about 3 to 1 (diamine to isocyanate) is preferred and a temperature of about -5 to reaction. methods for making the protected amino compounds and for removing the protecting groups are well-known in the art. preferred protecting groups are the carbobenzoxy group and the anisylididine group (i.e. preferred z groups are carbobenzoxyåamino or anisylideneamino). the anisylidine group can be removed by treating the protected amine intermediate with hydroxylamine p-toluene-sulfonate in refluxing dicxane or ethyl alcohol. under suchconditions aminolysis takes place in situ. - the carbobenzoxy group can
