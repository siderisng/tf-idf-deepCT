<ABSTRACT>
dynamic patellar brace (10) useful for both diagnosis and  treatment of patellar subluxation.  the brace (10) includes a  patella bracing pad (15) adapted to be positioned laterally  with respect to the patella having means (17,18) to apply  medial pressure to the patella to prevent subluxation during  flextion of the knee for all normal ranges of knee flextion and  motion, and means (19) adapted to maintain the pad (15)  positioned laterally of the patella throughout said flexions  when the pad (15) is in use.  preferably the pad (15) is attached  to a sleeve (20) which is drawn up the leg (13) over the knee  and which has an aperture (21) in its side wall to receive the  patella.  the patellar brace (10) may be used to facilitate posiÂ­ tive diagnosis of patellar subluxation whose symptoms may  mimic other pathological problems of the knee and, therefore,  lead to an erroneous diagnosis.  the brace (10) may also be  used for treatment and/or to delay of avoid the need for  corrective surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
"dynamic patellar brace" the present invention relates to knee support devices, and more particularly to a brace or splinting device intended to provide dynamic bracing for and to stabilize the patella to prevent patellar subluxation during all normal degrees of knee flexion and motion. it is well-known that loosely ligamented individuals, as well as individuals with certain peculiar anatomic features of certain components of the knee, frequently develop various pathological problems with their knees, particularly when these individuals are active in physically strenuous activities, such as athletic activities. the most commonly occurring problems relate to stretching or trearing of the various knee ligaments, injury to the cartilage (meniscal) and articular surfaces of the knee joint, and-fractures. patellar subluxation or abnormal and undesirable movement of the patella, laterally, relative to its normal up and down movement in the vertical track defined by the trochlea can precipitate the onset of chondromalacia or aggravate existing chondromalacia of the patella, as well as cause diagnostic problems of the knee. subluxation of the patella can be caused by certain developmental abnormalities of the skeletal components of the knee and/or the presence of musculoligamentous laxity or dysplasia. the patella may leave its normal, vertical tracking groove as a result of abnormal vector forces and/or by passive lateral or rotary forces. the abrupt abnormal lateral displacement of the patella from its groove during any weight bearing activity (such as running, stair climbing, etc.) frequently results in immediate, temporary disability (such as buckling of the knee), causing a subjective sensation in the knee similar to that caused by other unrelated pathological conditions within the knee. the sensation of pain and/or imminent buckling of the knee results in apprehension and restriction of certain weight bearing activities such as athletic endeavours. the resultant increased abnormal traction forces on the peripatella soft tissues frequently lead to inflammatory changes of the retinaculae, patellar ligament and/or tendon (tendinitis). furthermore, the repetitive, abnormal lateral excursions which cause abnormal shearing forces, frequently lead to early, accelerated and progressive degenerative changes (chondromalacia) of the patella and femoral condyles. as notedabove, problems peculiar to the patella compromise only a portion of all common physiological problems of the knee and several, unrelated or partially related problems may occur simultaneously, particularly in individuals having loose ligaments or when engaged in relatively strenuous activities involving the knee. physicians generally, and orthopaedic surgeons in particular, have only recently begun to fully appreciate the frequency and importance of patellar subluxation in the context of overall knee problems. accordingly, the diagnosis of patella subluxation may be difficult to ascertain using conventional techniques, especially because other problems with the knee frequently cause subjective symptoms similar to those of subluxation of the patella. not only may the proper diagnosis of patellar subluxation, particularly in its milder form, be difficult using conventional techniques, but even when properly diagnosed, the preferred treatment may be somewhat limited. for example, young children still in the active bone growth phase of life frequently are relatively loosely ligamented and suffer from

<CLAIMS>
 claims   1. a dynamic patellar brace for preventing subluxation of a patella throughout the normal range of flexion and movement of the knee characterised in that it comprises a patellar bracing pad 15, means (19) adapted to maintain said pad positioned laterally of the patella throughout the normal range of flexion and movement of the knee when the brace is in use, and means (17, 18) adapted to cause said pad positioned laterally of the patella to apply medial pressure to the patella throughout the normal range of flexion and movement of the knee when the brace is in use.   2. a dynamic patellarbrace according to claim 1 characterised in that said means adapted to cause said pad to apply pressure comprises first (17) and second (18) elastic arm members, the first end of each of which is adapted to be circumferentially wrapped in a first direction about the knee when the brace is in use, and wherein said means adapted to maintain said pad laterally positioned comprises an elastic counterarm member 19, the first end of which is adapted to be circumferentially wrapped in a   direction    opposite to the first direction about the knee when the brace is in use.   3. a dynamic patellar brace according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in that the medial side of said pad 15 adapted to be positioned laterally of the patella when the brace is in use is arcuately shaped, concave towards the patella.     4. a dynamic patella brace according to claim 2 or claim 3 characterised in that said first and second elastic arm members 17, 18 are shaped and positioned so as to be circumferentially wrapped about the knee above and below the patella,   respectively..      when the brace is in use, and wherein the second ends of each of said elastic arm members and the second end of said elastic counterarm member 19 are attached to said pad.    5. a dynamic patellar brace according to claim 2 or claims3 or 4 when appendant to claim 2, characterised in that it comprises means operably associated with said first and second arm members and with said counterarm member and adapted to secure the second ends of said circumferentially wrapped members to prevent the unwrapping of said members when the brace is in use.   6. a dynamic patellar brace according to any preceding claim   chat terised    in that it further comprises an elastic sleeve   2c    attached to said pad and adapted to receive a leg with the respective knee positioned substantially within said sleeve when the brace is in use.   7. a dynamic patellar brace according to claim 3 and claim 6 characterised in that the sleeve is provided with an aperture 21 in its side wall adjacent to the concave side of the patella.
