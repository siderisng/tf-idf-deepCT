<ABSTRACT>
a thermostatically controlled valve, of the type used in a  cooling system of an internal combustion engine, has a  temperature-responsive actuating member (30), for opening  and closing the valve, in the form of a metal coil (30) having  shape memory effect such that its modulus of elasticity  increases rapidly at a critical temperature.  the actuating  member is calibrated prior to assembly in the valve by heating  the member to the critical temperature and reducing its length  to that at which the valve will begin to open by cutting the  member whilst preventing overheating.
