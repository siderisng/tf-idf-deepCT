<ABSTRACT>
a food package is made by electron irradiating a  polyethylene coating on paper board and then forming and  heat-sealing.  surprisingly, heat-sealing is effective to allow  use of the package at temperatures above that at which the  heat-seal is formed; for example, it will withstand exposure to  an ordinary domestic radiant oven at 200Â°c for at least 30  minutes, allowing the content of the package to be cooked.   the drawing illustrates a suitable irradiation technique.

<DESCRIPTION>
packages this invention relates to packages made wholly or in part from coated paper board. it relates more specifically to food packages that are suitable for being exposed to heat, for example in an ordinary domestic oven, for the purpose of cooking the contents of the package. it is well knownwthat paviging mat4giall;si made of or coated with thermoplastic polyethylene can be formed to shape and/or enclosed by he at- sealing, that is by pressing ap-propriate parts together under heat and pressure until a bond is formed. such materials are, however, quite unsuitable for applications involving heating to temperatures above the softening point of the polyethylene. it is also well known that the heat resistance of polyethylene can be increased by subjecting it to high energy irradiation, but this has the effect of making the material infusible, and it has hitherto been assumed that such irradiated materials could not be satisfactorily heat-sealed. surprisingly, we have now discovered that electron-irradiated polyethylene-coated paper board can be heat-sealed by pressing the parts together and heating to a temperature above the softening point of the polyethylene prior to cross-linking, and moreover that the bond so formed is surprisingly strong even at temperatures higher than that at which the bond was formed. in accordance with the invention, a heat sealed food package capable of exposure to a radiant oven at 2000c for 30 minutes without leakage is made wholly or in part from paper board thinly coated on at least one side with polyethylene and irradiated with electrons, after coating but before heat sealing, to give a degree of cross-linking that results or would result from irradiation of polyethylene without any sensitiser to a dose, averaged over the thickness of the coating the range 5-50 (preferablyd#-30) mrad. the heat-sealed seam or seams may close the package in a hermetically sealed fashion, or they may simply form the material of the package to the required shape, e.g. by securing a corner or an open topped tray. preferably the (or each) coating has a weight not greater than 100g/m2. preferably the polyethylene is free of any additives, but radiation sensitisers and other additives may be present in the polyethylene provided they are suitable for use in contact with food. preferably the electrons impinging on the surface of the laminate have no more energy than is necessary (bearing in mind the angle of incidence) to give an adequately uniform dose through the thickness of the coating, and a dose that is half as great at the polyethylene/board interface as at the surface can be considered adequate. the use of high-energy electrons impinging on the laminate at glancing incidence is attractive as it offers the prospect of a high dose rate and consequently a high line speed; a particularly convenient arrangement is to inject a diverging electron beam into the open end of a parallel-sided or narrow v-shaped loop of the laminate, to give high-energy electrons at glancing incidence close to the source and low-energy scattered electrons at a

claims   1. a heat-sealed food package, capable of exposure to a radiant oven at   200 0c    for 30 minutes without leakage, made wholly or in part from paper board thinly coated on at least one side with polyethylene and irradiated with electrons, after coating but before heat-sealing, to give a degree of cross-linking with results or would result from irradiation of polyethylene without any sensitiser to a dose, averaged over the thickness of the coating, inthe range 5-50 mrad.    2. a package in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that polyethylene is free of any additives.   3. a package as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the radiation dose at the   polyeth#lene/board    interface is half as great as that at the surface of the polyethylene.   4. a method of making board for use in the package of claim 1 comprising subjecting polyethylene coated paper board to high energy electrons impinging on the coated surface of the laminate at glancing incidence.    5. a method of cooking food comprising heating  it while contained in a package claimed in any one of  claims 1 - 3 to a temperature higher than the   sortening-     point of the polyethylene before cross-linking.     6. food cooked by the method claimed in claim 5.
