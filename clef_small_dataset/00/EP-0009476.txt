<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for stacking plate-shaped objects (2) which are delivered at constant intervals by a conveying device (1), having a continuously revolving transfer device which is associated with the end of the conveying device (1) and has two mutually opposite carriers (3), which rotate synchronously about a common axis, and several plates which are mounted on these carriers to be rotatable about axes parallel to the said axis and are mutually opposite in pairs and on which pivotable claws (5) are provided which project into the space between the carriers and which grip the plate-shaped objects (2) delivered by the conveying device (1) and lift these to a table (8) on which they are stacked, the plane defined by the upper edges of a pair of mutually opposite claws (5) always being parallel to the table (8) and to the conveying device, characterized in that the carriers of the transfer device are constructed as circular discs (3) and that the plats (4) carrying the claws (5) are sunk flush in the discs (3), the distance between the discs (3) being only slightly greater than the extent of the plate-shaped objects (2, 7), as measured transversely to the conveying direction.
