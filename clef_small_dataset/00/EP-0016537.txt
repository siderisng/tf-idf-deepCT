<ABSTRACT>
an inverter power supply circuit (10,12) compensates for  variations in the power supply's output voltage (vout) which  are due to variations in output loading.  the input side of the  circuit's coupling transformer (t₁) incorporates a current  sensing network (14) having an impedance that is equivalent  to the power supply's output impedance.  variations in the  output loading cause corresponding proportional changes in  the currents passing through the load (rout) and the current  sensing network (14).  the changing current in the current  sensing network (14) on the input side of the coupling trans­ former (t₁) generates a corresponding changing voltage that  is coupled, as a positive feedback, to a chopping transistor  (q₁) of the power supply to provide compensation for chang­ ing losses following variations in loading on the output side of  the coupling transformer (t₁), without the need for a feedback  connection from the output circuit.
