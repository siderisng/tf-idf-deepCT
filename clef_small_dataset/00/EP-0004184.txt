<ABSTRACT>
catalytic gas sensors comprise a noble metal filament  onto which is applied alumina having a particle size of not  greater than 100aÂ° and a catalyst material is impregnated  into the dried alumina.  the alumina may be dried by passage  of an electric current through the filament and, prior to coating  the filament may be stabilised by coating with a thermally  decomposable aluminium salt and decomposed by  passing a pulsed electric current.
