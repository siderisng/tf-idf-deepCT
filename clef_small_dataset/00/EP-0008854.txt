<ABSTRACT>
there are provided novel pentadienone hydrazones, and  methods of use of said compounds for the control of insects,  especially lepidopterous insects, and for the control of ants,  family formicidae, especially fire ants.  the novel com­ pounds have the structure:    wherein r₁ is in the meta or para position and is selected  from the group consisting of halogen, cf₃-, chf₂cf₂o- and  chnf3-ny-; r₂ is hydrogen or r₆-c-; r₃ and r₆ may be the  same or different and are selected from c₁-c₁₇ alkyl, c₂-c₁₇  alkenyl and    and r₄ and r₅ are each hydrogen or  methyl; r₇ and r₈ are hydrogen, halogen, c₁-c₄ alkyl or  c₁-c₄ alkoxy; y is oxygen or sulfur; m is an integer selected  from 0. 1 or 2; n is an integer selected from 0 or 1, r₁₁ and  r₁₂ are each selected from y-cf₂x-, hydrogen and halo, pro­ vided that at least one but not both r₁₁ and r₁₂ is y-cf₂x-; y  is selected from hydrogen, fluorine, -chf₂ and -chcl₂; x is  oxygen or sulfur; r₁₃ and r₁₄ each are alkyl (c₁-c₄) and  when taken together they form an alkylene group of 2 to 4  carbon atoms or a methyl or dimethyl-substituted alkylene  group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms.  and inorganic acid addition  salts thereof.
