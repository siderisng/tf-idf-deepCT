<ABSTRACT>
valuable minerals or carbonacious fuels are often not  recoverable due to large quantites of presently inseparable  undesirable substances.  silica, alumina, sulphur compounds  and iron oxides often comprise the unwanted substances.   there is thus provided a process for removal of these  substances by the use of hydrogen fluoride wherein substan­ tial amounts of the hydrogen fluoride may be recovered for  recycle to make the process viable.

<DESCRIPTION>
"coal de-hshing process:' this invention relates to a process for remeving silica and/or aluminium bearing mineral matter and other reactive substances from substances which do not react with hydrogen fluoride under the same conditions. the reaction with hydrogen fluoride may be in the gaseous or liquid font. it has been known that hydrogen fluoride particul- arljr as a liquid will react with silica and dissolve same selectively from non-reactive materials such as carbonacious matter, òr example, coal. however, whilst this reaction has been known it has never been able to be put into a commercial viable process. the main reasons for this being that hydrogen fluoride is a particularly dangerous substance and any wastes produced which include hydrogen fluoride create troublesome disposal problems. furthermore, hydrogen fluoride is a very expensive material andthe known processes are not emi1.1 economically viable because they have not shown how the hydrogen fluoride may be recovered and recycled. many carbonacious materials, such as coal, oil, tar sands and oil bearing shales contain a valuable high energy component i.e., the carbonacious material, incorporated with either chemically or physically bound substances which are not desirable because they are merely ash substan- ces or create pollution problems. such undesirable substances are substantially silicon, aluminium and sulphur compounds. these components make up the major unwanted matter in coal and other carbonacious fuels. many coals contain ash contents up to 30% or even in excess of that figure. it is thus desirable that these coals have their ash contents reduced to amounts which are more acceptable to the fuel burning consumer. low ash coals and other fuels, i.e. with ash contents below 1%, are very rare and very hard to obtain by conventional methods. however, these fuels are becoming more in demand due to the need to be able to burn them directly as a pulverised coal in situations such as diesel engines, built up areas and other critical fuel burning apparatus. the conventional methods of cleaning coal such as washing are generally not satisfactory to reduce the ash content to the low lavais required for the vast majority of coal that is available. furthermore, certain elements, such as gold, a e non-reactive with regard to hydrogen fluoride. thus, einments which are unreactive vith hf under certain conditions also utilise the process of the invention for recovering from reactive associated components such as silicon, zlum- inium, sodium or other mineral matters. it is thus an object of this invention to amelior- ate the abovementioned disadvantages. in one broad form the invention provides a process for separating compounds or elements which do not react with hydrogen fluoride from elements or compounds which do react with hydrogen fluoride, and recovery for reuse of substantial amounts of the hydrogen fluoride, said process comprising: la) reacting feed material with hydrogen fluoride, (b) separating the resultant product into a gaseous stream and a solids or liquid stream, characterised in that (c) the gaseous stream is contacted with water at a temperature and pressure sufficient to
