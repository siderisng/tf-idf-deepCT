<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector for use in establishing electrical  connections between the conductors (100) of a flat, multi­ conductor cable (101) and conductors (200) carried by a subs­ trate (201), comprises a stamped and formed metal member (2)  having a plurality of reversely bent resilient fingers (4) extending  from one edge (5), and means (7) to secure the connector to the  substrate (201) with the conductors (100) of the cable (101)  urged onto the conductors (200) on the substrate (201) by the  fingers (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
electrical connector for conncting a flat cable to a substrate. this invention relates to an electrical connector, and particularly an electrical connector for use in entablishing electrical connections between the conductons of a flat rnulti-conductor electrical cable and conductors carried by a substrate. such a connector is disclosed in french patent application no. 73.14613, publication no. 2241888, which discloses a connector comprising a single member stamped and formed from sheet metal and having an elongate body portion, a plurality of rosilient contact fingers arranged in a row eztending lengthwise of the body portion, all the fingers extending in the same direction and having their longitudinal axes extending transversely of the row direction, and mounting means formed at each end of the body portion and adapted and arranged to secure the connector to a substrate with the fingers extending towards and engaging conductors carried by the substrate. for use of this known connector, exposed end portions of the conductors ot a flat multi-conductor cable comprising a plurality of parallel conductors carried by a sheet of insulating material, are clamped between he fingers and conductors on the surface of a substrate, for example a printed circuit hoard, the fingers thus serving to urge the cable conductors into engagenent with the substrate conductors respectively, to provide the roquired connections. with this known connector the fingers are arranged to point away from the edge of the substrate at which the connector is to be mounted, that is towards the cable to be connected to the substrate, and thus the connector can be mounted only at an edge of a substrate with the cable and connector being simultaneously applied to the substrate with the nounting means of the connector entering slots open to the edge of the substrate. this is because if the connector is first mounted onto the substrate without the cable, then the end of cable cannot subsequently be inserted between the fingers and the substrate since the free ends of the fingers are directed towards the cable and are in engagement with the substrate. this known connector thus has the disadvantages that as disclosed it can be used only at an edge of a substrate, and must be assembled to a substrate simultaneously with a cable, and must also be removed from the substrate en the cable is to be removed. u.s. patent spccification no. 3629787 discloses an electrical connector which serves the same purpose as the connector discussed above, and which comprises a housing of insulating manorial adapted to be secured to an end o a substrate having conductors on a surface thereof, the housing containing a contact structure stamped and formed from sheet metal and comprising a plurality of resilient fingers extending from one edge of a body portion, the fingers being reversely bent to uncer- lie the body portion. in use, the housing is secured to the substrate with c:posed end portions of the conductors of a cable as described above positioned between the conductors on the substrate and
