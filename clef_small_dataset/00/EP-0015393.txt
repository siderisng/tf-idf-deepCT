<ABSTRACT>
the arrangement features the provision in each motor  circuit of a respective break or change-over contact (21,  22, 23, 24, 21′, 22′, 23′, 24′) of a relay (15) which is ac­ tuated by a micro switch strip (19, 19′) provided along  the frame edge of the associated window (11, 12, 13, 14)  via a control apparatus (17).  the motor current can thus  be either switched off or reversed in the opposite direction  if an object is trapped between the frame edge (16) and  the window edge (18).  the specification also relates to two novel micro switch  strips (19, 19′) which are arranged on the window frame  alongside the edge of the window pane in its raised posi­ tion.

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to rhotorised actuation apparatus for' opening and closing a slidable vehicle window there being a drive motor for each driven window and an actuation switch in respect of each motor each switch having a window closing position, a window. opening position and a neutral position. actuation devices of this kind are known in many variants. they are generally actuated by means of a change-over switch arranged alongside the driver's seat so that a desired vehicle window can be either opened or closed. problems however occur with such actuation devices. for example on actuation of a window in the closure direction by the driver the finger of a passenger, in particular of a child can become trapped. this danger is particularly present if the driver actuates the window during a journey when he is required to concentrate completely on the traffic. moreover the danger exists with children that they put their heads out of the window during the journey so that on automatic closing of the respective window the head or the throat of the child could become trapped. to protect against objects becoming trapped against the closure edges of doors there already exist switch strips which extend along the associated closurè edge and, on the exertion of pressure- > via a trapped object, close a circuit which then terminates or reverses the closing operation via a control device (de-os 26 44 608 and de-os 27 19 438). it is also already known to construct the switch strip of two electrodes arranged spaced apart from each other which approach one another when loads are applied to the closure edge in the closure direction and which finally contact to initiate the control signal. the previously known protective devices are however not suitable for use on vehicle windows because in this case the closure edge of the window must be pressed with not inconsiderable pressure' against the closure edge or frame of the window opening because of the necessity to seal the window. if conventional strip switches were used this would result in the known protective device initiating a change-over signal without an object actually being trapped between-the window and frame. the principal object of the invention thus resides in providing motorised actuation apparatus of the kind'initially named in which the movement of the window will automatically be stopped or reversed when an object becomes trapped between the frame ,edge of the window opening and the closure edge of the window without however distadvantageously affecting the execution of the normal closing operation in order to accomplish this task the invention envisages in motorised actuation apparatus of the initially defined kind that, in each motor circuit, there is connected a break contact or switch-over contact of a relay which is actuated by a micro switch strip provided along the frame edge of the associated window via a control apparatus so that the motor current can-be respectively switched off or reversed in the opposite direction only when an object is trapped between
