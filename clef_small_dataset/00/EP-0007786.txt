<ABSTRACT>
in a wheel mounting a hub rotates within a steering  knuckle (2) or other carrier on a double row tapered roller  bearing (b) of the indirect configuration.  this bearing includes  a double cup (40) that is fitted into the carrier, a pair of cones  (42) (44) that are pressed over the hub (12), tapered rollers (46)  arranged in two rows between the opposed raceways of the  cup (40) and cones (42) (44), and a cage (48) for each row of  rollers (46).  the retaining ribs (62) on the cones have beveled  surfaces (64) so that as the hub (12) is withdrawn from the  steering knuckle (2), in which case one of the cones (42) will be  carried along with the hub (12), the beveled surface (64) on the  cone (42) that moves with the hub (12) will deflect the small  ends of its rollers (46) outwardly to enable the cone (42) to  pass through the rollers (46) and free itself from the cup (40)  without shearing off snap rings or similar devices that secure  the cup (40) in place.
