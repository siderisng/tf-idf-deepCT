<ABSTRACT>
The circuit comprises a digital / decoder counter (16) controlled by clock pulses from the associated data processing system (12). A comparator-amplifier (26) compares, on a cycle basis by cycle, the primary alternating power supply supplied to the rectifier / demultiplier circuit (28) at a continuous reference voltage supplying the voltage regulator (30) which provides a threshold voltage . The circuit (26) generates a restore voltage during each alternative cycle when the AC voltage exceeds the threshold voltage. If the decoder circuit detects a statement exceeding the account reached by the composition between two normally occurring restoration pulses, this circuit (16) generates a disturbing signal (PLD) supplied to the associated system (12) and a circuit of Recovery of the power supply (20) allowing it to respond consistently to a subsequent recovery of the power supply. Can be used in any data processing system to allow volatile data backup.
