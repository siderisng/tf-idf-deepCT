<ABSTRACT>
pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of  the formula (ii):    wherein r₁ is a lower alkyl group and r₂ is a lower alkyl  group optionally linked to r₁ so that the or₁ and or₂  moieties and the carbon atom to which they are attached  form a 1,3-dioxacyclohexa-2,2-diyl, 1,3-dioxacyclopenta-2,2-­ diyl or 1,3-dioxacyclohepta-2,2-diyl diradical, and a process  for their preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
pharmaceutical compositions containing a xanthine derivative the compound of the formula (i) emi1.1 was disclosed in ddr patentschrift 129911 as being a chemical intermediate but no harmacological activity was ascribed to it. it has now been found that the compound of the formula (i) and certain related compounds have similar pharmacological properties to pentoxyphilline and so may be used to promote blood flow through skeletal muscles which is desirable for the treatment of intermittant claudication. the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of the formula (ii) emi1.2 wherein r1 is a lower alkyl group and r2 is a lower alkyl group optionally linked to r1 so that the or1 and or2 moieties and the carbon atom to which they are attached form a 1,3-dioxacyclohexa-2,2-diyl, 1,3-dioxacyclo penta-2,2-diyl or 1,3-dioxacyclohepta-2,2-diyl diradical. suitable lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl and n-butyl groups. most suitably r1 and r2 both represent the same lower alkyl group or alternatively are linked. a particularly suitable acyclic value for r1 is the ethyl group. a particularly suitable acyclic value for r2 is the ethyl group. a preferred compound of the formula (ii) is that wherein r1 and r2 are linked so that the c(or1)(or2) moiety is a 1,3-dioxacyclopenta-2,2-diyl diradical. the compounds of this invention may be used to treat vascular disorders in the same manner as sentoxyphilline is used. thus for example they may be formulated into orally administrable unit dose forms that contain 100-500 mg of the compound of the formula (ii). such unit dose forms may be administered 1-4 times daily in such a manner that the daily dose for a 70 kg adult will usually be in the range 300-1500 mg per day. particuarly suitable unit dose forms are tablets and capsules. these forms will contain excipients in normal manner, for example lubricants such as magnesium stearate, disintegrants such as microcrystalline cellulose or sodium starch glycollate or the like. the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the compositions containing a compound of the formula (ii), which process comprises bringing a compound of the formula (ii) into association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier the compositions of this invention may be fabricated by conventional methods of blending, compressing, filling and the like, for example those methods known as suitable for pentoxyphilline. the compounds of the formula (ii) may be prepared by the method described in ddr patentschrift 129911. thus suitable methods comprise ketalising pentoxyfilline in conventional manner or reacting a salt of the 3,7-dimethylxanthine with ch3.c(orl).(ch2)4.cl or the like. ketalisation of pentoxyphilline may be brought about by reaction with a diol in benzene in the presence of p-toluene sulphonic and in conditions under which the water produced is removed. after about 1 day the benzene layer may be washed to remove excess diol and the benzene evaporated. acyclic ketals may be prepared by the reaction with an orthoester at ambient temperature. in this form of the process a large excess of the orthoester may be used so that
