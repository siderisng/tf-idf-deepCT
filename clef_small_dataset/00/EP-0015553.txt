<ABSTRACT>
a high-speed printer (10) includes a rotatable platen  (11) and a movable print carriage (18).  the carriage inÂ­ cludes a light-emitting diode (24) and a photo-detector (26)  which scan the platen, as the carriage moves, looking for  the edge of the paper.  the light is transmitted to and from  the platen by a pair of optical fiber bundles (32, 33) which  are randomly interspersed at their forward end to produce  a third optical fiber bundle (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for determining the position of the printing medium in a high speed printer the invention relates to a method and an apparatus for determining the position of the printing medium ill a high speed printer. igh-speed printers are widely used in industry for such diverse applications as output devices for data-processing systems, stand-alone word-processing terminals, or interactive terminals for time-sharing systems. increasingly, such printers are called upon to operate in an automatic or semi-automatic mode, that is to say, with only occasional intervention fro a human operator. for such automatic or semi-automatic operation to be completely reliable it is, of course, necessary for the printer to determine whether or not the printing medium to be used, typically a sheet of paper, has been properly fed into the printer or, if properly fed at the beginning of the print cycle, has not subsequently gone askew. if, as is often the case, the printer is typing information onto a pre-printed form, it is also important to accurately register the beginning of each print cycle with the preprinted regions of the form. heretofore, the only way to resolve these problems was to use a printer having a tractor-feed platen and sprocketed, fan-fold paper. unfortunately, this has not proven to be a satisfactory solution to the problem as the paper must subsequently be separated into individual sheets and the perforated egdes removed, all of which adds to the costs of the operation. further, the requirement that the paperusedmust be sprocketed greatly reduces the flexibility of the printer as any special paper or letterhead which a customer may wish to use is not compatible with the system and hence cannot be used. then too, use of sprocketed paper does not necessarily guarantee proper vertikal alignment as the operator may feed the paper into the machine incorrectly from the outset. what is clearly needed is a method and an apparatus for rapidly and accurately determining the position of the paper in the printer relative to the print head carriage. advantageously, the method should not be tied to the use of any particular form of paper, nor should the method be restricted to any particular type of printer. the above and other objectives are attained in the instant invention which comprises an apparatus for detecting at least one of the edges of a printing medium which is positioned proximate the platen of a printer, the printing medium and platen having differing co-efficients of reflection to incident radiant energy. the apparatus comprises means for directing a beam of radiant energy towards the platen and means for detecting any of the beam of radiant energy as is reflected off either the platen or the printing medium. the apparatus also includes means for inducing relative motion between the platen and the beam directing and beam detecting means and n;eans, responsive to the output of the beam detecting means for terminating the relative motion whenever a significant transition is detected in the output from the beam detecting means.
