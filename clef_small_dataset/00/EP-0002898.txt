<ABSTRACT>
a foundry mould or core is prepared by mixing with  a foundry aggregate a polyisocyanate, a polymeric addition  product of a phenol and a further material comprising  aromatic hydroxyl groups, forming the mixture to the  required shape and causing or permitting the polyisocyanate  to react with both the addition product and the  further material to bind the aggregate.  the addition  product may be prepared by reacting an unsaturated  hydrocarbon with a phenol.  the hydrocarbon may be  comprised by a mixture of terpenes.  the further hydroxy  material may be a bisphenol or a phenolic resin.
