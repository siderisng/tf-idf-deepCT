<ABSTRACT>
various kinds of organosilicon compounds are already known having anti-tumour activity.  their relatively strong toxicity however has impeded a wide use of such compounds in actual therapy.  the primary object of the invention is to provide a novel anti-tumor agent comprising as its therapeutically effective ingredient, an organosilicon compound having low or no toxicity.   <??>the novel compound is a (trihydrocarbylsilylmethyloxyimino) alkane, which is a silicon-containing oxime compound hitherto not described in any prior art literatures, represented by the general formula r<1>3si-ch2-o-n=y.
