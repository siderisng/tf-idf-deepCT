<ABSTRACT>
1.  piston device for pneumatic spring or other telescopic apparatus with cylinder and plunger rod, this piston device (9) being arranged for guiding the plunger rod (2) within the cylinder (1) and subdividing the latter into two chambers (a, b) intercommunicating via a channel (15) formed through the piston, which piston comprises on the one hand a sealing ring (16) which rubs against the inner wall of the cylinder (1) and on the other hand a piston body (10) slidably fitted on said plunger rod (2) between two stops (4, 7) integral therewith and at least one of which serves not only as a sliding limitator of the piston (9) but also as an obturator partially obturating the outlet of said channel (15) when the piston (9) abuts against it, characterized in that said sealing ring (16) is mounted externally of the piston body (10) in a floating manner relatively thereto, both members (10, 16) being capable of merely abutting freely against each other in order to move in unison, so that said sealing ring (16) cooperates with the corresponding limitator stop (7) to exercise the desired partial obturation function.
