<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a machine and method for setting  up and completing certain manipulative operations of the  panels of a collapsed basket style container.  a collapsed carton (c) is withdrawn by a reciprocable  feeder (10) assisted by suction means from a hopper (1) and  deposited in the path of movement of movable suction means  (4) which engages one side wall of the carton and drives the  carton towards fixed suction means (3) which in turn engages  the opposite side wall of the carton.  thereafter pivotal movement  of the movable suction means (4) in a direction away  from the fixed suction means (3) draws the carton side walls  apart and initiates setting up of the carton.  the machine is particularly well suited for use by a packager  for setting up and glueing a collapsed basket style carton of  the type which is intended for heavy duty usage and which  will not need to be collapsed after it is set up.
