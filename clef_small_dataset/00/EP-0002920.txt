<ABSTRACT>
a liquid crystal display comprises two transparent slides  (2, 3) containing a thin layer (14) of liquid crystal material  which may be nematic or cholesteric.  addressing electrode  structures (5, 6) on the inner faces of the slide allow voltages  to be applied across the layer (14) to cause an observable  display effect.  the voltage at which an observable  display occurs in temperature dependent.  in this invention  sensing electrodes (12, 13) are connected in series with a  reference impedance (zf).  with a constant supply voltage  (vo) across the sensing electrodes (12, 13) and reference  impedance (zf) the voltage (vlc) developed between the  sensing electrodes (12, 13) varies with temperature of the  liquid crystal layer (14).  this voltage (vlc) variation is  used to control the voltages applied to the addressing  electrodes (5, 6) to compensate for temperature variations  in the layer (14).
