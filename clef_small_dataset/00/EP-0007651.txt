<ABSTRACT>
a method of connecting two pipe sections, each having  an external thermal insulating coating by inserting an un­ coated male end which is connected with one of said sections  and which is provided with a sealing ring at its free extremity  into the other section wherein it is fitting with some clearance  and by filling the space between at least the other pipe section  and the male end and simultaneously the entire space bet­ ween the insulating coating of both pipe sections with the  same liquid thermosetting synthetic resin.  pipe connection made by applying said method.

<DESCRIPTION>
applicant: ketch b.v. of hoogezand short title: a method of connecting two insulated pipe sections and pipe connection. the invention relates to a method of connecting two pipe sections each having an external thermal insulating coating by inserting an uncoated male end which is connected with one of said sections into the other section in which it is fitting with some clearance and by applying an adhesive between the male end and pipe sections as well as between the insulating coatings. a method of this kind is known from the us specification 3 402 731, according to which for connecting the pipe section and the male end fitting therein a suitable adhesive is used while the adjacent faces of the insulating coatings are provided with a suitable mastic. this method is cumbrous and moreover does not safeguard against liquid running through the pipe sections or liquid surrounding the insulated pipe sections, such as soil water, does penetrate into the insulating coating through possible incomplete sealings. the invention provides a method of the kind set forth, which is easily applicable and additionally gives a reliable sealing of the insulating coating which method is characterised in providing the male end at its free end with an elastic sealing ring an @@@@@@@@@@@@@@ anto the other pipe section in simultaneously g c the space between at least one pipe section and the male end and the entire space between the insulating coating of both pipe sections with a liquid thermosetting synthetic resin. in this manner at any position in > pipe system connections can be made by sawing the respective pipe sections to the required length and subsequently connecting same to that end preferably the male end at tne one pipe section is formed by partly inserting a piece c pipe without coating and having a smaller outer diameter than the inner diameter of that pipe section and being provided at each extremity with a sealing ring into said pipe section, thereafter the above method can be followed. for several reasons using a male end having centring projections may be advisable: filling the space to be filled with synthetic resin is more reliable, the several pipe sections are mutually centered and when using a separate piece of pipe as male end the riht inserting depth is guaranteed and accordingly preferably a male end is used having a row of spacers being distributed over the periphery, the extremities of which spacers describing a circle having a diameter in excess of the inner diameter of the tube sections and describing at a point more toward the free end of the male end a circle just fitting in the pipe sections the invention also relates to a pipe connection comprising two pipe secions each having an external thermal insulating coating and a male end being inserted into one or both pipe sections.a pipe connection of the kind set forth is as well as a method of making it is known from the us specification 3 402 731
