<ABSTRACT>
light curtain generating apparatus incorporating a  cyclical scale features a light source (19) for directing a beam  of light to a mirror wheel (22) located substantially at the focus  of a strip-like concave mirror (23) and which is adapted to  deflect the beam through a variety of angles into the concave  mirror to generate a moving scanning beam traversing the  image space of the concave mirror and forming said light  curtain.  a beam divider (27) is arranged to intercept the  scanning beam and to divide off and direct a part of the  scanning beam to a cyclical scale generator (14) which  features a light conducting rod (11) with a photoelectric  detector (12) at at least one end thereof and a cycle scale (14)  which extends substantially parallel to the light conducting  rod and which modulates the light fraction passed from the  divided off part of the scanning beam to the photoelectric  detector to modulate the output signal therefrom.  the cycle  scale can conveniently comprise a bar pattern placed in front  of the light conducting rod or a series of spaced apart inclined  mirrors (16) at the rear side surface of the light conducting rod.  in an alternative embodiment the light conducting rod is  replaced with a number of diodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to light curtain generating apparatus incorporating a cyclical scale *generator, light curtain generating apparatus is customarily used to direct a beam of light which is continuously and periodically displaced sideways substantially parallel to itself through a region or at a surface to light receiving apparatus for the purpose of monitoring the region or surface. the light receiving 'arrangement conveniently provides a signal when any irregularity is determined such as an obstruction of the region or the presence of a hole or other imperfection in the surface. it is frequently necessary to establish not only that such an obstruction or imperfect.ion is prasent -in the monitored region but also to establish'its position. for this purpose it is necessary to know the position of the scanning beam at the time the obstruction or imperfection is detected and this is conveniently achieved by means of a cyclical scale generator which produces signals in synchrony with the movement of the scanning beam from which the instantaneous position of the scanning beam can be readily derived. in a typical arrangement the light curtain generating apparatus comprises a transmitter part which genex.ate from a light source a light bead in a scanning plane, a light deflecting arrangement which is usually constructeia as a mirror wheel and a strip-like concave mirror with the surface of. the mirror wheel on which the light bead fa'lls located substantially at the focus of the concave mirror t,e scanning beam generated in the image space of ths concave mirror is directed through a corresponding strip-]like light outlet window and a cyclical scale extends along the light outlet window and is scanned by a part of the scanning beam. the scanning beam then passes via a scanning plane or a retroreflector to a photoelectric light receiving arrangement which detects and convert into a corresponding electrical signal the light reaching the scanning plane or reflected from the retroreflector. the arrangement is completed by a -further photoelectric detector which receives light from the cycle scale. it is however customary in known arrangements to return the light beam formed from that part of the scanning beam which falls on the cycle scale by autocollimation or quasiautocollimation back via the mirror wheel and then to reflect it out of the transmitted beam by a beam divider or deflecting mirror and then to pass it to the associated photoelectric detector. the cyclical scale generator is thus optically coupled via the scanning wheel with the light transmitter which places restrictions on the optical arrangement andÂ¯givesrise to other disadvantages. the principal object of the present invention is thus to provide a light curtain generating apparatus incorporating a cyclical scale of the kind generally described above in which the light beam from the cycle scale need not be passed back via the mirror wheel but can instead, if required without the aid of the strip-l.ike concave mirror, be received by a simply constructed photodetector. for accomplishing this object there is provided in accordance with a first aspect
