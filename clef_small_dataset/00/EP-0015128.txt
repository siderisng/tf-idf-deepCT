<ABSTRACT>
a hose assembly which comprises at least two electrical  conductors (22,31) which extend along a hose (41) and  through an end fitting (54) molded on to an end portion of the  hose, characterised by an insert (20) within said end fitting,  the insert comprising an insulating base portion lying radially  inwardly of the conductors, and an insulating partition portion  (23) between said two conductors, the conductors passing  through the insert and being fusion bonded thereto where  they pass through it, and the insert being fusion bonded  within the end fitting.  a method of making such a hose  assembly is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
hose assembly and method of making it it is known from the prior art to mold integral hose connectors at opposite ends of the hose having electrical components embedded therein. such hose assemblies and methods for providing same are described and illustrated in u.s. patents 3,928,715; 3,733,697 and 3,636,285. these prior art molded on end fittings and hose assemblies employ two reinforcing wires coated with a thermoplastic insulating material. the wires in addition to reinforcement serve as electrical conductors and carry electrical energy for use at a point on the hose assembly. insulated wire is placed so that one helix is parallel with the other and an extruded thermoplastic sleeve covers and is bonded to the insulated conductive wire helix. wires at each end of the hose are stripped to their insulation thus exposing bare conductive wire. thereafter female members or male pins are soldered or mechanically attached with a crimped splice to each end of the hose. a core is then inserted into each end of the hose and the hose ends are placed into an injection mold conforming to a pre-designed configuration. the female members and male pins are located in a position so that a complete electrical circuit is provided after molding of the end connectors. a thermoplastic material compatible with the hose material is injected into the mold cavity after which the assembly is water cooled to provide a hose assembly with molded on end connectors in an integral hose assembly. thus a current carrying hose assembly with molded on end fittings is provided in a one; stage injection molding process. although this design has enjoyed widespread use in the industry, its use inherently involves certain disadvantages and problems. for example, in employing a one stage process, the wires are subject to movement i.e., they are not immobilized, they are not kept separated, thus exposing the current carrying wire on its inside periphery to a metal wand which is inserted into the end fitting. this creates a very unfavorable and unsafe condition which might result in shortcircuiting. since the wires are found to be unstable in these fittings, unacceptable high reject rates result in the manufacture of these units. electrical properties of these end fittings can only be tested after the one stage injection process is performed. thus, if electrical properties are found to be unsatisfactory, the unit must be discarded. it is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved current carrying flexible hose and assembly with molded on end fittings devoid of the abovenoted deficiencies. a further object of this invention is to provide a novel current carrying flexible hose and assembly which employs current carrying wires that are and remain effectively separated during usage so as to avoid shorting. yet another object of this invention is to provide a method and means for supplying an improved current carrying hose and assembly that may be manufactured commercially with substantially lower reject rates than presently being experienced. still another object of this invention
