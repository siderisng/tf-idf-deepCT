<ABSTRACT>
a method and device for compensating on looms in running condition the effect of variable moments acting on movable component part members of such looms.  the method consists in generating a variation of the moment of inertia of at least one rotating mass mechanically linked to the movable component part members, the variations being in operative and time correlation with the variable moments.  the device consists in a compensator comprising two masses arranged radially and symmetrical to each other, the masses being displaceable radially and symmetrically to each other and arranged to follow while rotating the profile of a cam through a rolling contact wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a rotating inertial compensator, for compensating abrupt angular velocity and torquf variations in looms. the .problem posed by velocity variations in moving masses of a loom and by the forces and moments corniected therewith is a ftrndamental one in the design x elnd. construction of lo oms. that problem has different aspects which are, in a way, peouliar to each machine type. however, there exist some significant aspects of it which are more frequently recurrent and may be dealt with in a more generalized manner. this invention is concerned above all with those accelerations and forces associated therewith which occur periodically during the working cycle of a machine, and especially with a transient, often pulsive, character within the cycle, and in general departing from the uniform and sinusoidal pattern which most ideally suits a machine. typical examples of-this mode of operation are all the piston or link motion machines, textile looms with their accessories such as dobbies and jaequards, rectilinear stroke machine tools such as punching presses, shaping machines, or slotting machines, to name but a few and give a better picture of the problem without any attempt at a complete classification. it is general practice, and one that has proved quite useful, in dealing with energy balances and motion equations, to reduce all of the concurring masses set to motion, and all of the forces and couples applied thereto, to a single reference axle which can well be the motor shaft, or any main drive shaft, as is the case with looms, and to which a conventional angular velocity t) is attributed becoming also the angular velocity of the reduced masses. as is known, the reduction operation leaves unaltered the works of the forces and moments, as well as the kinetic energies of the moving masses, whether the latter's motion is originally rectilinear or rotary. by denoting with m'm, m'r and m'p the total comprehensive moments, respective ly of the driving forces, useful resistances, and passive resistances, as reduced to the reference shaft, and with the the sllm of the moments of inertia of the various moving masses, also reduced to the reference shaft, and by equating the work of the moments for a differential rotation dko=()ydt of the shaft to the corresponding kinetic energy variation, the following basic dynamic emi2.1 in several cases, i' is constant, or may be considered such in practice, because there are no masses which associate and dissociate themselves with the system, or vary their radius of rotation during the operational steps, thereby equation (1) may be simplified emi2.2 this differential equation qtiantifies the otherwise intintive notion that if the moments do not balance out at each instant, there will occur @ variation of angular velocity which is greater the smaller is the total equivalent moment of inertial'. from equation (2), as the latter is usually written, it appears that, to limit the velocity variations, two separate courses may be taken: a) to act on the motor system m'm such
