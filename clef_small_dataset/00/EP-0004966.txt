<DESCRIPTION>
exothermic polymerization in a vertical fluid bed reactor system containing cooling means therein and apparatus therefore. background of the invention this invention relates to a continuous low pressure gas phase process for the production of solid particulate polymers during an exothermic polymerization reaction in a uniform diameter vertical fluidized bed reactor system which process comprises feeding a polymerization catalyst and a gaseous stream containing at least one polymerizable monomer to a fluidized bed of polymer particles and removing the exothermic heat of reaction by indirect cooling means in the reactor and removing dry particulate polymer. also, this invention relates to a uniform diameter vertical fluidized bed reactor system containing an indirect cooling means in the reactor. descridtlon of the prior art u.s. patents 4,011,382 and 4,003,712 describe a gas phase fluid bed process for preparing olefin polymers in the presence of a high activity catalyst. specifically, u.s. patent 4,011,382 discloses that low density polyethylene can be produced commercially at pressures of < 1000 psi in a gas phase reaction in the absence of solvents by employing selected chromium and titanium (and, optionally, fluorine) containing catalysts under specific operating conditions in a fluid bed process. the fluid bed reactor is preferably described in said patents as a vertical reactor having a cylindrical lower section and an upper section having a cross section greater than that of said lower section which upper section is described as a velocity reduction zone. in the fluidization process, the portion of the gas stream which does not react in the fluidized bed constitutes the recycle stream, which is removed from the polymerization zone by passing it into said velocity reduction zone located above the bed. in the velocity reduction zone, the velocity of the recycle stream is reduced, allowing entrained particles to fall back into the bed. particle removal from the recycle stream may be aided by a cyclone. the use of a velocity reducing zone and a cyclone was believed necessary to prevent the fine particles entrained in the gas from being carried into the recycle system where they build up and cause pluggage of the heat exchanger. in a fluid bed reactor with an upper velocity reduction zone of cross section greater than that of the lower bed section, the upper and lower sections are connected by a transition section having sloped walls. when using such a fluid bed reactor, a portion of the fine particles entrained by the gas in the polymerization zone of the lower section and separated from the recycle stream in the velbcity reduction zone, fall onto tlle sloped walls of the transitiorj section. these fine particles build up over a period of time. since the fine particles contain active catalyst, they react with the monomer present in the recycle, forming solid sheets which can grow until they block recycle gas flow or slide off the sloped walls of the transition section of the reactor and into the polymerization zone. in the polymerization zone, these sheets block the flow of
