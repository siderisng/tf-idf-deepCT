<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a composite structure that can serve as well as a conductive band and door electrode for an isolated and self-aligned door-to-door transistor. It also relates to the method of manufacturing this structure. Such a transistor can be obtained by the following steps: Successive deposit on the door insulation, a first polysilicon layer (22), a layer of a non-conductive metal (24) capable of forming a silicide such as molybdenum, and a second layer of polysilicon (26); Then a stages of photolithography to delimit the electrode according to a selected configuration, and finally a heating step for reacting the metal with the polysilicon and transform it into silicide. The heating step can be performed in an oxidizing atmosphere for converting a portion of the polysilicon layer (26) into silicon dioxide. The transistor can be used in memory cells to a single device.
