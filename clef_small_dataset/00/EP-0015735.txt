<ABSTRACT>
a composite frozen confection product having ice con­ fection material in contact with a layer of fat-based coating  confection comprising a suspension of flavouring and sweet­ ening solids in a fat component, characterised in that the fat  component of the coating confection has:   (a) a solids content index in each of the following ranges:   70-93% at -20°c   65-93% at -10°c;   55-90% at 0°c;   15-40% at 20°c;   0-12% at 30°c;   and 0% at 40%;   (b) a slip melting point in the range 23°c to 32°c;   (c) a viscosity at 40°cη₁₀₀ of at least 35 centipoise, and a  viscosity at 40°ηca of at least 30 centipoise; and in that the  coating confection contains 30-70% by weight of the fat com­ ponent and has a viscosity at 40°c of η₃ at least 25 poise; η₁₀₀  at least 2. 0 poise and ηca at least 2. 2 poise.
