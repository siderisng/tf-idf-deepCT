<ABSTRACT>
a cladding layer of a relatively low refractive index glass  (4) is formed around a core member composed of one or  more relatively high refractive index glasses (1, 2, 3) by  simultaneously drawing the core and cladding glasses from  separate reservoirs of molten glass.  one or more of the  glasses (1, 2, 3) contains a refractive-index-controlling  dopant which is capable of migrating between the core  member (1, 2, 3) and cladding layer (4) at elevated temperaÂ­ tures.  a glass diffusion layer (3) is provided between the  cladding layer (4) and the core member (1, 2), and is formed  of a molten glass (3) having a lower refractive index than the  glass forming the cladding layer (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
title a method of making glass optical waveguides or waveguide blanks the present invention relates to the production of optical waveguides or optical waveguide blanks or preforms directly from molten glass. although present commercial high-bandwidth optical waveguide filaments are produced by processes involving the chemical vapor deposition of glass waveguide components to form pure waveguide blanks or preforms, it has also been proposed to produce such products by direct drawing from molten glass. hence, u.s.a. patent no. 3,726,656 describes an updrawing process for producing glass-clad glass rod which can be used as a blank or preform for redrawing optical waveguide filaments, while u.s.a. patents nos. 3,941,474, 3;791,806 and 4,032,313 describe the manufacture of glass clad glass waveguide filaments by direct down-drawing from nested multiple crucibles cr reservoirs of molten glass. the direct drawing of optical waveguides from molten glass produced by a chemical vapor deposition process is described in u.s;a. patent no. 4,065,280, while published german application no. 2,614,631 describes the production of multilayer optical waveguides by an updraw process. do@ten glass @@@@@@@ @@@@@@@ bave been proposed for the manuracture of both @tep@@n@ex and graded-index optical waveguides. @@ the @ase @f step-index waveguides, only two crucibies @r @ther reservoirs of molten glass are @@eded. @@se @@ @@n@en@rically positioned so that @ @@eiativ@@@ @@@ @e@ra@tive index glass for the vavequide cladding layer is drawn from an outer reservoir and formed around a relatively high refractive index glass for the waveguide core which is simultaneously ora'4n @rom an inner reservoir in tne case or <rti id=2.15> . gradedindex waveguide, multiple crucibles or reservoirs of molten glass are used, it the glass in the outer reservoir forming the optical waveguide cladding layer and the glasses in te inner reservoirs forming a core group which ultimately becomes the core member of the optical waveguide. glasses which increase step-wise in refractive index from the periphery of the core group to the center thereof are used to approximate the para@olic core index proxile which is desirable for high waveguide bandwidth. the refractive indices of the giasses forming the core and cladding layers in the multiple crucible assembly are controlled through the use of additives, termed dopants, which typically act to raise the refractive index of a lass in which they are dissolved to an extent proportional to their concentration therein (although dopants which reduce refractive index are also known) at the elevated tem@eratu@es employed for the direct drawing of waveguides or waveguide blanks from molten glass, these refractive-index-controlling dopants tend @@ diffuse or migrate @ro@ one glass layer to another. this had not seen considered to me objectionable since the effect is to smooth the refractive index profile in the core group and thus to better approximate the parabolic index distribution necessary for high bandwidth. however, one disadvantageous effect of dopant migration during the manufacture of optical waveguide filaments or blanks or molten glass is the migration which occurs between the outermost core members and the cladding layer. this core/cladding diffusion of dopants results in diffusion
