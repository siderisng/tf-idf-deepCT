<ABSTRACT>
specialty bread products prepared from yeast-­ leavened dough have enhanced taste and appearance and  have extended shelf life.  the products are prepared by  incorporating sorbic acid into the dough prior to baking  and then spraying with potassium sorbate.  it has been  found that such a combination affords results not predict­ able from results afforded by only adding sorbic acid to  the dough or by only spraying the surface with potassium  sorbate.

<DESCRIPTION>
specialty jread product containing preservative and method of preparing same background of the invention research has recently revealed an increasing number of health hazards associated with toxins produced by molds that may grow on bakery products. the findings of such research has increased consumer concern for food quality. no longer are molds thought to be harmless or that they may even be beneficial. further, rising costs make discarding of moldy or spoiled bakery products particularly undesirable. food processors are therefore expanding their efforts t find acceptable ways of preserving foo naturalness and freshness while using a minimum number of preservatives. - accordingly, there is a need in the baking industry for maintaining freshness with better flavor retention, increasing health safety factors, lowering operating costs from fewer returns of products not sold during a period of top quality, making the quality of foods consistent and lowering the energy usage as deliveries can be made at longer time intervals. in particular, there is a need for a preservative in yeast-leavened bakery products which fulfills the above objectives and yet does not inhibit the action of the yeast in the dough recipe. prior art the use of sorbic acid and its salts, such as calcium sorbate and potassium sorbate, as preservatives in foods has been knon for many years. for example, it is known that preservatives such as sorbic acid, propionates and vinegar have been used to inhibit mold gorwth in yeast-leavened bakery products (d. pfefer, bakers digest, april, 1976, pp. 32-37). further, the uses and mechanisms of the action of sorbic acid in inhibiting mold and fungus growth in bakery products and many other foods are known, i.e., the greater effectiveness of sorbic acid versus benzoates or propionates; the non-impairment of flavor by sorbic acid and combinations of sorbic acid with propionates [d. melnick et al., bakers digest, october, 1956, pp. 46-54 and 65; food research, 21, 133 (1956)]. mold inhibition in bread has been effected by incorporation of calcium propionate in the dough and thereafter wrapping the bread in paper treated with sorbic acid (y. pomeranz et al., bull. res. counc. israel, volume 66, 1958, pp. 220-226). the use of sorbic acid and potassium¯sorbåate in low levels in yeast-raised bakery products such' as rolls and english muffins is known. the acid 'and its 'salts have been added to the dough or applied to the surface' of the baked product (c. desa, bakers digest, december 1966, volume 40, no. 6). u.s. patent 2,997,394 describes the use of fungistats, such as sorbic acid, in yeast-raised baked goods. u.s. patent 3,692,534 describes a method of preserving food products, including''bread dough, by treatment thereof with a combination of materials including sorbic acid and potassium sorbate. u.s. patent 3,934,045 describes a-process for preserving bakery products by adding coarsely crystalline sorbic acid to the dough. u.s. patent 3,996,386 describes a method for preventing microbial surface deterioration of foods by spraying the surface thereof with a preservative such as sorbic acid and its salts. it is quite'clear thatsorbates,

 claims    1. a specialty bread, prepared from yeastleavened dough containing sorbates, characterized by having sorbates on the surface thereof, said sorbates being selected from sorbic acid, potassium sorbate and calcium sorbate.    2. bread of claim 1 characterized in that said sorbates in the dough is sorbic acid and said sorbates.on the surface thereof is potassium sorbate.    3. bread of claim 1 characterized in that it is an english muffin having from about 0.01% to about 0.5% by weight of sorbic acid in the dough and from about 0.02% to about 0.4% by weight potassium sorbate on the surface thereof.    4. bread of claim 2 characterized in that the concentration of sorbic acid is from about   0.01%    to about 0.5% based on flour weight.    5. bread of claim 2 wherein the concentration of potassium sorbate is from about 0.02% to about 0.4%.    6. bread of claim 2 wherein the concentration of potassium sorbate is from about 0.2% to about 0.3%.     7. bread of claim 1 wherein said sorbates in the dough is potassium sorbate and said sorbates on the surface thereof is sorbic acid.    8. a method of preparing a specialty bread having extended shelf-life and enhanced taste and appearance characterized by adding sorbates to yeast-leavened dough and depositing sorbates on the surface thereof prior to or subsequent to baking, said sorbates being selected from sorbic acid, potassium sorbate and calcium sorbate.    9. method of claim 8 characterized in that a weight concentration of about 0.01% to about 0.5% of sorbic acid is added to the dough and a weight concentration of from about 0.02% to about   0.4%    of potassium sorbate is deposited on the surface thereof.    10. method of claim 9 characterized in that the weight concentration of potassium sorbate is from 0.2% to 0.3%
