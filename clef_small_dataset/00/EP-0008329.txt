<ABSTRACT>
The device is essentially composed of two similar connectors and an intermediate connector on each side of which the connectors come together.When the fitting (8) is introduced into the housing (4), the sleeve (5) is repulsed and the free end of the optical fiber (1) penetrates into the flare (9) of the connector (8) where it isis guided.The fitting (8) comprises a flange (10) whose half thickness E corresponds to the length of the portion of the fiber (1) exceeding the surface 5 of the housing (4).In this way, when the fitting (8) is completely embossed in the housing (4) the end of the fiber (1) is exactly disposed in the median plane of the fitting (8), and then is in contact with the end.the fiber of the other connector in which the fitting is fitted in a similar manner.The invention applies in particular to the transmissions of information by optical fibers.
