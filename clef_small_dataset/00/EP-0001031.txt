<ABSTRACT>
Electric key switch in which the changes of electrical conduction states properly cause abruptly during the maneuver of the key.The switch comprises a coupled key (1) connected through a sudden buckling compression spring (17) to a control element (11) mounted to switch according to the position of the key between two positions inwhich it cooperates respectively with the contacts (10a and 10b or 10a and 10c).The RES comes (17) is mounted between the key (1) and the element (11) in a precompression state which ensures the maintenance of the element (11) in one of its positions until the N 'keyis not depressed.The seat (16) of the spring on the key is inclined to determine a single direction of buckling of the spring when pressing the key.Switch usable for opening and / or iron muture of one or more electrical circuits.
