<ABSTRACT>
the multilayered products essentially contain, as adhesion- promoting layer, an ethylene-alkyl acrylate copolymer which contains, in copolymerised form, from 15 to 80% by weight of an alkyl acrylate having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical.  the copolymer may optionally contain additives up to a concentration of 45% by weight, based on the adhesion-promotion layer.  the copolymer has a melt flow index at 190 deg c and 2. 16 kp (din 53 735) of from 1 to 40 g/10 min.    the softening point of the adhesion-promoting layer is in the range from 125 to 140 deg c (din 1995, ring and ball), and is matched to the softening point of the thermoplastics to be bonded, such as olefins, styrene homopolymers or copolymers, or optionally impact-modified representatives, and other thermoplastics, such as pvc, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyvinyl alcohol and/or polyurethanes.
