<ABSTRACT>
1.  a building unit comprising a rectangular floor platform (6) exclusively carried by a single foundation base (1) comprising for this purpose, in its upper part, four anchoring regions (3) disposed at the corners of a horizontal rectangle whose dimensions are distinctly less than those of said platform, and a roof platform (8) having the same shape and dimensions as the floor platform (6) and supported by a vertical tubular post disposed in vertical alignment with the base and rigid with the floor platform (6), characterised in that the rectangular floor platform (6) which carries the post (7) is exclusively supported by a rectangular and horizontal subjacent stiffening frame the two dimensions of which are less than those of the floor platform (6) and which is itself rigidly fixed to the foundation base (1) in such manner as to adjust its height relative to the four anchoring regions (3) which define a rectangle relative to which the frame (5) and the floor platform (6) are centred, said rectangle having in the longitudinal direction of the frame a dimension less than the length of the latter.
