<ABSTRACT>
a method of operating a fluidized bed system in a single  vessel, typically as a combustor system for power or steam  generation burning high-sulfur coal or as a gasifier for  high-sulfur coal, which comprises forming an entrained  fluidized bed in a first space region containing a first solid  bed particle component, such as sand or hematite ore  containing over 90% fe₂o₃, forming in a limited space region  partially within the first region a dense fluidized bed  containing a second solid bed particle component, such as  larger particles of the hematite, effecting division of the  dense fluidized bed into upper and lower zones, providing a  recirculation path such as through a cyclone separator and  particle reservoir for the first particle component from the  first space region through the upper zone of the dense  fluidized bed in the more limited space region, operating the  fluidized bed system at a velocity such that the second  component particles are effectively retained in the dense  fluidized bed in the more limited space region, whereas the  first component particles recirculate and interpenetrate  through the upper zone thereof commingling with the  second component particles, and maintaining different temperatures  in the upper and lower zones of the dense fluidized bed.
