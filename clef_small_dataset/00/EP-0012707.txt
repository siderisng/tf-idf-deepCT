<ABSTRACT>
the disclosure relates to a hydraulic mechanism, con­ trolled from the vehicle that effectively allows lifting the  vehicle wheels, one side at a time, or the four at the same  time, and to then impart a lateral displacement to the ve­ hicle.  the support means include lateral pairs of wheels (18)  which are transversally positioned to the vehicle and have  self-propelling means (17, 19) in order to park a car by  aligning it with the empty space and actuating the system  the vehicle will then displace itself into the space without  the need of operating the steering wheel.  the system com­ prises a hydraulic pump (3), operationally connected to a  liquid reservoir (2), and connected to a distribution box (5)  that include a set of actionable derivative valves (10, 11)  which supply liquid flow to pairs of vertically positioned  hydraulic pistons (13), secured by fixing means to each of  the lateral sides of the vehicle, and adjacent to the vehicle  wheels (20), the descending steps (15) of said pistons being  provided with shaft boring pillow-blocks (16) having be­ tween them an axis (17) for each side, each piston having  mounted thereon pairs of transversely positioned reduced  diameter wheels each axis being provided with power  means (19, 23-27) capable of imparting a rotational move­ ment thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
description: background of the invention th7s invention relates to a vehiole autoelevator and lateral dislacer mechanism, and is of particular application to all motor vehicles. multiple advantages are inherent in this invention. it is well known that, except for persons endowed with extreme dexerity acquired through long experience, the parking of automobiles between parked vehicles offers a degres of difficulty when the available space is only slightly larger than the width of the vehicle to be parked. this circumstance requires a large number of manoevers in order to position the vehicle in the intended space. the manoeuvers are almost impossible for weaker drivers because, if the operated vehicle in large, since most of the operations involving turning of the wheels have to be made with a stationary vehicle, considerable effort and strength on the part of the driver is required. in other cases, even when the operation may not be complicated, a heavy stream of traffic may impade carying on the maneuvers the subject mechanism not only efficintly solves the above mentioned difficulties, but also includes an automatic jack that may, if desired, litt the four wheels of the car at the same time, objects of the invention the principal object of this invention is to provode a mechanism, permanently incorporated in a motor vehicle, which allows the vehicle's partial or total elevation, in other words, lt can ralse the motor vehicle vertically at the tour wheels at the same time, another principal object of the invention includes the feature that a fully elevated motor vehicle may be iaterally displaced by power means which may be either the vehicle's own motor means or any other power means as in the case of an electric or pneumatic motor activated by the vehicles own motor. summary the subject matter relates to a hydraulic mechanism, controlled from the vehicla, that effectively allows lifting the vehicle wheels, one side at a time, or the four at the same timer and to then tmpart a lateral displacement to the vehicle. the support means include lateral pairs of wheels which are transversally positioned to the vehicle and have self-proppelling means, in order to park a car by allioning it whith the empty space and actuatlng the echanism the vehfcle will then displace itself into the space whithout the need of operating the steering wheel. the mochanism comprises a hvdraulic pump, operationally connected to a liqid reservoir, and connected to a distribution box that inoludes a set of actionable derivative valves whioh supply llauld flow to palrs of vertlcally posttioned hydraullc plstons, secured by fixing means to each of the lateral sides of the vehicle, and adjacent to the vehicle wheels, the descending stens of said pistons beins provided whith shaft borins piliow-blocks having between them a axïs for each side, each piston having mounted thereon paris of transversally positioned reduced diamete, wheels adjacent to the said vehicle wheels, eac axis being provided whith power means capable of imparting a rotational movement thereto, brief description of the
