<ABSTRACT>
1.  a wall element (1) consisting of one or several layers with a visible outside and a rear as well as connecting profiles, which preferably consist of steel plate, along the vertical edges for the connection of juxtaposed wall elements, the connecting profiles of a connection being different in design in the manner of parts complementing one another in a plug connection and comprising detent parts (11, 12, 11a, 12a) which, as they are detented, resiliently engage one behind the other in the lateral direction, characterized in that each wall element (1) has similar connecting profiles on the two vertical edges, and in that the detent parts (11, 12, 11a, 12a) of the connecting profiles have contact surfaces which are held in abutting contact in the detented state by an elastic insert (13) between the connecting profiles.
