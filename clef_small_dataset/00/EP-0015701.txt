<ABSTRACT>
the present invention is directed to improved coated film  products comprising essentially a film substrate having a dry  continuous adherent coating thereon formed from certain col­ loidally stable polymer latexes.  in particular, such polymers  comprise vinylidene chloride multipolymers with a relatively  low ph (from 0. 90 up to 0. 95) which are coated upon the sur­ face of an oriented polyacrylonitrile film which has been corona  discharge treated prior to coating.  such coated film products  exhibit improved resistance to seal strength deterioration or  complete failure when the coated film products, after having  been sealed, are immersed in water at room temperature or  above including boiling water.
