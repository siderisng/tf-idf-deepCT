<ABSTRACT>
a rotating kiln or cooler for use in the manufacture of  cementitious materials comprises a tubular body (1)  mounted for rotation about the longitudinal axis thereof, a  material being fed into the body at one end and removed at  the other end.  air or combustion gases flow through the  body (1) in the opposite direction to the material.  in order to improve heat transfer between the material  and the air or gases, at least one ring (12) of lifting members  (34) is provided on the interior periphery of the body (1).  the  members (34) lift the material and allow it to drop back to the  bottom of the kiln, thus increasing the surface area of the  material in contact with the air or gases.
