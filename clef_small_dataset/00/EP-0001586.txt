<ABSTRACT>
An integrated semiconductor device with vertical, complementary transistors consists of a epitaxy layer (18) divided into by ISO lioning zones (26) in first areas for NPN transistors and second regions for PNP transistors on a P substrate (10), wherein in each Area a buried N⁺ zone (20) is present. The NPN transistor housed in the first region comprises the buried N⁺ zone (20) as a subcollector, a N⁺δ collector terminal zone connecting with the surface, a P-base zone (36) brought into the epitaxial layer (18) and a This introduced N⁺ emitter zone. The PNP transistor accommodated in the second region comprises a P-emitter zone (32) introduced by ion implantation in the boundary area between the epitaxial layer (18) and buried N⁺ zone (20), a P-emitter terminal zone of a N⁺ base terminal zone in which the base zone Fine epitaxial layer (18) and a metal contact forming on the epitaxial layer (18), forming metal contact (60). The buried N⁺ zone (20) with a corresponding N⁺ terminal zone can here with the P substrate (10) form a blocking, ie insulating transition. In the preparation, P-based zone of the NPN transistor and P-emitter terminal zone of the PNP transistor can also be the N⁺ connecting zones to the buried N⁺ zones of both transi stors and close the N⁺-emitter zone of the NPN transistor and the N⁺-base terminal zone of the PNP transistor in each case in a process step.
