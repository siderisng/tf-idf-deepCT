<ABSTRACT>
the precise positioning of a component such as an  engine bedplate (5) in a ship under construction is pre­ determined by making height measurements on the bed­ plate at a number of support positions before the bedplate  is installed.  a sighting line (abcdef) is established rela­ tive to the tank top (4) of the ship under construction by  an optical sighting method and an optical sweep is made  in a plane parallel to this sighting line to measure the dis­ tances from the sighting line of each of the bedplate sup­ port positions on the tank top so as to predetermine the  height of individual bearing elements for the engine bed­ plate.  similar techniques are employed to establish the  fore-and-aft and athwartships positioning of the engine  bedplate before its installation.  the positioning of machi­ nery in the ship can therefore be predetermined accurately  without all the ancillary components having to be in place,  and with minimal in situ adjustment.

<DESCRIPTION>
positional setting of constructional components this invention relates to marine or building construction and in particular to the pre-alignment of components of a ship or building under construction. in ship construction the traditional methods of alignment of machinery and shafting in a ship require all the requisite components to be installed in the ship before final alignment can be achieved. alignment of a propeller shaft with an engine is achieved by first establishing a line of sight, either optically or using piano wire, then boring out the stern frame in which the aft end of the propeller shaft is eventually supported. this is followed by machining and fitting of a stern tube and a propeller and shafting which are supported in the stern tube, and finally coupling the forward end of the propeller shaft with coupling flanges on the engine drive shaft, using mechanical means to adjust the setting of the engine to ensure alignment of the engine shaft with the propeller shaft. when aligning machinery by the traditional method any small alignment errors made either at the stern tube or at the engine will be very troublesome as the work of lining up the intermediate shafting proceeds, and it may be necessary to move the engine from its designed position. furthermore, since alignment of the machinery depends on all the components being in position, delay in the delivery of any one component can delay the finishing of the vessel and possibly its eventual delivery. ancillary work such as the building of ladderways and walkways cannot be completed, and the fitting of oil and fuel lines and cooling water pipes cannot even be commenced, until all the main propelling components of the ship's machinery are in place, so that even when alignment of the machinery has been achieved, completion of the installation work will then take several more weeks. an object of the present invention is to provide a method of construction in which alignment and positioning of. components of a structure, such as the machinery of a ship under construction, can be effected accurately without all the components having to be in place, and with minimal on-site adjustments. according to the present invention there is provided in one aspect a method of setting the position of a component in a structure such as a ship or building under construction, in which at least one measurement is made on the component before it is fitted in position to establish distances between at least two reference surfaces of the component, and at least one measurement is made on the structure itself, before positioning of the component, to determine the position in the structure at which one of the reference surfaces of the component is to be located, and the measurements on the component and the structure are combined to determine the size of at least one spacer or adjusting element which is positioned in the structure before the fitting of the component to predetermine the eventual position of the component in

 claims   1. a method of setting the forward-and-aft position of a component such as an engine bedplate (5) in a marine structure such as a ship (3) under construction, characterised in that at least one length measurement is made in the forward-and-aft direction on the component before the latter is fitted in position to establish the distance longitudinally between at least two reference end surfaces of the component, and at least one measurement(h) is made on the structure itself, before positioning of the component, to determine the position in the structure at which one of the reference surfaces of the component is to be located, and the measurements on the component and the structure are combined to determine the size of forward and aft end stoppers (22) which are positioned in the structure,  with the distance between the stoppers substantially equal to the said measured length of the component, to predetermine the forward-and-aft position of the component in the structure before said component is fitted.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1, in which optical sights (10, 11) are located at selected positions in the structure at which measurements are to be made and are aligned with each other using an optical instrument (7) mounted upon a table (30) and  capable of vertical and horizontal displacement and   of    tilt adjustment, the table being rotatable for sweeping of the instrument in a plane.   3. a method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which the width of the component for installation in a ship under construction is measured before its installation and at least two pairs of port and starboard adjustable stoppers (24) are then fixed to the structure (4), in different transverse planes along the sighting line, the distance between the said stoppers being adjusted to be equal to or slightly less than the said width, before the component is fitted.   4. a method of determining the mounting height of propulsion machinery (2) for installation on the tank top (4) of a ship under constructidn in which a sighting line (abcdef) corresponding to the axis of a propeller shaft or an engine crankshaft if determined by an optical sighting method and an optical sweep is then made in a plane substantially parallel to the sighting line to measure the distances from the sighting line of a number.  of machinery support positions on the tank top, measurements are made on a support bedplate (5) of the machinery before its installation to establish the height relative to the sighting line of the machinery bedplate at each support position, and bearing height adjustment  elements (15) are selected, each having a height determined from said measurements on the support bedplate and from the optical sweep measurements, the said adjustment elements being   located-at    the appropriate support positions to predetermine a correctly aligned position of the machinery upon the subsequent installation of the machinery bedplate on the tank top.   5. a method as claimed in claim 4, in which the measurements made on the machinery support bedplate before its installation include measurements at forward and aft reference positions   (,    e), these measurements being subtracted from the height of the sighting line at the positions measured in the optical sweep to obtain forward and aft reference heights of the bedplate above the tank top (4).   6. a method as claimed in claim 5, in which optical sights (8, 7) are established at the forward and aft reference positions, the aft sight being concentric with the shaft axis, sighting elements (11, 10) being carried by the forward and aft sights and supported at positions corresponding to the forward and aft reference heights of the base above the tank top, an optical sweep of the machinery support positions being made with the said sighting elements to obtain height measurements for each bearing height adjustment element (15).      7. a method as claimed in claim 4, claim 5 or claim 6, in which reference studs or screws are affixed to the lower surface of the support base, projecting a distance towards the upper surface of the tank top (4) such as to be spaced by a common reference distance therefrom upon the initial installation of the support base, measurement of said distance enabling subsequent deflections of the tank top to be monitored.
