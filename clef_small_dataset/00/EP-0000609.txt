<ABSTRACT>
19-nor-pregnahexaenes of formula    wherein a is hydrogen, lower alkyl, fluoro or fluoro-substituted  methyl;  r₁ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, or an acyl radical of a carboxylic  acid;  w is (h, h); (h, lower alkyl); (h, α-or₂), with r₂ being hydrogen  or an acyl radical of a carboxylic acid; or = cht, with t  being hydrogen, lower alkyl, fluorine, or chlorin; q is or₄,  with r₄ being hydrogen or an acyl radical of a carboxylic  acid; hydrogen, provided w is (h, h) or (h, lower alkyl); or  together with w represents a 16α, 17α-lower alkylidenedioxy  grouping;   y is (h, h), (h, oh), or oxygen;   z is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine;   r₃ is hydrogen or an acyl radical of a carboxylic acid; or or₃  together with q represents an alkylidenedioxy or alkylorthoalkanoate  grouping;   and when q is hydroxy and r₃ is hydrogen, the 17α, 20; 20,  21-bismethylenedioxy derivatives thereof; these compounds are novel, with the exception of the  21-acetate and 3,21-diacetate of 19-nor-pregna- 1,3,5 (10),  6,8,14- hexanene-3,17α, 21- triol-20-one, while pharmaceutical  compositions containing the latter two compounds are  also novel.  the preparation of the novel compounds by three  methods is described, in particular dehydrogenation in position  14 of appropriate 19-nor-pregna- 1,3,5(10), 6,8-pentaenes  by ddq.  representative compounds of the inventions  have been shown to exhibit antimitotic activity and, in  particular, are useful in treating psoriasis.
