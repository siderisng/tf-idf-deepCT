<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic liquid shaft seal for forming a seal between a  shaft (17) and a housing (15) through which the shaft extends  comprises a permanent magnetic ring (13) which has its axis  of magnetisation parallel to that of the shaft (17) and a ring of  magnetic liquid (14).  the ring (13) has its outer periphery  fixed and sealed in the housing (15) and the ring of liquid (14)  is held magnetically around the inner periphery of the ring  (13) and in movable contact with the shaft (17).  alternatively  the ring (13) may be fixed to the shaft (17) with the ring of  liquid interposed between the ring (13) and the housing (15).   a number of such sealing devices may be arranged in series  along the shaft.
