<ABSTRACT>
method and compositions are provided for producing  proteins expressed by a dna sequence free of proteins  expressed by other dna sequences where the dna sequ­ ences comprise a functional recombinant dna structure.  the  functional recombinant dna structure is formed by anneal­ ing and/or ligating a first dna sequence from a first source  which encodes for a polypeptide; a second dna sequence  comprising a vector compatible with a unicellular organism  which does not exchange genetic information with said first  source, said vector having an intact replicon and a promoter  for said first dna sequence; and a third dna sequence  synthetically introduced between said first and second  sequences either prior to or concomitantly with annealing  and/or ligating of said first and second dna sequences  encoding for a ribosomal binding site of said host, said third  dna sequence positioned adjacent a deoxyribonucleotide  triplet encoding for methionine.  the recombinant dna struc­ ture is then employed in the transformation of a unicellular  host to provide the host the capability of producing the  polypeptide free of other polypeptides.

<DESCRIPTION>
protein production at synthetic start site background of the invention field of the invention recombinant dna structures constructed by binding together segments of dna derived from different biological sources have opened an area for production of a wide variety of only difficulty accessible proteins and providing for bacterial capability of a wide variety of functions, which are not native to the particular bacterium. for example, various eukaryotic enzymes and hormones may be produced by employing a eukaryotic gene specific for such hormone or enzyme, such as somatostatin and insulin. alternatively, bacteria can be provided with the capability for the production of eukaryotic enzymes for performing chemical functions on a commercial scale. one of the difficulties encountered in producing proteins foreign to the bacterial host is that in the utilization of signals recognized by the host species to accomplish synthesis of the protein, the protein product may be a covalently linked hybrid protein comprising the protein of the plasmic vector and the protein of the exogeneous gene. unless there is some simple chemical or enzymatic technique for separating the two proteins, the product is not likely to be physiologically useful or economically efficient. also, where the naturally occr- ring protein is a prodrug, means may be required for cleaving the inert portion from the active drug portion. it is therefore desirable to find techniques which would allow for production of proteins, where the protein is produced in substantially native form and free of covalent bonding to other proteins. description of the prior art chang, et al, nature, in press (1978) describes phenotypic expression in e. coli. of a dna sequence coding for mouse dihydrofolate reductase. shine and dalgarno, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, 71, 1342 (1974) describe 3'-terminal sequence of e. coli. 16s ribosomal rna: complementarity to nonsense triplets and ribosome binding sites. steitz and steege, j. mol. biol. 114, 545 (1977) and steege, proc. nat. acad. sci. usa 74 4163 (1977) identify sequences on mrna in the 5' direction from the initiator codon that are complementary to the ccucc sequence at the 3' end of the 16s ribosomal rna species proposed to be involved in the binding of mrna to ribosomes. komaroff, et al, proc. natl. acad. sci., ¯¯¯¯¯¯ (1978) describes a bacterial clone synthesizing proinsulin where the recombinant plasmid has a polycytosine tail adjacent an internal codon reciprocal to methionine. copending u.s. application serial no. 687,430, filed may 17, 1976 describes the preparation of recombinant plasmids. summary of the invention method and compositions are provided for the production of a foreign protein by a bacterial host. the method employs a vector comprising a replicon having an intact replicator locus and capable of replication in said host, preferably in conjunction with a gene which allows for survival selection, an intact promoter and a dna sequence that ordinarily is not able to be propagated in said host. the foreign dna sequence has proximate to the 3'-terminus of the coding strand a codon which when transcribed defines the initiating methionine codon of
