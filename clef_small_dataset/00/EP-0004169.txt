<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an electrochemical cell with an  electrode having deposited thereon an electrocatalyst which  is a mixed oxide of nickel-molybdenum, nickel-tungsten,  cobalt-molybdenum or cobalt-tungsten and containing an  aqueous alkaline electrolyte comprising an aqueous solution  of a molybdenum, vanadium or tungsten compound.  the electrodes are preferably prepared by alternately  coating an electrode core with a compound of nickel or  cobalt, and with a compound of molybdenum or tungsten,  said compounds being capable of thermal decomposition to  the corresponding oxides, heating the coated core at an elevated  temperature to form a layer of the mixed oxides on the  core and finally curing the core with the mixed oxide layer  thereon in a reducing atmosphere at a temperature between  350°c and 600°c.  the cells are particularly suitable for use in  the electrolysis of water or brine.
