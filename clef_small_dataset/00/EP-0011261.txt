<ABSTRACT>
a charge transfer device is described which includes a  plurality of charge transfer channels or shift registers (1→n;  n +  →2n), each having at least two sections operable at two  different clock frequencies (f1,f2) to provide variable non-­ symmetrical time delays in the channels and which may be  operated with another identical charge transfer device to pro­ vide the functional equivalence of a single charge transfer  device having twice as many channels and providing sym­ metrical time delays in the channels.
