<ABSTRACT>
image pixels are sampled (24) and held to produce a box  car wave (28) representative of the image data.  wave height  differences are bridged by linear interpolation, (30, 31) and  frequency enhancement (36) imposed at the bridge junctures.   the modified image wave is thresholded (37) and sampled at a  multiple of the original frequency to provide image pixels (49)  comprised of both original image pixels (10) and one or more  interpolated image pixels (12) therebetween.  intermediate  image lines (l₁₋₁) are interpolated by comparing the image  pixels, some of which may be interpolated, on a pixel by pixel or  multiple pixel basis, one line pair (l₁, l₂) at a time.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of processing image data this invention relates to a method of processing image data in pixels including scanning an original image to provide a succession of lines of pixels representative of the original image. where image data in the form of analog or binary signals is to be handled, the generation of the image data, storage of the data, and transmission of the image data to one or more output stations where the data may be used to produce copies of the original represented by the data, presents conflicting problems in terms of the cost and complexity of the apparatus required versus the quality and resolution of the copies produced. where one attempts to optimize the quality and resolution of the copies produced, the price paid is usually reflected tn increased cost and complexity of the image data producing and handling apparatus, ie, in the data generating apparatus required to provide image samples or pixels in greater density, in a larger memory to store the image data pending use, and in increased data bandwidth on transmission of the data from one point to another. on the other hand, where one attempts to reduce and alleviate cost and simplify the data generating and handling apparatus by making fewer samples of the original, the savings is usually at the expense of decreased image resolution and quality. the present invention is intended to overcome these conflicting problems in the processing of image data in pixels, and is characterised by interpolating in each line extra image pixels from the original image pixels; and interpolating at least one additional line of output image pixels for each line scanned from the original image. the invention offers the advantage that resolution of the output image is enhanced, while image storage and transmission bandwidth requirements are reduced. one way of carrying out the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which: figure 1 is a schematic view showing interpolation of additional image pixels in a serial pixel stream of image data; figure 2 is a schematic view showing interpolation of additional image pixels both within a line pair of pixels and of an additional line of pixels between the line pair; figure 3 is a schematic outline of the image pixel interpolating system of the present invention; figure 4 is a schematic view showing details of the linear interpolator and enhancement filter of figure 3; figure 5 is a schematic view showing details of the image line interpolation system of the present invention; figure 6 is a timing chart of the clock pulses for the system of figure 5; ; figure 7 is a schematic illustrating a representative number of the image pixel patterns stored in memory and the addresses therefor; and figure 8 is an isometric view of an exemplary raster input scanning mechanism. referring to figures 1 and 2, there is provided a schematic illustration showing interpolation of additional image pixels 12 between real or original pixels

claims:   1. a method of processing image data in pixels, including scanning an original image (6) to provide a succession of lines of pixels (10) representative of the original image; characterised by interpolating in each line extra image pixels (12) from the original image pixels; and interpolating at least one additional line   (l1-1)    of output image pixels for each line scanned from the original image.   2. the image data processing method according to claim 1 characterised by the additional step of interpolating said one additional line of output image pixels from both said original image pixels and said interpolated extra image pixels.   3. the image data processing method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised by the steps of transmitting the original image pixels together with said interpolated extra image pixels to a remote output station, and performing the step of interpolating said one additional line of output image pixels at said remote output station.    the image data processing method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterised by the additional step of interpolating said one additional line of output image pixels using the original image pixels from two adjoining lines.      5. the image data processing method of any of claims 1 to 4 characterized by the additional steps of: sampling (24) the voltage level of said original image pixels in succession; forming a box car signal wave !28) from said sampled voltage levels by holding each voltage level for a preset interval; interpolating linearly (30, 31) between different ones of said voltage levels along said signal wave over said preset interval; frequency enhancing (36) said signal wave; thresholding (37) said signal wave to convert the signal wave to a binary signal wave (43); and sampling said binary signal wave (46, 49) at a frequency greater than the input frequency of said original image pixels to provide output image pixels with a greater number of pixels than the original image pixels.     6. the image data processing method according to claim 5 characterized by the additional step of sampling said binary signal wave at a frequency twice that of said input frequency.
