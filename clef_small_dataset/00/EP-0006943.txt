<ABSTRACT>
in an automatic transmission for a vehicle in which an  input shaft (2) is connected to a driving shaft (1) of an engine  through a torque converter (t) provided with a pump wheel  (5p) connecting to the driving shaft (1) and a turbine wheel (5t)  connecting to the input shaft (2), a torque convertor controlling  system which is provided with a hydraulically operated  clutch (d) inserted between the pump wheel (5p) and the  turbine wheel (5t) for directly connecting these wheels, and a  centrifugal valve (f) between a hydraulic cylinder (14) of the  directly connecting clutch (d) and a high pressure fluid channel  (28) connecting to the fluid source (p) and a low pressure  fluid channel (29) connecting to a fluid reservoir (r) so that the  hydraulic cylinder (14) is connected to the low pressure fluid  channel (29) during a lower speed rotation period whereas the  hydraulic cylinder (14) is connected to the high pressure fluid  channel (28) by the centrifugal valve (f) in cooperation with  the turbine wheel (5t).
