<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for the production of snow by spraying water droplets, comprising the step of controlling at least the water flow to be sprayed and frozen at the measured ambient complete cold, characterized in that it comprises the steps of measuring the velocity and the moving direction of the ambient air on purpose to determine a measured value of the renewed ambient air volume, of detecting the water flow value and of automatically regulating by means of a regulation and control device, the water flow by control means which cause each value of the measured ambient complete cold, according to the laws of correspondence, and each value of the hourly volume of the measured new ambient air to correspond to a value of said water flow, and also of regulating the water flow as a function of the gap between the proper value of the measured water flow determined from said laws of correspondence, on purpose to cause the water flow to correspond to the ambient complete cold and the hourly volume of the renewed ambient air, as to cancel said gap.
