<ABSTRACT>
a microprocessor based electronic game device has a  central unit with a digital display (28, 29) and several remote  units (2) for the players.  any of several games to play can be  selected by controls (7-10) on the central unit.  further controls  (11-26) serve for inputting other instructions and/or informa­ tion to the unit.  information relating to or forming part of a  game can be displayed on the digital display (28, 29) other  information such as scores or score totals can also be dis­ played.  the device is self-contained, not requiring connection  to an external television set.  in one game the digital display is  arranged to generate letter symbols.  the digital display can  be provided by 7-segment display cells and may be arranged,  in one game, to generate certain letter symbols and in another  game to generate dice representations.

<DESCRIPTION>
electronic game device the invention relates to electronic game devices enabling the playing of one or more games for several players. there are already known electronic game devices, in particular game devices making use of programmed microprocessors, which offer the possibility of various games for several players, when used in combination with a television receiving set. such necessity to use external "video-" means does however constitute a considerable drawback for said known devices, both with respect to the overall investment involved, and to their ease and independence of operation. this invention seeks to provide electronic game devices which are independent of external "video-" means and can be operated without further equipment, and can thereby provide a considerable scope of entertaining possibilities. to this end the invention provides new electronic game devices with programmed microprocessor(s), which comprise one central unit, provided with manually operable means for governing operation of the device, and with digital display means, for displaying information in connection with said performance; and a plurality of remote units provided with control means for effecting human intervention in operation of the game device by which players can participate in the game being played. in one aspect the new electronic game devices in accordance with the invention are based on at least one programmed microprocessor and are characterized by comprising a central unit provided with manually operable means for the input of instructions and/or information to the central unit, to thereby effect selection of one of several games possible with the device and/or selection among possible playing conditions for a game, the unit also being provided with digital display means for displaying information in connection with the game being played; and a plurality of remote units, connected or connectable to said central unit, each provided with at least one manually operable control by operation of which a player can participate in the game being played; the game device being arranged to display a plurality of categories of information on the said or other digital display means, including information relating to scoring points associated with steps in play of the game and/or accumulated scoring point totals associated with each remote unit. the manually operable means for the input of instructions and/or information to the central unit may enable selection of a game and the preselection of playing conditions for the selected game, and also cause progress of a game from one step in play of the game to the next. the device may be arranged to display on the digital display means of the central unit, at different times, information in each of the following categories - information relating to playing conditions preselected through the central unit for the particular game selected; - playing instructions for, and/or information about, progress of the game, and/or information forming at least part of a turn of play in the game; and - the said information relating to scoring. the said information forming at least part of a turn of play may be a randomly generated
