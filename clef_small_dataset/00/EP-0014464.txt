<ABSTRACT>
hole seeking apparatus for material webs is disclosed  which features a light source (11) for projecting a light beam  onto a mirror wheel arrangement (15) located optically in  front of a concave mirror (17) so as to produce a scanning  beam in the image space of the concave mirror.  the scanning  beam is continuously displaced parallel to itself so as to  periodically scan along a scanning path on the material web  (18).  the mirror wheel arrangement (15) consists of two  substantially identical mirror wheels (15a, 15b) which lie  coaxially on one another and which are displaced by a half  pitch.  the dimensions of the light bead (16) at its point of  incidence on the mirror wheels (15a, 15b) and the optical  geometry of the apparatus are selected to avoid light being  scattered at an edge of either of the mirror wheels and passing  to either side of the web.  scattered light is thus prevented  from falling on a light receiving device (17) arranged behind  the web and intended to detect the presence of holes therein.   in this way the false recognition of a hole at the margins of  web is prevented.  the invention also relates to a pair of mirror wheels for  use in the hole seeking apparatus described above and in  other beam scanning optical apparatus.
