<ABSTRACT>
a disc brake assembly, for a two-wheeled vehicle, having  a caliper assembly (10) supported from the axle (2) of the  braked wheel at two places relatively widely distanced apart,  whereby the caliper assembly is supported stably.  to enhance  this stable support, in particular forms, continuous support is  provided between the two places just mentioned; and there is  a common plane (x-x) radial of the wheel axle (2) that passes  through a bearing (9) for the wheel, a zone that contains one of  the two places, and the brake disc (7).  the caliper assembly  (10) can be connected to the vehicle frame by a torque link (20)  with resilient bushes (21) interposed between the link and the  caliper assembly and the frame.  the caliper assembly can in­ clude a chamber (31) for lubricating medium.  and can com­ prise an outer caliper member (13) that forms a cover for an in­ oer caliper member (15), the brake disc (7) and brake pads (16,  16).
