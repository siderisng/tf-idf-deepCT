a process for producing nicotine which comprises cultivating  a strain of nicotiana tabacum or nicotiana rustica in  suspension culture under sub-maximal growth conditions  which do not inhibit nicotine production, in the presence of an  auxin and a cytokinin.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
preparing nicotine by culturing a. nicotiana strain this invention relates to a process for preparing nicotine by in vitro cultivation of a variety of nicotiana tabacuni or nicotiana rustica in a nutrient culture medium. work shich has hitherto been published on the cultivation of nicotiana tabacum varieties implies that some , but by no means all, of the tested varieties contain low levels of nicotine. b1uch of the work has been done n conjunction with observations on growth using batches of callus culture. cultivation in suspension cultures is described in nature, vol. 201 (1964), pp. 614 and in fiochem. physiol. pflanzen, " 62, 513 (19/1), pp. 503-513. in the former reference, it is stated that "the highest nicotine levels were found at the end of the growth". a conclusionÂ¯ of the latter reference is that callus cultures start to produce alkaloid (including nicotine) after the addition of cycloheximide (which inhibits growth), whereas, in suspension cultures, alkaloi production is dependent on the conditions of growth. it appears that alkaloid production was stimulated during sub-maximal growth, alkaloids accumulating during tne initial phase of growth, e.g. within a period of five days. it was observed after the initial phase that the level of nicotine ren:ainedsubstan- tially constant. another method of regulating growth discussed in the second reference, in order to achieve greater nicotine production, is by using the tedium proposed in ann. sci. nat. biol. veg. 14,1 (1953) by r. heller. it appears generally to be the case that nicotine production is at a maximum under conditions of sub-maximal growth but hitherto theiehas been no disclosure of how cultivation of nicotiana varieties might be made a commercial proposition. the effect of hormone levels has been observed by shiio et al, agr. biol. chem. 37 (8), pp. 1857-1864, and ohta et al, agr. biol. chef. 42 (6), 978), pp. 1245-1251, using callus cultures. -the reported results, particularly of the former reference, are extremely difficult to interpret but, in general, there is no certainty that results achieved with callus cultures can be reproduced with suspension cultures. callus cultures consist of large cell agglomerates, and nicotine may be produced even when the conditions are suitable for maximal growth, because cells within agglomerates'are not growing. indeed, one of the foremost workers in this field, tabata, reported in 'frontiers of plant tissue culture" (1978)ed. thorpe, proc. 4th int. cong, plant tissue and cell culture, that nicotine production may be up to 4o%4less in suspension culture than in callus culture. in suspension culture, it is likely that an optimal growth medium will stimulate cell growth and inhibit nicotine production in a substantially uniform manner. shiio et al and ohtz et al both used auxins in their cultivation media, and these hormones, at high concentration levels, tend to reduce cell agglomeration in liquid cultures but also to inhibit nicotine production. in particular, when shiio et al grew nicotiana tabacum yar. bright yellow on a medium containingl-naphthaleneacetic acid, they found that kinetin inhibited both growth and nicotine production. according to the
