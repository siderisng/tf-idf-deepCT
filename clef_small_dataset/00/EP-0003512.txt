<ABSTRACT>
a telephone lock for attachment to a telephone permits  a user to dial local calls only with a first predetermined  number of digits.  upon lifting a receiver/speaker (26)  from a cradle (54) connected to the telephone lock, a  counting device (74, 88, 140, 142) counts the first number  of digits.  a ratchet wheel (88) rotatably mounted on the  lock is advanced from an initial position by a first preset  angle against the action of a spring (104) by a ratchet  wheel advancement device (74, 140, 142) following dialing  of one of the predetermined number of digits.  a first dialing  stop device (88, 96) restrains the user from dialing the first  digit on a dialing device for reaching the operator on an  initial dialing, and a second dialing device (82, 102) restrains  the user from dialing an additional number of digits,  when the ratchet wheel (88) has advanced from the initial  position by a second preset angle.  when the receiver/  speaker (26) has been replaced on the cradle (54), the  dialing device is reset to a starting position.
