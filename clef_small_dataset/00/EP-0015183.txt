<ABSTRACT>
This electric toothbrush is of the type in which the brush itself (4) is rotatably driven around its longitudinal axis (17);it is prolonged forward by a tip (9) capable of being introduced into the interdental space to massage the papilla and clean the mesy and distal faces of the teeth;The brush itself is wrapped in about one-third of its periphery by a coaxial gutter (8) and this coaxial gutter terrium with a fork-shaped end-shaped end which serves as a free guide at the end of the longitudinal axis (17) of the brush proper;The rotational movement of this axis (17) gives it a simultaneous back and forth movement that is transmitted at its point (9).
