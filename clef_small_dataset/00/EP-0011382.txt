<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides an apparatus and method for  monitoring the electrical conductivity of a web surface in  which a forwardly moving web is exposed to en electrical field  generated by a forwardly extending high voltage source so  disposed adjacent the web as to induce a transverse redis­ tribution of the electrical charges present on the web surface,  the electrical field signal generated by the redistributed sur­ face charges of opposite polarity to that of the source being  monitored by a suitable field detector.  surface conductivity of  a web may therefore be continuously and reliably monitored  by a non-contacting technique, and the system is particularly  suitable for controlling the level of antistatic behaviour  induced in polymeric packaging films.
