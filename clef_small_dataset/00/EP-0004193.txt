<ABSTRACT>
a method for quickly cutting rigid polyurethane foam  laminate, especially metal faced laminate, while the laminate  is continuously transported on a conveyor, consists of moving  circular saws, arranged in fixed disposition alternately  above and below the laminate, towards and away from the  laminate in a line perpendicular to the laminate.  the saw  blades collectively extend across the width of the laminate.   alternatively the blades are moved with a gyratory motion to  increase the effective cutting width of each blade enabling  the blade diameter to be reduced.  saws 11 and 12 are two of three saws extending across  the width of laminate 14 supported on a frame 15 mounted in  guides 16 on a carriage 17 movable in synchronism with  advancing laminate 14.  the saw blades 11′ and 12′ are  moved alternately into cutting engagement with the laminate  by displacement of frame 15 relatively to carriage 17.
