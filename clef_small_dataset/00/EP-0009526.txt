<ABSTRACT>
a resin is provided which is the adduct of a monocarbox­ ylic acid and a diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol or of a monocar­ boxylic acid, a bisphenol and a diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol,  reacted with an anhydride to an acid no.  of 35 to 150.  this  resin is solubilized with a volatile amine, ammonia or nh₄oh  in a solvent mixture of water, alkoxyethanols, alcohols and  alkyl ethers of diethylene glycol and combined with an  aminoplast to produce a coating composition utilizable to  coat surfaces that will contact a food or beverage, such as in  metal packaging containers.

<DESCRIPTION>
water-solubilizable epoxy resin and coating composition comprising the resin for metal food contact surfaces this invention relates to epoxy based resins water-solubilizable with ammonia or an amine and with water based coating compositions containing them. it has been proposed to form water dilutable emulsions or dispersions containing epoxy resins for use as water based coatings. such coatings have disadvantages and it is highly desirable to provide water-soluble epoxy based coatings. prior epoxy based coatings have poor shelf life due to the presence of oxirane groups and/or unreacted anhydride. in copending application serial no. 736,984, filed october 29, 1976, now u.s. patent no. 4,105,614, there is disclosed a resin in which the epoxy groups of a diglycidyl ether are capped with a bisphenol and the resultant material is reacted with an anhydride to provide water-solubilizable carboxyl groups. the resins of this invention utilizing a monocarboxylic acid, such as stearic acid, have advantages over the resins of u.s. patent no. 4,105,614. 1. coatings made therefrom do not absorb n-heptyl p-hydroxybenzoate, a preservative used to stabilize unpasteurized beer. 2. coatings made therefrom have less effect on the flavor of beer on short term storage. 3. the coating formulations have higher solids content at application viscosity, which permits use of a single coating to attain coating weights necessary in standard applications. application viscosity is generally 154-100 sec., preferably 25-70 sec., &num;2 zahn cup. the final coating formulation has better shelf life, as measured by viscosity change. insofar as is now known a resin system of this type and coatings containing them have not been proposed. this invention provides a water solubilzable resin that comprises an adduct of a monocarboxylic acid and a diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol or of a monocarboxylic acid, a bisphenol and a diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol, using an equivalent ratio of total monocarboxylic acid and bisphenol, if used, to diglycidyl ether between about 1:1 and about 1.2:1, further adducted with an anhydride in an amount sufficient to provide an acid number between about 35 and about 150. it also provides a coating composition comprising such resin and an aminoplast, in a weight ratio between about 95:5 and about 70:30 solubilized with a volatile tertiary amine, ammonia or ammonium hydroxide to a ph of about 7.0 to about 9.1 in at least one solvent of the group alcohols, alkoxyethanols, ketones and alkyl ethers of diethylene glycol, each present in between about one weight percent and about 20 weight percent of the weight of the final composition and diluted with water to a solids content between about 10 weight percent and about 25 weight percent. it also provides substrates coated with such coating composition and metal packaging containers, interior coated with such coating composition and baked, containing a food or beverage. the water dilutable resins of this invention are prepared by adducting sufficient monocarboxylic acid or monocarboxylic acid and bisphenol to a diglycidyl ether of a bisphenol to react with all epoxy groups. the diglycidyl ether is usually heated to about
