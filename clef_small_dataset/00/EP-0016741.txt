<ABSTRACT>
the web of material is brought to pass through a suction  chamber (2) having inlet (12) and outlet (13) for the web of  material and one or more air outlets (11), for instance at the  bottom thereof, which outlets are connected to a suction  source.  a means (4) for working the web of material (1) may  be provided inside the suction chamber.  the inlet (12) and  the outlet (13) have substantially the same cross-section  area, and the outlet (13) is formed with straight, smooth  walls, whereas the inlet is restricted by a limit bar (16, 17) on  both sides of the suction chamber wall (18), which limit bars  (16, 17) define the cross-section area of the inlet (12) and  which have an overhang over the opening (15) of the suction  chamber wall (18) of 5-10 mm, and which preferably are  provided at a distance from each other of at least about 30  mm.
