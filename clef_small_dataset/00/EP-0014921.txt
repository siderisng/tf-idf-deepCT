<ABSTRACT>
coating compositions containing polyurethane latex par­ ticles having hydrophobic compounds associated therewith  and processes for preparing such compositions are disclosed.   these "loaded" polyurethane latices are comparatively more  stable than are loaded vinyl polymer latices.  polyurethane  latices made of polycaprolactone prepolymers form particu­ larly stable loaded latices.

<DESCRIPTION>
coating compositions and processes the present invention relates to coating compositions and to processes for preparing such com- positions. the coating compositions are particularly useful in preparing coated layers on photographic elements. hydrophobes can become associated with latex polymer particles in an aqueous dispersion. these latices, wherein the idividual latex polymer particles have associated therewith a hydrophobe, are referred herein to as "loaded latices". these loaded latices are useful in providing aqueous coating compositions of hydrophobic materials which might otherwise have to be coated or applied from an organic solvent-containing composition. for example, in the photographic arts many of the image-forming layers are hydrophilic, yet many of the useful photographic chemicals are hydrophobic. thus, while the coating processes as a whole are adapted to applying aqueous coatings, photographic addenda such as color-couplers, developing agents, uv absorbers and the like must be either dissolved in an organic solvent and dispersed as oil droplets in photographic emulsions or coated from organic solvents. by virtue of the latex loading technique, these hydrophobic photographic components can now be associated with polymeric latex particles and can therefore be coated from aqueous coating compositions. a latex loading process is described in research disclosure, vol. 159, item 15930, july, 1977. in one preferred embodiment of this described process, the hydrophobe to be loaded is dissolved in a water-miscible organic solvent. this organic solution of the hydrophobe is then blended with an aquetur dispersion of the polymerie latex particles. while come inading of the hydrophobe takes place upon biending, lcading is greatly enhanced by removing the ergenie solvent from the mixture. in this manner, the nydrophche becomes "loaded" onto or into the pilymer particles of the latex, i.e., associated with ydrsphobes are described in the aboveidentified besearch dischlosure as compounds which are essentially incoluble in distilled water of 25 c. ne dissolved concentration of hydrophobe in a saturated aqueaus solution under these conditions is less than abour 0,5% by weight, based on the weight of the solution. while this definition defines hydrophobes which are injeed quite hydrophoble, many compounds are extremele insoluble, which results in saturated water solutions which are considerably less than 0,5% by weight of the compound. the above-identified research disclosure deseriber a wide variety of latices which can be loaded at(crclng to the described procedure. any latex which eats ne "loadable polymer particle test" as describhat research disclosure is useful. polymer particles which are particularly useful are polymer particles made from ethylenically unsaturated monomers. one specific polymer which is listed as being useful is a poly(n-buty) acrylate-co-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid). extremely insoluble hydrophobes are successfully loaded into this and similar vinyl polymer particles. however, the resulting loaded latex dispersion is generally not storagestable. typically, the highly hydrophobic compound will crystalize and precipitate from the loaded latex after a short period of time. while this short period of tire for example, a few hours or less, is sufficiently lcng to allow for coating of the composition, it would be desirable to be able to prepare coating compositions containing
