<ABSTRACT>
a clamp for displaying merchandise or for use as an  incorporation into a garment hanger.  the clamp (10) has two  jaws joined by an integral hinge (24) and folded together to  form a "clothes-pin" type of clamp.  each jaw of the device  comprises an inner and an outer panel (21), (22) integrally  joined by a hinge (23), folded upon one another and detachÂ­ ably locked together.  a u-shaped spring (13) biases the clamp  into closed position.  the spring seates over the folded inner  panels its legs being located between these and the outer  panels so that it is totally concealed from both front and back  and largely concealed from the sides.
