<ABSTRACT>
a facsimile transmitter has a rotatable drum 10 and a  sensor 18 for detecting dark-light variations in a document  mounted on the drum 10.  prior to transmission of modulated  signals representing the dark-light variations in the document  on drum 10, synchronizing signals are transmitted  from the transmitter to a facsimile receiver comprising a  rotatable drum and a writing stylus for reproducing dark-light  variations on a copy medium mounted on the drum.   the synchronizing signals comprise pulses of selected and  controlled frequency duration and time lapse there-between  to signal to the receive the transmission model selected at  the transmitter.  the various modes which can be signalled  include different and variable scanning rates, different frequency  bandwidths and different forms of modulation.
