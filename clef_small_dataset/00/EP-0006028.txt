<ABSTRACT>
a time-temperature indicator (t-t indicator) is described  which is useful for monitoring the shelf lives of various  perishable articles.  the device is constructed of a vapor-permeable  barrier (4) positioned between a vapor and an  indicator (5), both housed in a vapor-impermeable container  (3).  the device is activated just prior to the monitoring period  by providing vapor to the container, as for example, by  rupturing a solvent-filled frangible reservoir (7).  the indicator,  upon contact with the vapor produces a visual color  response, and the vapor is constrained to permeate through  the vapor-permeable barrier before contacting the indicator,  thus creating a characteristic induction period before a color  response occurs.  the time required for the color response to  occur in the device is a function of the temperature and time.   the induction period can be varied by the thickness and type  of material of construction used for the vapor-permeable  barrier, the nature of the vapor and the nature of the  indicator employed.
