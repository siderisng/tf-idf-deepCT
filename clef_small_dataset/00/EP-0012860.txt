<ABSTRACT>
The body (10) has a number of rigidly connected parts (11, 12), which are individually connected to a same number of intermediate frames (17, 21) by means of parallel spring pairs (15, 16; 19, 20).The intermediate framing (17,21) are arranged alternately on opposite sides of the body (10) and in turn fastened by means of parallel spring pairs (37, 38; 47, 48; 49, 50; 51, 52) on a spring-mounted main frame (40).When the between frame (17, 21) with the body (10) swing in phase, it performs a spatially linear movement.If by means of electromagnetic means (100, 102, 103; 104, 106, 107) one of the intermediate frame (17,21) is driven out of phase, the body (10) swings along a lifniskate.
