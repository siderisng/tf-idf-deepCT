<ABSTRACT>
this invention involves a process for preparing a preÂ­ gelatinized modified starch particularly suitable for use in  instant puddings.  to an aqueous slurry containing an  ungelatinized starch there is added an effective amount of a  modifier which is sodium or calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate or a  combination of a protein and an emulsifier.  the slurry is  heated to a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to  gelatinize the starch, and the starch recovered.  the resultant  pregelatinized modified starch possesses a smoother,  creamier mouthfeel and has a high sheen.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for manufacturing starch products generally there are two principal ways in which starch can be processed. first, starch can be chemically modified in water or solvents and dried, resulting in whole, individual starch granules. this is the type of starch used in puddings which require cooking. secondly, if an instant water soluble starch is needed, the starch is pregelatinized by, for example, passing a starch slurry over a drum dryer. the drum dryer simultaneously cooks and dries the starch in cold water swellable sheets. this type of starch is used in instant puddings. a starch which is chemically modified is one in which physical properties such as viscosity, texture, dispersibility, stability and syneresis are altered. the important chemical means of making these kinds of changes are acid hydrolysis, oxidation, cross-linking, esterification and etherification. however, associated with some chemical modifications are undesirable byproducts or residues (e.g., chlorohydrin residues, etc.). another suggested means is the creation of an osmotic condition by the addition of various salts to a starch slurry prior to gelatinization in order to inhibit bursting of starch granules by controlling swelling of the granules. however, the resultant starch granules generally do not fully swell and lack uniformity in the degree of gelatinization thus producing a starch which is substantially inferior to the chemically modified starches. thus the present application is concerned primarily with the method of obtaining starch products, suitable for use in instant puddings utilizing a starch such as tapioca starch which is not chemically modified by the addition of any chemicals which react with the starch. in the present process the starch is physically modified by complexing and drum drying the tapioca starch with certain specific additives which act to mimic the characteristics of a chemically modified starch in an instant pudding formulation. among the desirable characteristics are firmness, creaminess, smoothness, gloss, and a melt away or mouth release effect. the desired objective is to obtain a good quality starch for use in instant pudding without the necessity of chemical modification of the starch molecule itself. additionally, since no undesirable chemicals will be utilized to react with a starch, the otherwise necessary step of washing a starch to remove reaction salts or residues formed during manufacturing is not necessary. thus, the environmental problem of disposing of chemical effluents is eliminated. it thus becomes a feature of this invention to provide a process for the modification of starch but without undesirable by-products or residues. it is a further feature of one embodiment of this invention to produce a physically modified pregelatinized starch having properties of a chemically modified pregelatinized starch. according to the invention therefore there is provided a process for making a pregelatinized starch product suitable for use in an instant pudding comprising mixing an aqueous slurry of ungelatinized starch with a modifier which is either a sodium or calcium stearoyl-zlactylate or a combination of a protein and an emulsifier, heating the slurry to a temperature and for a time sufficient to gelatinize the starch and
