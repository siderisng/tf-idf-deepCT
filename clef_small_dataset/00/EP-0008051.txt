<ABSTRACT>
an equipment cover for protectively insulated distribution inserts which can be assembled from dielectric profile parts, plug-in angle connectors and a cover plate is characterised according to the invention in that it consists essentially of at least one piece of an endless dielectric profile (10. . . 13 inter alia), cut to size perpendicular to its longitudinal axis according to the requirements, of mutually identical, or mirror image, end caps or corner caps (14. . . 17 inter alia) which remain visible even after installation and have integrally formed parts (28, 29, 31, 32 inter alia) which are matched to the profiling of the dielectric profile and can be plugged together with the profile, and the end or corner caps having attachment openings (19. . . 22 inter alia) for attachment of the equipment cover and the equipment cover also consisting of a cover plate (18 inter alia), likewise cut to size, having openings or easily separated sectors (23. . . 27) through which installation equipments or other installation elements can pass.  in this case, the cover plate can also be a component of the endless dielectric profile (37).  equipment covers of different sizes can be achieved in this manner with comparatively small outlays for tools and storage requirements in which smaller imprecisions in the process of separating the individual parts are not apparent.  <image>
