<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention nuclear s ub s ti tuted 2 -hydroxyphenylmethane- sulfamic acids. abstract of the disclosure nuclear substituted 2-hydroxyphenylmethanesulfamic acids and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts wherein the phenyl nucleus is substituted with 2 to 4 nuclear substituents and which are useful salureticdiuretics and anti-inflammatories are disclosed. the products may-be prepared by reacting nuclear substituted salicylaldehydes with ammonium sulfamate to generate intermediate imines which are reduced to afford the compounds of this invention. summary of the invention this invention relates to a new class of chemical compounds which can be described generally as nuclear substituted 2-hydroxyphenylmethanesulfamic acids and to their nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. pharmacological studies indicate that the instant products are effective diuretic and saluretic agents which can be used in the treatment of conditions associated with electrolyte and fluid retention and hypertension. when administered in a therapeutic dosage in conventional vehicles, the instant products effectively reduce the amount of sodium and chloride ions in the body, lower dangerous excesses of fluid to acceptable levels, and, in general, alleviate conditions usually associated with edema and hypertension. in addition, pharmacological studies indicate that the instant products of this invention are effective antiinflammatory agents which can be used in the treatment of inflammation when administered topically, orally, rectally or parenterally. when applied topically, the instant products are particularly effective in the treatment of dermatological disorders and like conditions, such as dermititis (actimic, atopic, contact, eczematoid, seborrheic and stasis), herpetiformis, lichen planus, neurodermatitus, intitrigo, lichen simplex chronicus, and puritus, as well as for topical treatment of inflammation of the respiratory and intestinal mucosa, such as allergic rhinitus, bronchitis, bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, colitis and the like. the nuclear substituted 2-hydroxyphenylmethanesulfamic acids of this invention are compounds having the following structural formula: emi2.1 (i) wherein x1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or lower alkoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms; x2 is halogen or straight or branched chain lower alkyl wherein the alkyl group has up to 5 carbon atoms; x3 is hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl having up to 5 carbon atoms or lower alkoxy having up to 5 carbon atoms; x4 is halogen, trifluoromethyl or loweralkylthio wherein the alkyl group has 1 to 3 carbon atoms; and the non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. a more preferred aspect of this invention is constituted by those compounds of formula i wherein: x1 is hydrogen or lower alkoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms; x is halogen or branched chain lower alkyl wherein the alkyl group has 3 to 5 carbon atoms; x3 is hydrogen or lower alkoxy of 1 to 3 carbon atoms; 4 x is halogen, trifluoromethyl or alkylthio wherein the alkyl group has 1 to 3 carbon atoms; and the non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. a most preferred embodiment of this invention consists of those compounds of formula i wherein: x1 and x3 are hydrogen or methoxy; x2 is chloro, bromo, iodo or branched chain lower alkyl wherein the alkyl group has 3 to 5 carbon atoms;
