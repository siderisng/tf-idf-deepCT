<ABSTRACT>
1.  inert-gas torch (10) for arc welding with a consumable electrode with two concentric, welding current carrying tubes (15, 10), the most central one (15) of which serves for gas supply and electrode feeding and forms a forced circuit for the cooling water with the external tube (16) lying around it, both tubes (15, 16) ending in a receiving part (18) for a current contact nozzle (19), and with a tubular shell (21) which is electrically insulated against both tubes and has a gas nozzle support (22) with an inert-gas nozzle (23) attached to that end which is assigned to the current contact nozzle (19) whereby an electrical insulation (24) is located between the gas nozzle support (22) and the two current-carrying tubes (15, 16), being characterized by the fact that the insulation (24) has an insulating coating (25) out of well heat-conducting metal with a well heat-conducting, highly heat-resistant polyimid foil coating (26) and is coupled by pressing it to gas nozzle support (22) and external, current-carrying, water-cooled tube (16).
