<ABSTRACT>
an improvement in the embossing of a thermoplastic  textile, in particular the topsheet of an adsorbent structure  such as a diaper, which improves the high load caliper of the  textile.  the knobs and depressions of the mated embossing  rolls used to emboss the textile have side walls which define  a small angle with respect to a radius of the embossing roll.   the preferred embossing knobs (25) and depressions (27)  each define a frustum with a rhombic base and land, with the  longer diagonal of the rhombus aligned in the machine direc­ tion of the embossing roll.  the resulting embossed textile  has stronger bosses, and thus maintains a greater caliper  under load, than is observed in the prior art embossed tex­ tile.

improveu emeossed teztile, method and apparatus for its manufacture and articles made therewitn the field of the invention is the at of embossing and moe partioularl the art of embossing a thermoplastic textile in order to inoeasc its ability lo isolate two surfaces between which it is pleced undera moderate load the primary use for the embossed material is as a topshest for an absorbent structure, such as a diaper the most pertinent art of which the inventor is aware is u.s. patent no. 4,041,951, issued to sanford on august 10, 1977, and assigned to the owner of the present inventin. the snford p@tent discloses that textile material ma be embossed using mated stell embossing rolls in or@er to form a pattern of bosses which serves to isslate the skin of the wearer of an absorbent structure such as a diaper from the underlying absorbent material in order to improve the surface dryness of the absorbent structure. (as used herein, "textile" refers to a substantially planar shoet or web of a thermoplastic material, including nonwoven and woven fabrics and fibers, as well as analogous materihl. as a preforred ombodment of the invention, te sanferd patent diseloses the use of a male steel embossing roll and a ruhber-surfaced ii\ roll to e.:o.r t.u fl'?t -: , 'hrein tbc j:nobs @e male roll are elllpt@est in cross section haviny a land area cold approximately 0.084 inch (2.13 rair by 0.042 inches (1.07 mm.) and a knob height of approximately 0,070 iches (1.78 mm.), said knobs being arrarged in a diamond-shape array containing si knobs p: inch of roll width (0.236 knobs per ma.) and twelve i-ows of knobs per inch of roll circumference (0.472 knobs per mm.). the sanrord patent above cited is heeby incorporated herein by reference to more completeb; define the bac;- ground and objects of the present invention. summary of the inyention the present invention defines an improvement over the sanford disclosure by providing an embossed textile having a pattern of bosses which mote effectively resists debossment as a result of pressure aprlied to the embossed textile when it is incorporated in an absorbent structure. this is accomplished by embossing the textile with mated steel embossing rolls which have a knob and depression pattern with mating side walls which define a plane angle of less than about 28 degrees, and more preferably about 20 degrees, with respect to a plane which is perpendicular to a tangent plane of the embossing surface. this pattern results in a lower clearance between the adjacent side walls of a mating know and depression when the rolls are separated by a given roll clearance as measured along a radius common tothe mating rolls. this reduced side wall clearance is believed to enhance the degree of cold drawing of the textile during embossing as well as to provide sharper definition of the resulting boss than is observed in the prior art embossing technique. brief description of the drawings figure l is a schematic side elevational
