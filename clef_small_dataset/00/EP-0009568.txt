<ABSTRACT>
a liner construction for stack-like structures, such as  industrial and utility type chimneys and method for forming  such a construction are disclosed.  the liner includes a plural­ ity of rods or cables supported at their upper ends to an  upper portion of a chimney structure and extends down­ wardly within the chimney and over a substantial length of  the height of the chimney.  a plurality of hoops or the like are  secured to the rods to form a framework of open sections.   mesh is secured to the framework.  a body of non-metallic  settable material such as concrete encases the mesh and  framework.  tubular heat insulation may be secured to the  framework to abut the outer surface of the concrete body.   the method for forming the liner includes the initial step of  suspending a tubular framework of open sections from an  upper portion of a chimney to extend downwardly within the  confines of the chimney and over a substantial length of the  chimney height.  mesh is secured to the framework to define  a generally tubular shell.  a mortar of non-metallic settable  material such as concrete is applied to the mesh beginning  the bottom and continuing upwardly to the top of the shell to  complete the liner.
