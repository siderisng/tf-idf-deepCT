<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns an anchoring cartridge for use in  anchoring an anchor element in a hole in a substrate by  means of a self-setting composition comprising interactive  solid and liquid components.  the cartridge comprises a  container (1) housing the solid component (4) of the  composition, the container being formed of a material such  as metal or plastics, which does not absorb the liquid  component of the composition.  the container has a plurality  of holes (2), preferably each between 0. 1 mm² and 500 mm²  in area, whereby when the cartridge is immersed in the liquid  component, the liquid passes through the holes (2) into the  container (1) and reacts with the solid component (4) to form  the self-setting composition.  when the cartridge is immersed  in the liquid component, loss of self-setting composition  through the holes (2) is prevented by, for example, including  a thixotropic agent in the composition or by compaction of  the solid component (4).  the invention includes a method of  anchoring an anchor element in a hole substrate using  the cartridge.
