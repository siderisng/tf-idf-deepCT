<ABSTRACT>
a composite hair simulating fiber with characteristics  similar to human hair which includes a metallic core member  (20) coated with a plastic material (30) to form a fine  strand, the core member and/or the coating member being  flattened to provide a strand which will have a curling  characteristic with a self-retaining form which can be readily  styled by an operator to provide various curves and  convolutions as desired similar to that capable in human  hair but with greater extension and retention properties.
