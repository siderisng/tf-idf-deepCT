<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector comprises an electrical terminal  (9) having a contact end (10) and a crimping ferrule (11) for  connection to an electrical conductor (12, 13), the crimping  ferrule (11) being received in a metal sleeve (1) which  extends beyond the end of the crimping ferrule (11) in the  direction away from the contact end (10) of the terminal (9),  the metal sleeve (1) in turn being received in an outer sleeve  (8) of electrically insulating material.  the metal sleeve (1) is a  seamless member having a relatively thick wall over the portion  (2) overlying the crimping ferrule (11), and a relatively  thin wall over the portion (3) extending beyond the end of the  crimping ferrule (11).  the different thickenesses of the two  portions of the metal sleeve ensure reliable crimping of the  connector to an insulated conductor at these two positions.
