<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a method for selecting a cheese  starter culture resistant to bacteriophage present in a cheese  factory, and to apparatus for use in the method.  to test and thereby select a blend of strains not suscept­ ible to the current bacteriophage in the cheesemaking plant  the cheesemaker inoculates each of a multiplicity of recepta­ cles (12) with an inoculant containing phage then present in  the cheese factory.  a suitable inoculant is filtered whey  obtained from current production.  each receptacle (12) con­ tains a genetically distinct starter culture strain or a culture  blend in a sterile milk medium and contains a dye which will  change colour in the desired ph range.  after incubation for a  period of, for example, ten hours the cultures resistant to the  prevailing phage will exhibit the desired colour change and  will have developed a firm curd.  a starter culture known to be  resistant to the prevailing phage can now be selected.
