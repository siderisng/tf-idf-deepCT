<ABSTRACT>
compounds of formula (1):    wherein:   r₁ is hydrogen or fluorine;   r₃ is aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl, or c₁-c₂  alkoxycarbonyl;   and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are effec­ tive agents in weight control in mammals.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
phenethanolamines, their formulations, use and preparation this invention relates to phenethanolamine derivatives, pharmaceutical formulations containing those compounds, methods of preparing the novel compounds and their use in weight control of mammals. some of the most extensive efforts in basic research have been in the area of -phenylethylamine derivatives, many of which are catecholamines. a great deal of study, for example, has been carried out on the naturally occurring catecholamine epinephrine. epinephrine is a potent sympathomimetic drug and a powerful cardiac stimulant. the use of epinephrine is limited, however, due to its undesirable side effects, which include fear, anxiety, tremor, tenseness, throb bing headache, increased blood pressure, dizziness, respiratory difficulty and palpitation, as well as its short duration of action. the use of drugs which cause more than one biological effect can be very dangerous. for example, since both bronchodilation and cardiac stimulation are mediated by the broad group of receptors known as 9-receptors, a drug acting on such ss-receptors not only would effect bronchodilation, but additionally could cause observable effects upon the heart. in fact, some individuals allegedly hav died from ventricular fibrillation caused by excessive 5- stimulation after using bronchodildtion agents; (see greendurg and mines, br. med. j. 1, 563 (1967)). the cardiac effects of phenethylamxne aerivatives has long been known--see for instance u.s. patent specification no. 3,816,516 which describes the (3-agonist properties of certain l-phenyl-2-alkylaminoalkanol derivatives similar to the compounds of the invention. the applicants have now discovered that surprisingly certain para-substituted n-phenylpropyl phenethanolamines are effective in causing loss, or preventing formation, of adipose tissue in mammals and that this hitherto unsuspected activity in this type of compound is obtained with minimal associated cardiac effects. according to the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula (i): emi2.1 wherein: r1 is hydrogen or fluorine; r3 is aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl, or c1-c2 alkoxycarbonyl; or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. in one aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises a compound of formula (i), or a pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier therefor. whilst the compounds provided by this invention are referred to generically as phenethanolamines, they will be systematically named herein as n-sub stituted-3-phenylpropylamines. for example, a compound having the above formula wherein r1 and r2 both are hydrogen and r3 is aminocarbonyl will be named herein as: n- (2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-3-(4-aminocar- bonylphenyl)propylamine. the asymmetric carbon atom, namely the carbon atom labeled "c" in the above formula, preferably * has the r-stereochemical configuration as described by cahn et al., experientia, vol. xii, pp. 81-124 (1956). the compounds provided by this invention can be prepared by any of a number of- methods involving well known and routinely used chemical processes. a preferred process involves the reaction of a styrene oxide (preferably optically active) with a 3-phenylpropylamine. according to this aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preparing a compound of formula (i) in which a styrene oxide of formula (it): emi3.1 where r1 is as defined above, is reacted with a propylamine
