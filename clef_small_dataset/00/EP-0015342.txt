<ABSTRACT>
a substrate bias regulator 11 useful for controlling a  variable output oscillator 12 and/or a substrate bias vol­ tage generator 13 ist provided to control the substrate vol­ tage on a semiconductor chip 10.  a series of field effect  transistors are arranged in a manner to sense the substrate  voltage and to provide an output to regulate the substrate  voltage.  one of the series field effect transistors 16, 32 has  its gate electroce connected to reference potential ground  which tends to make the regulator independent of tran­ sistor thresholds.

<DESCRIPTION>
substrate bias reguror this invention relates, in general, to seluiconductor substrate bias circuits, and more particularly, to a regulator to regulate substrate bias voltage generators. to achieve high performing dynamic random access memories (ram) a negative substrate voltage is required. in dynamic rams certain nodes are charged to a given voltage. these nodes do not have-a current source and must therefore be periodically, e.g. every 2 milliseconds, refreshed or recharged. these nodes are capacitively coupled to the semiconductor substrate and since much of the capacitance associated with these nodes is substrate capacitance, the voltage on the nodes will change approximately directly with substrate voltage changes. in the past, in some cases, a negative voltage was applied from an external power supply to the substrate. however, this required an extra power supply which was inconvenient, especially-, for single power supply devicos. to eliminate the requirement of an external power supply, ring oscillators were built on the substrate and used to drive a charge pump or bias voltage generator which would supply a negative voltage to the substrate. a disadvantage to this approach is that the substrate voltage would then vary when the semiconductor chip power supply varied. sometimes the substrate bias voltage would tend to vary a greater amount than the power supply voltage variation. accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved substrate bias regulator to regulate the substrate bias voltage of a semiconductor chip to a predetermined ratio of the power supply of the chip. another object of the present invention is to provide a substrate bias regulator which is useful in mininizing the high output impedance effects of a substrate bias voltage generator. yet another object of the present invention is to provide a substrate bias voltage which varies percentage wise the same amount as the supply voltage varies. summary of the invention in carrying out the above and other objects of the present invention in one form, there is provided a substrate bias regulator for controlling the output of an oscillator and a substrate bias voltage generator. the regulator comprises a series of field effect transistors for producing an output bearing a relation to the substrate voltage. one of the series of field effect transistors has its source electrode coupled to the substrate for sensing the voltage-of the substrate. this same field effect transistor or another one of the series of field effect transistors has its gate electrode coupled to a reference. the series of field effect transistors produce an output which is coupled to an amplifier. the amplifier amplifies the output so that the output may be useful in controlling the output of the oscillator and the output of the substrate bias voltage generator. the subject matter which is regarded as the invention is set forth in the appended claims. the invention itself, however, together with further objects and advantages thereof, may be better understood by referring to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. brief description
