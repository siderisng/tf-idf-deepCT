<ABSTRACT>
hitherto the commercial production of a gear crimped  polyester yarn has not proved practicable due to extremely  low bulk in the yarn and inadequate yarn mechanical proper­ ties.  there is now provided a drawn gear-crimped polyester  yarn with latent bulk the amount and nature of the bulk being  such that the yarn has an initial crimp as defined of at least  1. 5%, preferably of above 2%, and a mechanical crimp stabil­ ity as defined of above 0%.  the crimped polyester yarn may  be produced by heating a drawable polyester yarn (9) having a  birefringence in the range 32 x 10⁻³ to 125 x 10⁻³ inclusive,  preferably 35 x 10₋³ to 125 x 10⁻³ inclusive, crimping the yarn  by guiding it between the intermeshing teeth of a set of  toothed wheels (11,19) such that the yarn is caused to follow a  sharply zig-zag path, the toothed wheels being rotated at a  sufficient speed such that the yarn is drawn by the tension so  imparted to the yarn by the toothed wheels and subsequently  forwarding the crimped yarn from the toothed wheels under a  controlled tension within the range 0. 15 to 0. 50 g per decitex  inclusive based on the decitex of the drawn polyester yarn.
