<ABSTRACT>
in a method and apparatus for timely determination of  potentially harmful biocidal gas leakage from a pressurized  chamber during sterilizing operations, biocidal gas make-up  values are monitored during the sterilizing phase to provide  prompt warning of biocidal gas leakage.  the timing of prese­ lected pressure decrement gas make-up charges (along 92)  are measured and compared to minimum acceptable gas  make-up charge times.  in addition, absorption of biocidal gas  by the load can be compensated for, if timing along the first  pressure decrement (along 84), in sterilizing operations where  load absorption is a significant factor.  also, gas absorption by  the load can be predicted from steam absorption data ob­ tained during pressure-controlled conditioning cycles, by mon­ itoring steam introduction (along 34).
