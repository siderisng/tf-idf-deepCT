<ABSTRACT>
a lubricating oil composition formulated to exhibit  improved rust and corrosion-inhibiting properties and com­ prising, in addition to lubricating oil, an oxyalkylated sorbi­ tan triester of a fatty acid and an oxyethylated alkylphenol.  the invention further includes an additive concentrate  formulated for addition to lubricating oil and containing, for  corrosion-inhibiting purposes, both an oxyethylated sorbitan  triester of a fatty acid and an oxyethylated alkylphenol.

<DESCRIPTION>
bubricating oil composition and additive concentrate for addition to bubricaxing oil this invention relates to a lubricating oil composition and an additive concentrate for addition to lubricating oil; and the invention is concerned, in particular, with the provision of an improved oil for crankcase service for internal combustion engines. oils for such service commonly contain various additives which serve different functions. ashless dispersants are added to prevent deposition of engine sludge. zinc dihydrocarbyldithiophosphate is added to inhibit wear and provide antioxidant protection. alkaline earth metal alkylbenzene or petroleum sulfonates function as high temperature detergents. over-based alkaline earth metal sulfonates or salicylates provide both detergent action and an alkaline reserve to protect engine parts against corrosion. the use of certain surfactants for lubricating oil is discussed in u. s. patents nos. 3,509,052 and #,928,2l9. these include certain oxyalkylated polyols, oxyalkylated ethylenediamine, nonylphenyl polyethylene glycol ethers and the like. furthermore, u. s. patents nos. 4681,315 and 2,833,717 disclose the use of oxyethylated alkylphenols in oil as corrosion inhibitors. in addition, u. s. patent no. 2,921,027 discloses the use of oxyethylated sorbitan monoesters. the actual products employed are "tweens" specifically tween 80 and tween 81, both being mono-esters differ which only/in their degree of oxyethylation. anticorrosion properties are demonstrated using the "static water-drop test" and it is made absolutely plain that only the polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleates meet the requirements of this test. indeed, the disclosure of this u. s. patent is very definite in its teaching of the use of mono-esters, the only thing being varied being the degree of oxyethylation of such esters. the present invention is founded upon the unexpected discovery that the rust and corrosion-inhibiting properties of lubricating oil are significantly improved by addition of the combination of an oxyalkylated sorbitan tri-fatty acid ester and an oxyalkylated alkylphenol, especially an oxyethylated alkyl phenol. a preferred embodiment of the invention is a lubricating oil composition comprising a major amount of lubricating oil and a minor corrosion-inhibiting amount of the combination of (a) an oxyalkylated sorbitan triester of a fatty acid and (b) an oxyethylated c4#l2 alkylphenol. while the present invention is particularly suitably applied to crankcase oils, the invention is not limited to such use and can be applied whenever lubricating oils are used for lubrication. the oxyalkylated sorbitan triester can be made by esterifying one mole of sorbitan with about three moles of fatty acid. preferred fatty acids contain about 10-20 carbon atoms. examples of these are decanoic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, tall oil acids and the like. the most preferred fatty acid is oleic acid or mixtures of fatty acids containing substantial amounts of oleic acid. esterification can be conducted by known methods such as by heating a mixture of sorbitan and fatty acid to distill out water. a distillation aid such as xylene can be used. the reaction forms a mixture in which the principal component is the triester although minor amounts of di- and tetraester might form. these will not interfere with
