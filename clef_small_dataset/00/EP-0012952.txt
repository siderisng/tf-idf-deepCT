<ABSTRACT>
a laser beam scanning system includes a laser beam  generator (8), a modulating unit (14) and a deflecting system  (16).  the laser beam generated in the generator (8) is divided  in the modulating unit (14) into two or more scan beams  which are scanned by the deflecting system (16) over a sur­ face (18).  the intensity of each scan beam is modulated in the  modulating unit (14).  the scan beams are scanned over the surface (18) in a  plurality of parallel scan lines, equally spaced apart.  the area  covered by each scan beam is wider than the distance bet­ ween adjacent scan lines so these areas overlap.  in order to avoid interference between adjacent scan beams  the modulating unit (14) and the deflecting system (16) are  arranged so that adjacent scan beams do not actually overlap  during the scanning along the scan lines.
