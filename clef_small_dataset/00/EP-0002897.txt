<ABSTRACT>
self-discharging vehicle, for example a feed trailer for  agricultural use, has a tippin body (12) and a power driven  discharge impeller (16) which is mounted on the vehicle  chassis (11) (not on the body [12]) adjacent an edge part  of a wall (13) of the body (12) which part becomes the  lower edge of its discharge mouth when it is tipped.  during  tipping the material is progressively displaced towards  the impeller (16) which throws it clear, preferably to one  side of the direction of travel.  it is also preferred that the  body (12) is raised during tipping and the impeller (16)  is positioned at sufficient height to discharge the material  over the top of feed fences of agricultural stock yards.
