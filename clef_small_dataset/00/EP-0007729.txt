<ABSTRACT>
a circuit which uses a digital averaging technique to filter  a composite analog signal is disclosed.  an analog-to-digital  converter (2) receives a composite analog signal and provides  a digital output signal which is received by an addersubstrac­ tor circuit (18) and by a sample register (12) which stores the  digital output signal for a predetermined number of sample  periods before providing the stored signal to the adder/sub­ tractor.  a storage register (20) stores a running average equal  to the sum of the digital signals received during the most  recent predetermined number of sample periods, and the  running average is fed back to the adder/subtractor.  during  each sample period, the adder/subtractor adds the current  digital output signal to the running average and subtracts the  delayed signal output by the sample register.  the result is  stored in the storage register as a new running average.
