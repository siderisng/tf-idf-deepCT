<ABSTRACT>
in a pulsator device of the slide valve type for milking  cows with each of the valves being operated by a pair of  diaphragms driven by a vacuum applied from outside, the  initial adjustment or gauging, after a certain period of  working, is no longer present and it is not possible to cor­ rect the gauging at the place of working.  furthermore, such pulsators cannot be used for milk­ ing ovine animals if they have not been suitably gauged at  the works originally.  in order to prevent the device from getting out of tune  and therefore changing the rate of operating and in order  to make it possible to renew the gauging at the place of  working and to alter it if it is desired to use the apparatus  for ovines also, instead of expelling the air which happens  to be present on the other side of the diaphragms, said air  is made to move in a closed circuit through a pipe (31)  which links the two chambers concerned (29 and 30) with  the opening of the passage which is adjustable from out­ side.
