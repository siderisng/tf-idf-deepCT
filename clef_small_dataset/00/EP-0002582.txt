<ABSTRACT>
a roller conveyor includes driven rollers, drive to which  is transmitted through resilient drive belts (8) looped about  the rollers and about drive sleeves (26, 27, 28) carried for  rotation on and frictional engagement with a drive shaft (20),  which extends longitudinally of the conveyor and adjacent  the rollers.  the drive sleeves consist of tubes carried on the  shaft on nylon bush bearings (31, 32) and are restrained from  axial movement along the drive shaft and the drive belts are  in direct engagement with the surface thereof to assume a  stable position thereon.  when an article being transported is  halted by external means the frictional drag between the  bushes and the shaft is exceeded and the sleeve beneath the  article and all associated rollers stall, thus preventing further  articles being transported by those rollers.
