<ABSTRACT>
in apparatus for the automatic infusion of labour-inducing  drugs during childbirth, in which the dose rate is  steadily increased until a particular level of contraction activity  is detected and then held constant, this constant rate can  result in over-stimulation of labour.  the improvement comprises  the inclusion of a dose rate control system in which  the duration and periodicity of the labour contractions are  detected in the form of a pulse train (curve 35) from which a  signal (curve 36) is produced by integration, which signal is  representative of the average value of the mark-space ratio  of the pulse train.  this average value is compared with a  predetermined value (48, curve 36) and the dose rate is  increased or decreased according to whether the average  value is less or greater than the predetermined value.
