<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for treating fibrous plant material,  preferably straw, with aqueous alkali solution, preferably  soda lye.  the straw is supplied at the bottom of a container (1)  filled with aqueous alkali solution which is characterized in  that it has no uniform alkali concentration but an alkali gra­ dient such that the alkali concentration is highest at the bot­ tom of the container (1) and lowest at the top thereof.  while  rising upwardly in the container by its own buoyancy, the  straw is thus treated with aqueous alkali solution of succes­ sively decreasing concentration.  finally, the straw is removed  from the top of the container (1) and flushed.  in the flushing  operation only so much fresh flushing water is supplied as  corresponds to the liquid absorbed by the straw.  as a result, a  closed system in respect of the treating liquid will be obtained.   the container has supply means (2) for supplying plant mater­ ial (3) and lye of high concentration (5) at the bottom and a grid  (9), conveying means (11) and flushing means (13, 16) for the  plant material at the top.  besides, the container has at least  one levelling vessel (17) between the top and the bottom for  adjusting the liquid level in the container upwardly and  downwardly by supply and withdrawal, respectively, of liquid  and resultant control of the level of the straw column in the  container.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for treating fibrous plant material this invention relates to a method and an apparatus for treating fibrous plant material (such as straw, reed, bagasse, threshed corn-cobs, forest products, especially hardwood of loose structure, etc.) with aqueous alkali solution, preferably sodium hydroxide solution. by treatment with alkali, fibrous plant material, such as straw, can be made more useful as animal feed, and the nutritive value of the material significantly increased. thus the nutritive value of straw used as animal feed can be more than doubled. two important effects are realized by treating straw with alkali. on the one hand, the structure of the fibres is influenced in such a way that the animals can better digest and exploit the nutritive substances in the straw and, on the other hand, the appetite of the animals is stimulated by the structure and alkali content of the straw, whereby they consume more feed and production is increased. the original method of improving the value of the straw is the so-called beckman method of 1921, which is described in german patent 305,641. according to this method, straw is soaked for 20 to 24 hours in a 1.58 sodium hydroxide solution, whereupon the straw is repeatedly flushed with fresh water. this method in its original form is laborious and besides is associated with several other serious drawbacks. one serious drawback is the large water consumption in the flushing of the straw soaked in lye (5,000 to 10,000 litres per 100 kg of dry straw). this disadvantage is the more serious as the available water catchments are often exploited already to their maximum. in areas with limited water supply a straw soaking method requiring large volumes of water of course cannot even be considered. another very serious drawback which is associated with this method is that large amounts of polluted waste water must either be discharged with the ensuing risk of interference with the natural environment, or be collected and destroyed, which cannot be made without incurring high costs. moreover, a great proportion of the nutritive substances contained in the straw will be lost, which is true of the substances which are soluble in water or in weak alkaline water solution. not less than 20 to 30% of the dry solids content of the straw are carried along by the flushing water. this- heavily biologically active "waste" is a source of serious contamination. the straw soaking process according to the above described beckman method thus brings substantial disadvantages, such as a large water consumption, loss of substances which have been leached out of the straw, and a need of discharging large volumes of polluted liquids which comprise both spent treating solutions and washing liquids and may contain alkali residues as well as substances leached out of the straw or particles suspended in the liquid, said liquids being usually discharged into watercourses, resulting in a serious interference with natural environment. the majority of said disadvantages are eliminated by the -straw soaking process disclosed by swedish
