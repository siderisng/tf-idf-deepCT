<ABSTRACT>
1.  noise guards arranged between posts along roads, squares, etc and joined together to form a noise suppressing wall, at least one sound absorbing plate (8) being spaced from the rear wall (5) of each shell member (1) and covered towards the sound source by a sound permeable cover (9) engaging by a bent-over edge (10) in a slot (12') parallel to edge (2) of shell member (1) and held by a connecting strip (13) with a leg (13') engaging over the edge of the cover (9), characterized in that a second slot (12) open in the same direction is provided parallel to the first slot (12'), connecting strip (13) being secured in the second slot (12), whilst the adjacent slot (12') receives, with tolerance, the bent over edge (10) of cover (9), the latter being resiliently, but displacedly held between leg (13') of strip (13) and the contact surface (3''), which is parallel thereto.
