<ABSTRACT>
a continuous process for producing a vinyl acetate-ethylene  copolymer emulsion comprises continously  charging a reaction mixture containing inter alia vinyl acetate  and ethylene into an initial polymerization zone, conducting  an initial polymerization of the vinyl acetate and ethylene in  the presence of a seed latex under ethylene pressure,  continuously removing the thus formed emulsion from the  initial polymerization zone at an unreacted vinyl acetate  monomer content of from 5 to 20% by weight of the  emulsion and a glass transition temperature of from minus  20°c to plus 10°c and then effecting a post polymerization of  the unreacted vinyl acetate at an ethylene pressure of not  more than 300 psia until the unreacted vinyl acetate in the  emulsion is less than 1% by weight.
