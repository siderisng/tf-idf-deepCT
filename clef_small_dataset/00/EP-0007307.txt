<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an agricultural pesticide includ­ ing as its chief material lime saccharate obtained by bonding  lime and saccharose, and further relates to a method of pre­ paring such pesticide.  a bordeaux solution obtained by mix­ ing and reacting the agricultural pesticide of the invention  with an aqueous solution of copper suphate gives a clear,  blue solution which, upon being spread over agricultural  crops, does not remain as residue and undergoes a reduction  in toxicity.  it is also possible to simplify the adjustment and  preparation of the bordeaux solution.  in addition, a mixture of  the lime saccharate (strongly alkaline) with an aqueous solu­ tion of an acidic agent for spreading over crops can be used as  an agent for adjusting ph in agriculture.  moreover, an aque­ ous solution of the water-soluble lime saccharate is effective  for use as a calcium replenisher to be applied to the leaves of  crops.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field the present invention relates to agricultural chemicals in which the essential main component is calcium saccharate. more particularly, the present invention relates to agricultural fungicides consisting of bordeaux mixture obtained by reaction of calcium saccharate with an aqueous solution of copper sulfate, a pls controlling agent composed of calcium saccharate which is used by adding to acidic spraying plant nutrients or fungicides or a calcium supple menting agent which is sprayed on plants in an aqueous solution of calcium saccharate. background art heretofore, milk of lime or an aqueous.solution of calcium hydroxide has been utilized for a large number of agricultural chemicals. for example, bordeaux mixture prepared by mixing and reacting mi 'k of lime or an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide with an aqueous solution of copper sulfate has an reliabie activity and a long maintaining abilty, so that bordeaux mixture has been broadly used from old. howevar, since milk of lime is used, noticeable chemicals traces are remained on the sprayed plant surface, for e;:ap e, en grape fruit surface to produce stained fruit. whwre the stain is wiped, the white powders (@@@@@@@@ to @) blooms) showing the freshness of the fruits are removed @ the fruit grains may be dropped by the wiping operation, @@ further light is shut out by the chemicals trec@@ pray@@ on plant surfaces, so that the photosyntnesis on the leaf surfaces is retarded. one of the reasons why various substitutive copper agents, such as basic copper chloride, cuprous oxide, copper silicate, copper phosphate: basic copper acetate, am on a copper, copper carbonate and the like have been develope in spite of secure activity of bordeaux mixture, is based on the fact that the preparation of border ni mixture is troublesome. namely, quick lime is converted into slaked lime milk by using a long time and the slaked lime milk is cooled and then filtered through a fine sieve and the cake is removed to prepare milk of lime and a separately prepared large amount of aqueous solution of copper sulfate is gradually added thereto and then the resulting mixture is stirred, so that a fairly long time nd much labor are needed. furthermore, the conventional usual bordeau mixture is apt to cause precipitation so that the mixture should be always stirred during the spraving operation and furhter hard particle of lime cakes are necess@ri@@ mixed and these particles wear pump system, particular nozzles usual bordeaux mixtures cause acute phytotoxicity depending upon the plant kind and the growing stage. heretofore, in order to avoid the noticeable stain due to bordeaux mixture, bordeaux mixture using an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide, tiat is supernatant liquid dissolving a slight amount of calcium hydroxide (0.133% by weight dissolved in water at 10 c as calcium oxide, when the temperature is raised, the dissolved content reversely decreases) has been used but the absolute amount of calcium hydroxide dissolved therein is small, so that a sufficient concentration of bordeaux mixture can not be obtained and the
