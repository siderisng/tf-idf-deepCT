<ABSTRACT>
getter assembly for a cathode ray television picture  tube which minimizes arcing currents within the tube.  the  getter assembly comprises a metal receptacle (40) with an  annular channel (44) in its floor member (50), the side wall  (48) of the receptacle (40) being relatively higher than the  elevated centre portion (42) of the floor member (50) cir­ cumscribed by that channel (44), a wire support member  (60) depending from the receptacle (40) for contacting the  inside wall (20) of a cathode ray tube and having its ends  (64, 68) located beneath that floor member (50) inwardly  from that side wall (48).  when the getter material (46)  tained in the channel (44) is flushed it will not be deposi­ ted in the shade area beneath the receptacle where the  support member (60) contacts the inside resistive coating  thus preventing short circuitry between the getter assembly  and the getter material deposit.

<DESCRIPTION>
getter assembly for cathode ray tubes the present invention is directed to a getter assembly for use in television picture tubes. more particularly the present invention is directed to a getter assembly which functions to minimize potentially destructive electrical arc currents in television picture tubes. the problem of electrical arcs and arc currents in television picture tubes is well known and described in detail in the prior art, for example u.s. patent 4,101,803. as noted in this patent and elsewhere in the prior art, conductive coatings provided on the inside and outside of the funnel portion of television picture tubes constitute a large capacitor which filters the high voltage which is applied to the screen of the television picture tube. the innder conductive coating is at the same potential as the screen and transmits the screen voltage to the neck of the picture tube where it is applied, e.g., by spring contacts, to a high voltage anode electrode at the forward part of the electron gun. the various electrodes in the electron gun are closely spaced and at widely different electric potentials. this circumstance, as is well known, results in arcing between the electrodes in the event that foreign particulate matter occurs in an inter-electrode space or if there is an improperly spaced electrode. in the event of an arc, the filter capacitor formed by the conductive coatings on the inside and outside of the picture tube funnel dumps its enornous stored charge within a few microseconds resulting in instantaneous currents on the order of hundreds of amperes and higher which can cause destruction of associated circuitry. a known technique for reducing the magnitude of the arc currents is to employ a resistive coating on the inner surface of the picture tube funnel, e.g., composition containing metal oxide, e.g., iron oxide. the resistivity of such coatings is relatively high, on the order of 2,000 to 6,000 ohms per square, and the arc current can be reduced on that account. however, in the gettering of television picture tubes, as is known to the art, a film of barium metal is deposited on portions of the inner funnel surface overlying the resistive coating and, at times, can provide a low resistance path and essentially short circuit the resistive coating. it is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a getter assembly which avoids the deposition of a short circuit barium film. this object is achieved by providing a getter assembly for cathode ray tubes comprising åa cylindrically shaped metal receptacle having an open top, a side wall member, an upraised bottom portion which with said wall member defines in said receptacle an annular channel having a floor member, the height of said wall member with respect to said floor member being substantially greater than the height of said upraised bottom portion, getter material within said annular channel, a wire support member depending from the bottom of said receptacle the ends of said wire support being bent inwardly toward each other,
