<ABSTRACT>
1.  storage hierarchy consisting of a first small high speed storage (51 in fig.  3) and a big low speed main memory (29) and a data register (55) connected via a first bidirectional bus (57) to the data processing unit (25) via a second bidirectional bus (59) to an error correction generator (61) which is connected via a third bidirectional bus (63) to the main memory (29), the busses and the data register (55) having a data flow width of one double word (8 bytes), and one page respectively comprising n double words being transferred between the main memory and the data register, characterized in that a first ring counter (a) is associated to the third bidirectional bus (63), a second ring counter (b) to the error correction bit generator (61), and a third ring counter (c) to the data register (55) and the high speed small storage (51), and that a fourth ring counter (d) is associated to the first bidirectional bus (57), and that the ring counters have n count stages each characterizing a double word in an associated position (61, 63, 55, 57).
