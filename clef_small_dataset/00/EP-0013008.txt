<ABSTRACT>
manufacture of alcohols containing 1 to 2 carbon atoms,  from the reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, by a  homogeneous catalytic process using as the catalyst a solubil­ ized ruthenium carbonyl complex, at temperatures between  50°c and 400°c and pressures between 35, 15 kg/cm² and  1054,6 kg/cm².

<DESCRIPTION>
this application is continuation-in-part of copending u.s. patent appjications serial summers 971,667 and 971,816, both filed december 21, 1q8, which applications aloe commonly assigned. process for producing alcohols this invention relates to an improved process, and the catalyst which achieves this process, for flaking ethylene glycol, methanol and ethanol directly from synthesis t7as i.e., mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. ore per ticularly, this invention achieves the production of ethylene glycol directly from synthesis gas using a ruthenium um carbonyl complex catalyst under process conditions which heretofore were regarded as being incapable of producing ethylene glycol with a ruthenium containing catalyst. this invention encompasses a process of producing ethylene glycol, methanol and ethanol directly from the reaction of synthesis gas in the presence of a stable ruthenium catalyst. the process of this invention is distinctive in the stabili- ty of the process, avoiding any significant loss of ruthenium um values from reaction. in addition, this process features a unique ruthenium containing catalyst, possibly mononuclear, for the catalytic process which produces ethylene glycol, methanol and ethanol. discussion of the prior art pruett and walker, u.s. patent no. 3,83f,634, patented september 3, 1974, based on an application originally filedl december 21, 1971, describe a process for preparing glycols by reacting an oxide of carbon with hydrogen using a rhodium carbonyl complex catalyst. the examples of the pa tent compare the reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of the desired rhodium containing catalyst and other metals. in example 9 of the patent, the reaction was attempted with triruthenium dodecacarbonyl as the catalyst using tetrahydrofuran as the solvent with a reaction temperature of 2300c, for 2 hours, and "the product contained no polyhydric alcohol." as will be shown below, pruett and walker apparently failed because they did not run at the conditions of reaction long enough and/or with enough ruthenium containing catalyst to achieve reaction to produce at least a detectable amount of a polyhydric alcohol such as ethylene glycol; see example 82, infra. example 82 employs substantially more ruthenium than did pruett and walker in their example 9. unquestionably, ruthenium is not as active a catalyst source to produce glycol as is rhodium under the conditions investigated. gresham, u.s. patent no. 2,535,060, describes a process for preparing monohydric alcohols by introducing carbon monoxide, hydrogen and a hydroxylated solvent into a reaction vessel and heating the mixture in the presence of a rutheni um-containing substance and an alkaline reagent; which controls the ph within the range of 7 to 11.5, at a temperature within the range of 150 to 300 c under a pressure within the range of suo to 1,ouo atmospheres. solid ruthenium dioxide is used in examples 1 and 2 of the gresham patent. experimental evidence (see example 83, infra) shows that gresham utilized a htero geneous reaction system. + at column 2, lines 30-33 of the patent, the see discussion of howk, et al, infra, d refer to catalysis, vol. 2, 1978, pp. 7-68, published by the chemical
