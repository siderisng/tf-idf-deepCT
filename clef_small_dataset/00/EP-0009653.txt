<ABSTRACT>
a wire enamel blend is disclosed which is made up of  four components: a crosslinkable polyester, a linear polyes­ ter, a polyester amide-imide component, and optionnally, a  cresol formaldehyde resin.  the cross-linkable polyester is  the reaction product of a polyol which is mixture of diol and a  triol, a polyfunctional carboxylic compound, and a catalyst.   the linear polyester is the reaction product of a diol, a  polyfunctional carboxylic compound, and a catalyst.  the  polyester-amide-imide component is the reaction product of  a diamine, trimellitic anhydride, and a polyester which in  turn is the reaction product of a polyol, a polyfunctional car­ boxylic compound, and a catalyst.  the cresol formaldehyde  resin is the reaction product of a phenol, formaldehyde, and  a amine catalyst.  all of the four components are in a solution  of a carbitol.  the blend also contains a fatty acid component which  may be reacted into any of its polyester components.

<DESCRIPTION>
polyester-amide-imide wire enamels polyester-amide-imide wire enamels which are used commercially are high molecular weight, high viscosity, difficultly soluble polymers requiring strong,.nox- ious solvents in large quantities, not only for application to wire, but also for proper reaction in the kettle. one widely used commercial polyester-amide-imide wire enamel is made by blending four reaction products (see u.s. patent 3,555,113): (1) a polyester-amide-imide with high amideimide content (which requires a high solvent content, specifically cresylic acid, in the reaction kettle to keep the reaction mixture mobile during critical periods of the reaction); (2) a polyester; (3) a polyurethane blocked isocyanate; and (4) a low molecular weight phenolic resin. the final resin is dissolved to 25% to 30% solids in a cresylic acid-aromatic hydrocarbon solvent mixture. the effluent from the stoving of this wire enamel is ecologically unacceptable and must be burned in an incinerator. u.s. patent specification no. 4,117,032 (kwiecinski), discloses a wire-coating powder prepared by first formulating a solventless aromatic polyester-amide-imide. excess polyol is used to replace the solvent. accordingly, the present invention resides in a polyester-amide-imide wire enamel blend characterized in that said blend comprises: (a) a solution in a carbitol. of a cross-linkable polyester comprising the reaction product of: (i) a polyol which is d niilil-e oi a and a triol; (2) a polyfunctional carboxylic compound at least 80% by weight selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, alkyl esters of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid up to c3, and mixtures thereof; (3) a catalyst; (b) a solution in a carbitol of a linear polyester comprising the reaction product of: (1) a diol; (2) a carboxylic compound at least 80% by weight selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, alkyl esters up to c3 of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid, and mixtures thereof; (3) a catalyst; and a solution in a carbitol of a polyester-amide-imide component comprising the reaction product of: (1) a polyester which comprises the reaction product of (a) a polyol which is a mixture of a diol and a triol; (b) a polyfunctional carboxylic compound at least 80% by weight selected from terephthalic acid; isophthalic acid, alkyl esters up to c3 of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid, and mixtures thereof; (c) a catalyst; (2) a diamine; and, (3) trimellitic anhydride; and, said polyester-amide-imide wire enamel blend also containing a fatty acid component which may be reacted into any of its polyester components. we have found that a polyester-amide-imide wire enamel blend having excellent properties can be made at a very high solids concentration using an ecologically acceptable solvent. the solvents used in this invention are carbitols, which are high-boiling and have been designated under rule 66 as ecologically acceptable solvents. the resin is applied to wire in the conventional manner and its properties on wire match those of good class 150so to class 1800c conventional wire enamels. the following is a description of the ingredients used in practicing this invention. solvent the solvent is a carbitol, that is, a diethyler;e
