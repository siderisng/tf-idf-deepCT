<ABSTRACT>
laundry detergent compositions containing specific  alcohol ethoxylate nonionic surfactants together with  selected di-long chain cationic surfactants, within a narrow  range of nonionic:cationic ratios, and which are either free of  phosphate materials and preferably polyethylene glycol  di-esters, or contain only low levels of such materials, are  disclosed.  these compositions are unusually effective in  removing particulate soils from fabric and, additionally,  provide fabric softening, static control, color fidelity, and dye  transfer inhibition benefits to fabrics laundered therewith.  a  process for laundering fabrics, using these compositions, is  also disclosed.
