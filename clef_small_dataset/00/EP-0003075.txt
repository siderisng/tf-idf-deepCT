<ABSTRACT>
n-amides of 2-benzothiazolinone have been found to be  effective in regulating the growth of leguminous plants.  the invention relates to a method of regulating the  growth of leguminous plants characterised by applying to  the plant locus an effective plant growth regulating amount  of an n-amide of 2-benzothiazolinone having the formula    wherein t is trifluoromethyl and halo, n is 0 or 1; m is an  integer from one to four; and r is selected from the group  consisting of    wherein x and y are independently selected from the group  consisting of hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl and trifluoromethyl;  r‚ÇÅ is hydrogen or lower alkyl; and (ii) heterocyclics  selected from the group consisting of morpholino,  cis- and trans-2,6-dimethylmorpholino, cis- and trans-2,5-dimethylpyrrolidino,  3-azabicyclo (3. 2. 2) nonyl, and ethyl-n-piperazinocarboxylate.  the invention also relates to a plant growth regulating  composition characterised that said composition comprises  from about 5 to 95 parts by weight of a 2-oxo-3-benzothiazoline-acetamides  as defined above.  novel 2-oxo-3-benzothiazoline-acetamides  are also part of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
n-pmides of 2-benzothiazolinone this invention relates to certain n-amides of 2benzothiazolinone and their use as plant growth regulants. more specifically, the invention relates to amides having the formula emi1.1 wherein t is trifluoromethyl and halo, n is o or 1; m is an integer from one to four; and r is selected from the group consisting of emi2.1 wherein x and y are independently selected from the grcp consisting of hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl and trifluoromethyl; r1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; and (ii) heterocyclics selected from the group consisting of morpholino, 2,6-cis- and trans-dimethylmorpholino, cis-and trans-2,5-dimethylpyrrolidino, 3-azabicyclo (3.2.2) nonyl, and ethyl n-piperazinocarboxylate. preferably, , is one. the term "lower alkyl" as used herein is understood to mean those alkyl groups having from one to five carbon atoms inclusive. it is contemplated that the term alkyl includes primary, secondary and tertiary alkyls. as a means of clarification, the heterocyclic moieties of the foregoing formula are defined below. the term morpholino is understood to mean a radical having the structure emi2.2 the term cis- and trans-2,6-dimethylmorpholino is understood to mean a mixture of radicals having the following structures emi3.1 the term cis- and trans-2,5-diethylpyrrolidino is understood to mean a mixture of radicals having the structure emi3.2 the term 3-azabicyclo (3.2.2) nonyl is understood to mean a radical having the formula emi3.3 and the term ethyl n-piperazinocarboxylate is understood to mean a radical having the formula emi3.4 in accordance with the novel aspects of the present invention, n-amides of 2-benzothiazolinone of the foregoing formula have been found to be effective in regulating the growth of leguminous plants, such as soybeans. the compounds are especially effective in altering the leaf morphology of leguminous plants. leguminous plants have canopies that effectively inhibit sunlight from reaching the lower leaves. for example, only about 50% of a soybean plant's leaves intercept light from photosynthesis. approxunately 85% of the light is absorbed by the outer layer of leaves. many researchers feel that by altering the morphology of the leaves such that the canopy is altered, light may fall more deeply into the canopy and yields could be increased. weber, in field crop abstracts, vol. 21, no. 4, pages 313-317, states that "greater light penetration, resulting in greater amount of the [soybean] plant canopy having a light intensity above 150 f.c., generally led to higher seed yields". johnson et al, in crop science, vol. 9, pages 577-581, states that "adding light increased the yields of bottom, middle and top canopy positions of [soybean] plants 30, 20 and 2%, respectively". thus, it would be highly beneficial if a method was found whereby the canopy of such plants could be altered such that a greater number of leaves could be illuminated. as noted, the amides of the present invention are effective plant growth regulants. they are especially effective in altering the leaf morphology of leguminous plants. the ters "plant regulant" or "plant growth regulant", as employed in this application, connotes a material which serves to modify the normal sequential development
