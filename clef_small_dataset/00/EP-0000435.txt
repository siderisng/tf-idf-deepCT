<ABSTRACT>
an ice making machine of the type comprising a water  tank (13) and freezing surfaces (18) such as fingers  which are periodically contacted with water in the tank (13)  to generate nodules of ice thereon includes an openable  closure (17) on a side of the water tank (13) interposable  under the ice on the freezing surfaces (18).  periodically,  the freezing process is stopped, the water level in the tank  (13) is lowered, the side closure (17) of the tank is opened  and positioned under the ice on the freezing surfaces, the  ice falling from the freezing surfaces (18) and being guided  to a storage compartment (2) by the side closure (17).
