<ABSTRACT>
a vehicular pneumatic tire which, except for bead cores  (14, 15) is composed solely of an elastomer blend strengthened  by molecular orientation.  the blend is a monoolefin  copolymer rubber with a polyolefin and sufficient curing  agents to effect vulcanization when the blend is subjected to  heat and pressure.  the process for making the tire comprises  preforming an annulus of the elastomeric blend with bead  cores (14, 15) adjacent the edges, the diameter of the preform  (10) being essentially that of the bead diameter of the completed  tire and the axial distance between the beads less than  the transverse arcuate dimension of the completed tire.  the  preform (10) is cured and while still hot following curing, is  stretched and shaped to final size and the generally toroidal  form characteristic of conventional pneumatic tires with  resulting biaxial molecular orientation, which orientation is  retained in the tire by cooling it below the melting point of the  polyolefin before removing the tire from the mold.
