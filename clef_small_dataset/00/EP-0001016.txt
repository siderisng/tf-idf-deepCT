<ABSTRACT>
an improved transparent electrophotographic element  of a conductive support overcoated with a photoconductive  insulating layer.  conductive coatings of the reaction  product of a metal salt and phosphorus sesquisulfide are  adherently bonded to or embedded into the support material  to form a stable conductive support that exhibits  excellent light transmission and uniform conductivity  throughout the element.
