<ABSTRACT>
a method of improving the processability of rigid  polymers, particularly of unprocessable rigid polymers,  wherein the rigid polymer in melt or solution form is  subjected to an apparent shear rate between relatively  moving surfaces of at least 100 sec⁻¹, particularly between  100 to 1000 sec⁻¹.  the method reduces the viscosity of the  melt or solution and when the melt or solution is fabricated  into shaped articles whilst the viscosity is so reduced the  shaped articles have improved properties, particularly more  uniform orientation when compared with products prepared  by methods which do not include the pre-shearing step prior  to fabrication.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of improving processability of rigid polymersthe present invention relates to a method of fabricating a shaped article after improving the processability of so-called rigid or stiff polymers to render them processable (as hereinafter defined). the invention is applicable to melts or solutions of the rigid polymers. some rigid-or-stiff polymers show a liquid crystal behaviour in the molten state. "thermotropic" liquid crystal behaviour has been described in respect of molten materials as being that which manifests itself within a particular temperature range. additionally, for solutions of some rigid polymers two types of system which show liquid crystal behaviour have been described; one which requires a critical mixture to show such behaviour (called "lyotropic") and another which requires a particular temperature range, as in the case of the molten materials, (called "thermotropic"). some rigid-polymers can form solutions which exhibit both types of behaviour. within its particular thermotropic temperature range, a rigid-polymer which is capable of showing thermotropic liquid crystal behaviour in the molten state will do so naturally, to yield a low viscosity melt which is readily extrudable with good inherent properties. similarly, when showing natural liquid crystal behaviour, rigid-polymer dopes are low viscosity, highly mobile liquids capable of being readily extruded at high concentrations and with good inherent properties. these low viscosity melts and solutions of the rigid polymer are defined herein as "processable". outside the physical bounds within which liquid crystal behaviour can be said to occur naturally, rigid-polymer melts or solutions cannot be fabricated into useful articles. the solutions or dopes are generally immobile, and tend to exhibit either a rubber-like consistency or a friable paste-like consistency. as such they are not readily extrudable, but if extruded result in grossly distorted and/or discontinuous extrudates. the melts will generally have a much higher viscosity (than in the liquid crystal form) and exhibit a yield stress. they will not be readily extrudable. if extruded they will give distorted and discontinuous extrudates. such polymer solutions and melts are defined herein as "unprocessable". apart from the physical conditions which determine whether rigid-polymer solutions and melts naturally show liquid crystal behaviour, modifications to the chemical structure of such polymers, for example, by introducing less rigid, i.e. flexible, chain segments, may prevent the occurrence of natural liquid crystal behaviour. such modified polymer solutions and melts are also defined herein as "unprocessable". a method has now been found of converting "unprocessable" melts or solutions into "processable" melts or solutions and fabricating shaped articles therefrom. the method also enables the processability of melts or solutions which are already "processable" as hereinbefore defined to be improved. accordingly there is provided a method of fabricating a shaped article from rigid polymers which are capable of exhibiting thermotropic or lyotropic behaviour characterised in that a melt or solution of a rigid polymer is subjected to pre-shear between relatively moving surfaces at an apparent shear rate within the range 100 sec⁻¹ to 1000 sec⁻¹ to reduce its viscosity relative to it's viscosity measured at a given temperature without pre-shear, the
