<ABSTRACT>
complexes of pyromellitic diimide compounds having  the formula    in which m is l and n is 1 or 2, or m is 2 and n is 1; r₁ is  hydrogen, lower alkyl, or hydroxy-substituted lower alkyl;  each of y and z which are the same or different, is hydrogen,  halogen or lower alkyl; x is oxygen, sulfur or imino; each of r₂  and r₃, which are the same or different, is hydrogen, lower  alkyl, amino, lower aminoalkyl or lower alkylamino; or r₂ and  r₃ are connected to form, with the intervening n and c atoms,  a 5-membered or 6-membered heterocyclic ring that contains  one, two or three nitrogen atoms and that is optionally substituted  with lower alkyl or hydroxy, are novel.  they are used as  ruminant feed additives to improve feed efficiency in ruminants,  and are included in compositions such as feedstuffs,  concentrates and veterinary compositions to that end.  they are made by contacting the appropriate diimide  with a complexing agent r₂nh-cx-r₃.
