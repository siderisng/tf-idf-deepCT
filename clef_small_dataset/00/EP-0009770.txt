<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and a method are provided in which a  connecting portion between sausage chubs is positioned in  an inner end of a slot in a guide structure and a blade unit is  then moved within the guide structure to sever the connect­ ing portion.  in one embodiment, two spaced blades (19,20)   are provided which can cut between facing surfaces (23,24)  of adjacent chubs (59,60) and the outer sides of clips (57,58)  on the ends of a connecting portion (56).  the blades are  pivotal and have beveled edges.  a spacer (28) between the  blades has a projecting portion (51) engaging the connecting  portion (56) to provide a tensioning action which facilitates  cutting.  in another embodiment, a single thin blade moves  between a pair of thin plates (77,78) of a guide structure (75)  for severing of a very short connecting portion (72) between  sausage chubs (73,74).  the blades may be operated manu­ ally as by fluid-operated cylinders, solenoids or other actuat­ ing means.
