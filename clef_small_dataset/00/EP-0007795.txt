<ABSTRACT>
a method of and apparatus for monitoring the operation  of a vehicle comprises sensing means in the form of one or  more mercury-containing capsules (12. 1, 12. 2) to sense  whether accelerative forces acting on the vehicle in the plane  of movement of the vehicle exceed or are less than a pre足 determined value, a pulse generator (20) operative in  response to the sensing means (12. 1, 12. 2) to generate a  number of pulses at predetermined intervals when the  accelerative forces exceed the predetermined value, a counter  (24) operative in response to the pulse generator (20) to gen足 erate a pulse count representative of the length of time for  which the accelerative forces have exceeded the predeter足 mined value, a timer (28) operative to be triggered in response  to the sensing means (12. 1, 12. 2) when the accelerative forces  exceed the predetermined value, a comparator (26) operative  in response to the counter (24) and the timer (28) to compare  the first signal with a predetermined signal a predetermined  period of time after triggering of the timer, and a recorder (30)  operative in response to the comparator (26) to make a record足 ing when the first signal is less than said predetermined  signal, and not to make a recording when the signal is equal to  the predetermined value.
