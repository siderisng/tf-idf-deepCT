<ABSTRACT>
guide troughs for leading molten products tapped from  blast furnaces or electric furnaces or the like.  a lengthy trough  body (1), formed in one block with monolithic refractories, is  provided with hook-engaging means in order for the body to  be lifted and transported.  the hook-engaging means com­ prises supporting pipes (2) which are laid longitudinally in the  upper portion of the body on both sides thereof; supporting  transverse members (3) which are disposed in an appropri­ ately spaced-apart relationship to interconnect the supporting  pipes on both sides of the trough body; and cut-out portions  (4) provided in the trough body at suitable locations to expose  the supporting pipes (2) to be engaged by hooks.  the fact that  the trough body has such stout supporting means and hook-­ engaging means which does not project from the upper sur­ face of the trough body as the suspension plates in the con­ ventional guide trough of this type, allows the following  advantages to be obtained.  namely, the hook-engaging  means is protected against radiant heat and splashing from  high temperature molten products flowing through the  trough.  this greatly enhances safety during transportation.  in  addition, as there are no objects projecting from the upper  surface of the trough body, the guide troughs can be stored by  stacking.  this permits a reduction in storage space.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification guide trough for molten products field of the invention this invention relates to improvements in guide troughs to be used for conducting molten products from a melting furnace, such as a blast furnace anu an electric furnace, and more particularly to a large size glide trough constructed in one block with monolithic refractory material. background of the invention in the recent tendency of the art, a long guide trough is constructed by stamping monolithic refractory material in one block instead of being constructed by brickworks, and transported and settled in the place where it is to be used. the method is also used for repairing the troughs, in which, when the inner surfaces of the troughs are worn by running molten products, whole of the trough is replaced with a new one instead of repairing by lining worn surfaces. such troughs are so heavy - some of them weigh about 1 ton or more - that the outside of the refractory body is reinforced by a supporting member, such as plates or frame works, which are usually provided with hook plates projecting upwards and having hook engaging holes for hanging the trough body. as the hook plates are projecting upwards from the trough body, hook plates are exposed to the heat radiation and splashes of the hot running molten products while in use, and this may weaken the hook plates and cause damages. further, piling up of the troughts in the storage is hindered by such projections. summary of the invention the guide trough of the present invention includes a long trough body m-de of the monolithic refractory material and provided with a runway for conducting molten products in the top surface; a supporting means for supporting saih trough body having a couple of holding beams buried at both side upper corners of said trough body and extending longitudinally, said holdinc; beams being connected with supporting cross members disposed at intervals; and a hook engaging means provided by removing a part of said trough body and exposing the holding beams for engaging hook means. thus a strong and rigid sporting and hook engaging means may be provided, as well as the hook engaging mesas does not project out from the trough body, so that it is not exposed to the heat radiation nor splashes of hot running molten products and the damages thereof can be prevented absolutely. also, the troughs may be piled up easily in the storage. the invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. brief description of the drawing fig.l is a side view of a trough according to the present invention; fig.2 is a cross-sectional view ten along line x-x of fig.l; fig.3 is a top plan view of the trough in fig.l; fig.4 is a partial front view showing one example of hook means; fig.5 is a side view of a trough of another embodiment of the present invention; fig.6 is a crgss-sectional view taken clong line y-y of
