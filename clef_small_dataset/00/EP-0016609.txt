<ABSTRACT>
the fixture for housing a lamp having an elongate axis  comprises an elongate housing (11) constructed from a  continuous rectangular piece of sheet metal having four  parallel bends therein forming planar side walls.  the planar  side walls (13, 15 and 17) form flange planes suitable for  mating within grooves formed in suitable end pieces for the  housing 11.  a closure lens (25) completes the housing.  the  construction of the elongated housing side walls is such that  a reflector sheet (27) when curvedly affixed to the two  outermost planar side walls (17) is tangential to the inner  three planar side walls (15 and 13), thereby providing a  parabolic reflecting surface for a lamp (12) mounted within  the housing (11).  two end wall reflectors, one of which is  preferably directionally adjustable, also reflect luminous flux  from the lamp.  an adjustable light support for the non-­ electrical end of the elongated lamp (12), along with the  adjustable end wall reflector, conveniently allows the light­ ing fixture to accept various sized elongated lamps without  substantial loss of light reflecting capabilities.
