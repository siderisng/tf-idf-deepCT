<ABSTRACT>
1.  a conveyor system for precisely guiding a film along a u-shaped conveyor path in a developing apparatus in fluids, comprising a plurality of conveyor rollers and a plurality of gear wheels which drive the rollers and which are arranged on extended end portions of the rollers, plates which are disposed normal to the axes of the rollers and between which the roller end portions are rotatably mounted in openings, and a main drive shaft which is provided with a main drive gear wheel and to which the other gear wheels are directly or indirectly coupled, wherein the two limb portions of the u-shape each have two rows of drive rollers, the axes of the drive rollers of respective ones of the rows are disposed in respective planes and the two planes of a respective limb portion of the u-shape are arranged parallel to each other, characterized in that the two planes of one limb portion of the u-shape and the two planes of the other limb portion of the u-shape are disposed at an angle to each other, that mounted on the roller end portions are bearing means which are mounted rotatably in openings at both sides of the rollers in respective pairs of plates (102a, 103a ; 102b, 103b) which are parallel to each other, and that the gear wheels are respectively arranged between the two parallel plates.
