<ABSTRACT>
a linear beam tube has an input section, a buffer or  buncher section, and an output section.  the buffer or  buncher section comprises two circuits in series, each of  which comprises two resonant cavities (c51 and c52)  through which the electron beam passes and a third reson足 ant cavity (c53) coupled to cavity (c51) by a slot (53) and to  cavity (c52) by a slot (54).  the output section comprises two resonant cavities (c1  and c2) through which the beam passes and which are cou足 pled by a slot (5).  a third resonant cavity (c3) is coupled to  cavity (c2) by an iris (13), and to an output waveguide (14) by  a further iris (15).  the input section may comprises a travelling wavetube  section, or the series arrangement of a standard klystron cav足 ity and two buffer sections.  slot or iris couplings may be replaced by a loop coupling  as known in the art.  the resulting amplifier has an improved bandwidth/effi足 ciency product.
