<ABSTRACT>
a liquid formulation for depositing perfumes on fabric  surfaces comprises an aqueous base, 0. 5 to 30% of a fabric  conditioning agent such as a fabric softener and 0. 5 - 50% of  particles consisting of an intimate mixture of an amine and a  perfume, the particles having a size of 0. 1 - 200 micron, pref­ erably 0. 1 to 5 micron.  the amine may be a primary amine, a  tertiary amine or a diamine.  the particles are formed from a  liquid melt of the amine and the perfume by dispersing in  water.  a benefit over particles consisting of non-ionic,  cationic and perfume can be demonstrated.

<DESCRIPTION>
liquid formulations field of the invention this invention relates to liquid formulations capable of depositing perfumes on fabric surfaces. the formulation may be used in diluted form and examples of the fabric surfaces are cotton, wool, polyacrylic, polyamide and polyester fibres. these formulations are intended for use in the rinse cycle of a fabric cleaning operation. the liquid formulations of the invention will normally be used to provide a fabric softening effect. perfumes are liquid compositions consisting of a number of organic compounds, capable of appreciation by smell. the compounds are usually derived from natural sources but synthetic materials are also used. formulations intended for the laundering of fabric will normally contain a perfume to provide a pleasant after smell on the laundered fabrics. thus powder and liquid detergent formulations, and rinse cycle formulations contain perfumes. it is desirable to have the perfume in a fabric treatment formulation used efficiently becau,ca it is a relatively high cost component of any formulation. in use the perfume will be present in the formulation at a relatively low concentration and dilution will cause the fabric to be in contact with a liquid system containing a very low concentration of the perfume. bacegrownd art vhe desirability of enhancing the effectiveness of perfumes nas been acknowledged in the patent literature. united sates patent specification no. 4 152 272 (young) describes a fabric conditioning composition comprising particles of a wax-like carrier and a perfume. british patent specification no. 1 544 863 (schilling et al) describes a fabric conditioning composition for use in an automatic laundry dryer comprising particles of a mixed cationic/non-ionic carrier and a perfume. in german patent application no. 2 732 985 of unilever limited a deposition system is described which provides increased deposition of materials providing a perceivable effect, for example perfumes. amines are disclosed as matrix materials, but a cationic material is required as an essential component of the dispersed phase including the perceivable component. disclostjre of the invention we have now discovered that surprising good perfume deposition on fabrics can be achieved without the incorporation of cationic materials in perfume-carrying amine particles. thus, according to the invention, there is provided a liquid formulation for depositing perfumes on fabric surfaces, wherein the formulation comprises an aqueous base having: : i) a first dispersed phase constituting from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight of the formulation and consisting of particles having an average size of from about 0.1 micron to about 200 microns, preferably 0.1 to 5.0 micron, the particles comprising an intimate mixture of (a) from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight, based on the weight of the particles, of a perfume, and (b) from about 50% to about 99.5% by weight, based on the weight of the particles of a matrix comprising at least one water dispersible amine of the formula r-nr1p2 where r is an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, r is hydrogen or an alkyl or alkx group having 1 to
