<ABSTRACT>
in a device for the fastening of eye-buttons (1) to a workpiece by means of two-pronged rivets, an upper die (18) movable towards a lower die (5) has a gripping means (19) for receiving the button part to be fastened.  in addition, a sorting bell and feed rail are in each case present for the parts to be manipulated in the lower and upper tool.  the eye-button (1) to be manipulated in the lower die (5) is presented in an inclined position with respect to the lifting movement of the upper die, with the underside of the button turned upwards.  for this purpose, an eye-button holder (7) with clamping jaw (8), which can be moved and pivoted by means of a feed slide (10) towards the associated feed rail (15), is provided.  <image>
