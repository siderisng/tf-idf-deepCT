<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for applying caustic liquid to grain com­ prises an auger (14) for transporting the grain and a sys­ tem supplying the liquid to a nozzle (22) in the auger inlet.   the liquid supply system comprises a positive displace­ ment pump (26) delivering liquid to the nozzle via an ad­ justable throttle valve (30).  a constant liquid pressure is  provided by a relief valve (36) which bleeds off excess li­ quid and returns it to the pump inlet.  a switch (40) on the  relief valve shuts down the auger and pump if the liquid  supply is too low, and a switch (20) responsive to the pre­ sence of grain in the auger shuts down the liquid supp­ ly and auger if the grain supply ceases.  alternative sensors  (44, 50) responsive to grain flow rate are disclosed for  switching off the auger or for varying the liquid flow rate in  accordance with the grain flow rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for applying liquid to particulate material this invention relates to the application of liquid to particulate material and especially to cereal grain. it is known to apply preserving liquid, usually propionic acid, to grain at relatively low rates (e.g. 1 - 2 gallons/ton) using gravity feed of the liquid from a container to nozzles in an auger for the grain. low output pumping may also be used, typically by means of a centrifugal pump. the advantage of this latter type of pump is that the outlet can be throttled as desired to adjust the flow rate. for higher rates of flow, however, (e.g, about 5 gallons/ton) a centrifugal pump is not so appropriate, but positive displacement pumps cannot usually be throttled down to any great extent to vary the flow rate. such higher flow rates are required for example in applying caustic solution to grain, which has the effect of chemically breaking down the cellulose fibre to make it easier for animals to digest, and also of preserving the grain in storage. however strong caustic solution is a dangerous material to use, so that apparatus for applying it to the grain should be designed to be suitably safe in operation. in the following description the term "grain will be used generically (unless otherwise indicated) to mean any particulate material to which liquid is to be applied. the apparatus of the present invention comprises apparatus for applying liquid to grain, comprising a motor driven auger along which the grain is to be transported from an inlet to an outlet, supply means for injecting liquid into the moving grain, and an auger sensor responsive to the flow of grain through the auger and arranged to vary or shut off the liquid supply in accordance with the sensed rate of flow or the absence of flow of grain. suitably the liquid is injected into the grain in the inlet before it enters the auger, so that the liquid is distributed in the grain by the mixing effect as the grain enters the auger. liquid can be supplied by a pump, the outlet of which is connected to a flow control throttle valve, a pressure relief valve being located so as to bleed off liquid when a predetermined pressure is reached and return the diverted liquid directly or indirectly to the, inlet side of the pump, thereby maintaining a substantially constant predetermined liquid pressure to the flow control valve so that the latter can be calibrated or adjusted by the auger sensor to determine the flow rate. the flow control valve can be fixed, to provide a given flow rate for a given liquid pressure. preferably, however., it is adjustable to vary the flow rate. the apparatus thus incorporates a safety mechanism whereby the supply of liquid is adjusted to the rate of flow of grain or is cut off if the supply of grain to the auger varies or if it falls to too low a level. cut off may be by

claims:   1. apparatus for applying liquid to grain, comprising a motor driven auger (14) along which the grain is to be transported from an inlet (12) to an outlet (46), and supply   means (22,26,36)    for injecting liquid into the moving grain, characterised in that an auger sensor (20,44,50) responsive to the flow of grain through the auger is arranged to vary or shut off the liquid supply in accordance with the sensed rate of flow or the absence of flow of grain, 2. apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the auger sensor (20) is arranged to respond to changes in the axial loading on the auger shaft resulting from variations in the rate of flow of grain through the auger.   3. apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the auger sensor (44) comprises a deflectable element (48) projecting into the path of the grain so that it is deflected by the moving grain to operate the switch.   4. apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the auger sensor (50) indirectly detects the grain flow rate by measuring the auger speed, the auger motor power consumption, or the auger shaft torque and provides a signal to a control unit (52) which causes the rate of flow of liquid to be varied in respdnse to the detected grain flow rate.   5. apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4 including a liquid supply switch (40) responsive to the pressure or flow rate of liquid supply s6 as to shut off the liquid supply if that supply becomes inadequate.     6. apparatus according to claim 5 wherein the auger sensor   (20)    and the liquid supply switch (40) are in series with each other and with the auger motor (16) and the liquid supply means (26) whereby operation of either the auger sensor or liquid supply switch in response to inadequate grain flow or liquid supply switches off both the liquid supply and the auger.      7    apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the liquid supply comprises a liquid pump (26) with a pressure relief valve (36) arranged to divert excess liquid when the liquid supply pressure reaches a predetermined level.   8. apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the liquid supply comprises a liquid pump (26) with a pressure relief valve (36) arranged to divert excess liquid when the liquid supply pressure reaches a predetermined level, the liquid supply switch (40) being associated with the pressure relief valve (36) so as to operate to stop the liquid supply if the relief valve closes as a result of inadequate liquid pressure on the output side of the pump.    9. apparatus according to claim 7 or claim 8 wherein a variable throttle (30,32,34) is provided in the liquid supply line to the auger downstream of the pump and relief valve, whereby the flow rate can be set by adjustment of the throttle acting on the preset liquid supply pressure from the pump.      10.    apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the liquid is injected into the grain in the inlet (12) before it enters the auger (14) so that the liquid is distributed in the grain by the mixing effect of turbulence in the grain as it enters the auger.
