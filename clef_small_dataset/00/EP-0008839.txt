<ABSTRACT>
a process for preparing compositions containing certain  quaternary ammonium compounds from tertiary amines  selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines contain­ ing one or two long-chain aliphatic groups, and mixtures  thereof, is disclosed.  the process comprises reacting the ter­ tiary amine with dimethyl sulfate, diehtyl sulfate, or trimethyl  phosphate.  the reaction is performed in a reaction medium  selected from the group consisting ofcompounds which have  a melting point below about 100°c.  preferably are capable of  dissolving the desired quaternary ammonium compound,  and which contain either (i) an ester linkage derived from a  fatty acid, (ii) a primary hydroxyl group, or (iii) both, and  mixtures of said compounds.  the reaction typically is per­ formed at a temperature between about 50°c and about  15°c for a length of time sufficient to convert at least a  portion of the tertiary amine to the desired quaternary  ammonium compound.  the compositions obtained in this  way can be utilized for conditioning clothes, such as in an  automatic laundry dryer.
