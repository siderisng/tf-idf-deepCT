<ABSTRACT>
 a novel antibacterial drug combination is provided, one  component being a fused ring β-lactam, such as thienamycin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives, and the other component is  a dipeptidase (e. c.  3. 4. 13. 11) inhibitor.  the dual-component  combination is formulated so that 1 to 3 parts by weight of the  β-lactam compound are employed for 30 to 1 parts by weight  of the inhibitor compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention: an'antibacterial composition or ienamvoin-type compound and a dipeptidase inhibitor. introduction: a new class of fused ring g-lactam antibiotics, including thienamycin and its semi-synthetic derivatives, epithienamycins, and olivanic acids, has recently been described. these compounds which will be defined more extensively below, are hereinafter referred to as the wthienamycin class of compounds". these compounds have a high level of antibacterial activity, but are subject to extensive metabolism by mammalian species. the kidney was identified as the primary site of metabolism, and an enzyme was purified from renal extracts which catalyzed the inactivation of thiena mycin by hydrolysis of the ss-lactam. by such criteria as cytological localization, substrate specificity and susceptibility to enzyme inhibitors, this enzyme is very similar if not identical to a widely studied renal dipeptidase (e.c.3.4.13.11), also referred to in the literature as wdehydro- peptidase-i". however, the ss-lactamase activity is exhibited only toward the thienamycin class of compounds. indeed, there exists no precedent example of the mammalian metabolism via ss-lactam cleavage of any representative of the classical &beta;-lactam antibiotics, the penicillins and cephalosporins. detailed description of the invention: thienamycins the term "thienamycin class of compounds" is used to identify any of a number of naturally occurring, semi-synthetic, or synthetic derivatives or analog compounds having a common fused-ring ss-lactam nucleus. these compounds can be generically classed as 6- and (optionally) 2-substituted pen-2-em-3-carboxylic acids and l-carbadethia-pen-2em-3-carboxylic acids or lazabicyclo 13,2.01hept-2- ene-7-one-2-carboxylic acids. specific compounds particularly useful in this invention are represented structurally in the following formula i: emi2.1 wherein x can be ch2 or st r2 can be hydrogen; 3 3 -s-ch2ch2nhr , wherein r3 is hydrogen, acetyl, formimidoyl, acetimidoylt -s(o)-ch=chnscochn and -s-ch=chnhcoch3; and r6 is emi2.2 wherein 7 is hydrogen, hydroxy or sulfonyloxy, or r6 is h. all possible stereoisomeric forms are included within the above structural definition. all of these compounds within formula i are described in the literature. when x is ch2, and r2 is sch2ch2nh2, and r6 is ch(oh)ch3, the compound is known as thienamycin, an antibiotic produced by fermentation of s. cattleya, deposited as nrrl 8057 at northern regional research laboratories, u.s. department of agriculture, peoria, illinois, u.s.a., on november 18, 1974 described and claimed in u.s. patent 3,950,357, issued april 13, 1976. the n-substituted derivatives of thienamycin, i.e., in the formula i above wherein r3 is other than hydrogen, are disclosed and claimed in co-pending u.s. applications and their published foreign equivalents. the fermentation product n-acetyl thienamycin (r6 is ch(oh)ch3, and r3 is acetyl), also called 924a, is claimed in belgian patent o. 8s,346, issued may 16, 1977. the n-imidoyl derivatives are covered in belgian patent no. 848,545, issued may 20, 1977. the unsaturated side chain-containing compound, also called n-acetyl-dehydrothienamycin or 924a5 is a fermentation product of s. cattleya, nrrl 8057 claimed in u.s. sn 788,491, filed april 18, 1977, case 16022, now ¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯ , and also in belgian patent no. 866,035, issued october 17, 1978. epimeric forms of n-acetyl thienamycin, also called 890a, and 890a3, as well as

what is claimed is:    1. an antibacterial composition comprising a combination of thienamycin-type compound and a dipeptidase   (e.c.3.4.13.11)    inhibitor, the ratio of the thienamycin-type compound to the dipeptidase inhibitor being within the range of about 1:3 to about 30:1.    2. the composition of claim 1 in which the combination is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier.    3. the composition of claim 2 in which the carrier is adapted for injection.    4. the composition of claim i in which the thienamycin-type compound is thienamycin.    5. the composition of claim 1 in which the thienamycin-type compound is   n- formimidoylthienamycin0     6. the composition of claim 1 in which the thienamycin-type compound is n-acetimidoylthienamycin.      7. the composition of claim 1 in which the dipeptidase inhibitor is a compound of the following formula: emi71.1       wherein r2 and r3 are hydrocarbon radicals in the range respectively of 3-10 and 1-15 carbon atoms; in either one of these r2 or r3 hydrocarbon chains 1-6 hydrogens may be replaced by halogens or a nonterminal methylene may be replaced by oxygen or sulfur, including oxidized forms of the latter; additionally, a terminal hydrogen in r3 can also be replaced by a hydroxyl or thiol group, which may be acylated or carbamoylated; or the hydrogen can be replaced by an amino group, which may be derivatized as in an acylamino, ureido, amidino, guanidino, or alkyl or substituted amino group, including quaternary nitrogen groupings;  or, alternatively, there may be replacement by acid groups such as carboxylic, phosphonic or sulfonic acid groups or esters or amides thereof, as well as cyano; or combinations thereof, such as a terminal amino acid grouping; and r1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl   (c1 6)    or dialkylaminoalkyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable cation.      8. the composition of claim 7 in which r2 can be r4, wherein r4 is branched or cyclic hydrocarbon of 3-10 carbon atoms;    -r5r61    wherein r5 is cycloalkyl of 3-6 carbon atoms and r6 is either 1 or 2 alkyl substituents which may be joined to form another ring on the cycloalkyl group or r6 is 1 or 2 chloro substituents;  -r7r8, wherein r7 is alkylene of 1-3 carbon atoms and   r8    is cycloalkyl of 3-6 carbon atoms; or  r2 can also be a straight, branched or cycloalkyl group of 3-10 carbon atoms including alkylcycloalkyl and dialkylcycloalkyl, providing the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl cannot be tertiary.     9. the composition of claim 7 in which r2 is   2, 2-dimethylcyclopropyl.       10. the composition of claim 7 in which r2 is 2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl.    11. the composition of claim 7 in which the dipeptidase inhibitor is   z-2- (2, 2-dimethylcyclo-      propanecarboxamido)-2-octenoic    acid.
