<ABSTRACT>
a bicycle caliper brake assembly comprises: a pair of  pivotal calipers resiliently urged outwardly, a pair of spaced  brake blocks (17, 18) secured to respective caliper ends so that  distance therebetween is adjusted by operation of a brake  lever through a control cable (15), wherein a rotator (25) is  adapted within one extremity (17) of the caliper (11) so as to  coaxially rotate with a lever (37) fixedly mounted thereon, and  a cable mounter (32), to which one end of the cable (15) is  clamped, has a cylindrical shaft (33) sandwiched between the  rotator and internal walls of said extremity, said shaft being  circumferentially shiftable by operation of the lever (37),  whereby the distance between the blocks (17, 18) is adjusted.
