<ABSTRACT>
an electron multiplier using a laminated channel  plate assembly.  the electron multiplier is usable in dis­ play tubes and image intensifiers.  a problem in channel plate electron multipliers is to  space apart accurately the dynodes in a simple and in­ expensive way.  in the present invention this problem is overcome by  using discrete separating elements (18) such as ballotini  to space apart the dynodes (11, 12, 13, 14).  the elements  (16) are bonded to the surface of one dynode of adjacent  pairs of dynodes and is either bonded to or clamped  against the other dynode of the pair.  various methods of making the laminated channel  plate assembly are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
"electron mujripliers" the present invention relates to electron multipliers and nore particularly to electron multipliers of the channel plate type which may be used in electronic imaging and display applications. in present practice a channel plate is a secondaryemissive electron multiplier device which can be in the form of a glass plate having a first conductive layer on its input face and a separate second conductive layer on its output face to act respectively as input and output electrodes and a large number of channels with resistive walls passing through its thickness so that the electric field inside each channel varies uniformly along its length. the nul'iplier device can also be in the form of a channel plate structure comprising a plurality of discrete dynode retail channel plates in a stack, each plate being separated from the others. different types of channel plate structures are known for example from british patent specifications 1,401,969, 1,or2,549 and 1,434,053. figures 5 and 6 of british patent specification no. 1,402,549 disclose the use of screen prated glass dots as a means of separating adjacent channel plates of a stack. in order to bond the plates together to form a channel plate structure it is necessary partly to melt the glass dots. a problem may arise here in that accurate spacing between the channel plates may be lost due to the glass dots cargirg shape when partly melted. in order to avoid this problem it is proposed in that specification to form spacing separating elements from a high melting point glass, which separating elements may be machined to an accurate thickness after application. thereafter bonding separating elerents of a low melting point glass are applied to the sare surface of each channel plate as the spacing separating elements. the plates are then arranged in a stack with the channels in the plates being aligned as desired and the stack is heated to a temperature to melt partly the low melting point glass bonding elements which bond themselves to the surface of an adjacent plate. in the case of plates not made of a secondary emissive material, for example mild steel, it is to provide a secondary emissive material in each channel. the repeated heating of the plates in order to apply high melting point and low melting point glass separating elements to the plates and the heating to bond the elements to adjacent plates can affect adversely the secondary emissive material. this can have the effect that the channels do not behave uniformly over the area of the channel plate structure. accordingly it is an object of the present invention to space apart accurately the channel plates in a reliable and simple way. according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a channel plate structure comprising a stack of discrete electrically conductive dynodes separated from each other by an array of discrete separating elements distributed across the area of the channel plate, which elements are less conductive than the dynodes. according to
