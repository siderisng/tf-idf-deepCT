<ABSTRACT>
an industrial battery powered truck includes a chassis (1)  on which is mounted a container (5) of a storage battery.  the  container has a hinged lid (9) which is pivoted at the top of the  ballast weight (11).  the lid (9) carries a driver's seat (12) and,  behind the driver's seat, a compartment (13) of electrical con­ trol gear for the truck.  the container (13) has an openable  cover (14).  a pneumatic piston and cylinder (17) is connected  between the ballast weight and the lid and provides force for  raising or assisting the rise of the lid.  the lid carries a console  in the position of an arm rest by the side of the seat.  the  console carries at least one electrical control which is manu­ ally operably by the driver and incorporates trunking for an  electrical cable between the manually operable control and  the aforementioned control gear.
