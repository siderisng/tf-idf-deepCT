<ABSTRACT>
a blank for a screwing die on which there is to be formed  a bore (4) having a screw thread (5) on its surface, includes  one or more shaped cavities (2; 32; 42) such that openings  (6) are formed between the bore and the remainder of the  cavities, the openings being flanked by land portions (7).  for  each of a variety of sizes of the bore a cutting edge (10)  having a positive rake angle of between about 5° and 15° is  formed on the leading edge of each land portion, and the  land portions (7) form in total between about 30% and 40% of  the bore circumference.  the cavities may have a leading edge (8; 48; 49) in the  form of an archimedes spiral or an edge (38; 39) made up of  a plurality of linear portions.  the cavities (2; 32; 42) may  have two such edges so that the die is reversible.

<DESCRIPTION>
this @@vention relates to screwing dies, and to novel form of @@ank from which auch dies may by produced. a known form of screwing die comprises a cylinder having an axial threaded bore therethrough upon which bore the cutting threads are formed. in this form of die, a plurality of similar circular holes are drilled parallel to the threaded bore, these holes being of such a diameter, and so positioned with their centres equidistant from the threaded bore, that these bores "overlap" (ie form openings into) the threaded bore. at an edge of each opening so formed1 there is thus created a cutting edge whose rake angle is determined by the diameter and positioning of the holes relative to the threaded bore. between these openings there remain lands upon which the cutting threads are disposed, the cutting edge being the leading edge of each land. for efficient cutting, the rake angle should normally have the same value irrespentive of the diameter of thread to be cut. ideally this will be in the approximate range 10 to 11 , at least at the leading end of the die where cutting commences, although values as low as 5 or as great as 150 can provide acceptable results. the choice of land dimensions will depend upon the diameter of the thread to be cut, and ideally will strike the optimum compromise between the ability of the die to resist breakage during use, and the provision of openings of adequate size to permit all waste material produced during cutting to be cleared through the openings without fouling the newly cut thread. the ideal relationship between thread diameter and land dimension is determined erpiricnlly, and data providing details of st,ch relationships for a variety of thread diameters will be familiar to those skilled in the art. normally the land area will account; for about 35-45% of the circumference of the threaded bore, although values down to 30% can give acceptable results. a disadvantage of the known form of die described above is that for each thread diameter there is only one predetermined size and configuration of axial holes which is suitable. the present invention seeks to make possible the provision of a single die blank from which dies for cutting various thread diameters and forms can be made simply by the formation therein of an appropriate threaded bor according to the present invention, a blank for a screwing die has a longitudinal axis on which is to be formed a bore having a screw-cutting thread on its surface, and one or lore shaped cavities extending though the blank in a generally longitudinal sense, the shap and disposition of the shaped cavities being such that for each of a variety of sizes of the bore, (i) one or more openings are formed through which the bore cornnnmicates with the remainder of the said one or more shaped cavities, said remainder being flanked by one or more land portions of the blank which carry the screw-cutting threads,
