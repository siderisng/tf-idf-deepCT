<ABSTRACT>
particulate, porous, water-insoluble amorphous po­ ly(silicic acid) which is characterized by an average pore  diameter of at least 100 å and a surface area of 500 to 850  m²/g, by an average pore diameter of 50 å to about 300 å and  a surface area of greater than 850 m²/g, or by a pore volume of  1. 5 ml/g to about 8. 5 ml/g and a surface area of greater than  850 m²/g; process for preparing particulate, porous, water-­ insoluble, amorphous poly(silicic acid) by acidifying an  appropriate aqueous silicate solution, allowing the silicic acid  thus formed to polymerize to poly(silicic acid), freezing the  acidified solution, and thereafter thawing the acidified solu­ tion and isolating therefrom, washing, drying and recovering  particulate poly(silicic acid), said process further character­ ized in that:   (a) the amount of silicate in the aqueous silicate solution  is such that the sio₂ content of the acidified solution is about 4  to 25 weight % and such that the acidified solution contains  about 15 to 150 weight %, based on the weight of sio₂, of at  least one water-soluble compound which is precipitable from  the acidified solution at -10 to -200°c and which is inert to the  silicate, silicic acid and poly(silicic acid);   (b) the aqueous silicate solution is acidified to a ph of  about 3 to 9; and   (c) the acidified solution is cooled to a temperature of  about -10 to -200°c until it is frozen to separate substantially  all of the chemically unbound water as substantially pure ice  and to precipitate water soluble compound within the pores of  the poly(silicic acid) particles being formed.
