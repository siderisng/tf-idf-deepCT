<ABSTRACT>
a process for separating tar and solid particles from coal liquefaction products using a highly selective halogenated aliphatic solvent which removes essentially all the tar and solid particles from the coal liquefaction products wherein a minimum amount of energy is used.  this is accomplished by contacting said coal liquefaction products with the halogenated aliphatic solvent to form two phases, one containing said tar and solid particles and the other containing said solvent and the remainder of said coal liquefaction products.
