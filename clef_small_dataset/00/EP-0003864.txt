<ABSTRACT>
a device which is slidably arranged on at least one  guide-rod (7) and provided with means (10, 12, 15) for securing  the device in an arbitrary position on the guide-rod (7).  in order to provide for the securing of the device on the  guide-rod (7) and also that the device can be somewhat resiliently  displaced on the guide-rod (7) and thereafter return to  its original position, the means for securing the device comprises  a spring (15) and a lever (10) the former of which is the  sole means of coupling the latter to the device, the lever (10)  being provided with an aperture (12) through which the  guide-rod (7) extends with play therebetween when the lever  (10), against the force exerted by the spring (15) and in cooperation  with a pin (9) affixed to the device, is pulled toward  the device; while after release of the lever (10) the edges of  the aperture grip the guide-rod (7).
