<ABSTRACT>
for achieving a shut-off function, a mainstream comÂ­ municates with a control stream into which an outlet (11)  for the mainstream opens laterally.  by reciprocating the  control stream back and forth across the outlet (11), for  example by alternate pressurisation of reservoirs (18, 19)  to which the control stream is connected at its ends, access  of the mainstream to the outlet (11) is inhibited.  when the  reciprocation is discontinued full flow of the mainstream  to or through the outlet (11) can take place.
