<ABSTRACT>
an improved process for the production of vanadium  chlorides is provided wherein vanadium oxide is reacted  with chlorine and reactant carbon to produce substantially  pure vanadium chlorides and an effluent stream containing  vanadium chlorides and unreacted chlorine and the effluent  stream is contacted with adsorptive carbon to adsorb the  vanadium chlorides and chlorine in the effluent and the  adsorptive carbon containing the adsorbed vanadium chlorides  and chlorine is recycled as reactant carbon.  in the process vanadium oxide and chlorine are fed to a  reactor (22) containing reactant carbon in fluidized form.  the  reaction mixture is fed via a cyclone (34) first to a condensers  (36) and (40).  the gaseous material from condenser (40)  forms a part of an effluent stream (66).  the effluent stream  (66) is passed through an adsorber (68) containing adsorptive  carbon.  the adsorptive carbon having adsorbed therein  vanadium chlorides and chlorine is passed to a storage area  (78) where it is mixed with make up reactant carbon and  recycled as reactant carbon.
