<ABSTRACT>
a process is provided for making a relief printing form  which is at least partially cylindrical from a liquid photo足 polymerizable molding (19) material.  in accordance with the  process, a molding material (19) is spread over the internal  surface of the cylindrical wall (2) by centrifugal force and  hardened in the desired places with ultraviolet light (9) to form  an image corresponding to a printing design.  the nonhar足 dened portions of the molding material are then removed.   the cylindrical wall (2) is a transparent cylindrical tube (2).  an  exchangeable image-bearing film (17) is placed on the inside  of the tube.  photopolymerizing radiation of the printing form material  is effected during rotation of the transparent cylindrical tube.   an exchangeable image-bearing film (17) is placed on the  inside of the tube.  photopolymerizing radiation of the printing  form material is effected during rotation of the transparent  cylinder by means of one or more radiation sources (9) distri足 buted around the circumference of the transparent cylinder.   the rays act on the molding material via the wall of the trans足 parent cylinder and the image-bearing film.  the radiation for  hardening the printing form takes place in a continuous  operation following the application of the molding material to  the cylindrical wall by centrifugal force.
