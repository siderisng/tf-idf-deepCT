<ABSTRACT>
a loader (10) for a gear burnishing machine includes a  gear carrier (144) and a guide embodied by a rack (122) for  cooperating to move a gear to be burnished into meshing  relationship with a gear rack of the burnishing machine.  a  hopper (22) including a feed mechanism provides feeding of  the gears to the carrier (144).  carrier movement moves the  gears from the hopper to the machine as the guide rack (122)  aligns the gear teeth for meshing with the gear rack teeth.  a  retaining shaft of the carrier (144) captures the gears between  spaced retainers of the carrier (144) as the gears move to the  machine for burnishing.  a retaining member (66) and a mov­ able dog (84) of the feed mechanism cooperate in feeding  gears to the carrier (144).  after burnishing, an actuator includ­ ing a pusher (204) moves the burnished gear off the guide  (122) to a delivery unit (14) including an inclined ramp (198).
