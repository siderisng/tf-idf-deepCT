<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to flash dressing compositions for  use in foundries comprising a mixture of diacetone alcohol  and a c₁-c₄ monohydric alcohol.  these mixtures have a flash  point above 90°f which meets the safety requirements  against fire hazards.  in spite of this they are not difficult to  ignite or burn-off completely from the castings on which they  are applied.  they are also less expensive than dressings  commercially available hitherto.
