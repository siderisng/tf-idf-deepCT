<ABSTRACT>
insecticidal phosphoramidothioates.  compounds of  formula (i)    wherein r₁ is an alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon  atoms and r₂ is an aikyl group having from 2 to 8 carbon  atoms are prepared by reacting methamidophos with  appropriately substituted n-chlorosulfenyl carbamates, pre­ ferably in the presence of an hcl acceptor.  compounds of  formula (i), especially those having r₂ as an isopropyl or a  tert. -butyl group are useful as insecticides which have high  insecticidal activity but low mammalian toxicity for greater  mammalian safety.  in addition, once sprayed on crops, the  compounds of formula (i) are not readily removed therefrom  by rain and moisture.
