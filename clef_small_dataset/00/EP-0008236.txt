<ABSTRACT>
a process for forming tin oxide semiconductive hetero­ junction devices, for example solar cells, comprises pro­ viding and n-type silicon substrate (4), preferably having  a resistivity less than 10 ohm-cm; forming an insulating  layer (3) on at least part of the surface of said silicon sub­ strate, said insulating layer being sio₂, si₃n₄, geo₂, al₂o₃  or tio₂; heating said substrate to provide a substrate sur­ face temperature in the range of 300°c to 400°c, preferably  330 to 360°c; and contacting said heated substrate in the  presence of air with an atomized liquid solution of tin tetra­ chloride and an organic ester having a boiling point below  about 250°c while continuing said heating, said contact­ ing being for a time at least sufficient to deposit a conduc­ tive coating of tin oxide (2) on the insulating layer on the  substrate.  thereafter a first metal electrode (6) can be deposited  onto the tin oxide layer and a second metal electrode (7)  can be deposited onto a surface of the silicon substrate  either not having the tin oxide coated, or from which that  coating has first been removed.  sio₂ is the preferred in­ sulating layer material and ethyl acetate the preferred ester.   the invention enables a solar cell to be produced having  a sunlight conversion efficiency in the order of 10 to 12%.
