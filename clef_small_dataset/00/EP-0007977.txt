<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for burning pieces of burns, such as limestone, dolomite, magnesite, or the like, in a ring-shaft furnace with annular shaft and inner shaft, wherein the annular shaft and the inner bay is alternately connected with fresh air and fuel gases and connected to the exhaust gas discharge. Furthermore, the invention relates to a ring shaft furnace for carrying out this method, which has a top-open shaft insert (12), wherein the firing means selectively wise in the out-of-the shaft insert (12) assembly ring shaft (22) and in the inserts within the shaft insert (12) formed inner shaft (20) is entered. In a first operating state, the inner shaft (20) is connected to the exhaust gas discharge near its upper end, with fuel gas and combustion air in the annular shaft (22). In a second operating state, the inner shaft (20) is supplied with combustion air and fuel gas, while the annular shaft (22) is connected near its upper end with the exhaust gas discharge, so that in the first operator state of the annular shaft (22) in the same and The inner shaft (20) in the countercurrent and in the second operation state of the annular shaft (22) in the counter- and in the inside shaft (20) in the direct current from the air or flows through the gas. fig. 1 shows an annular shaft furnace according to the invention in the longitudinal section through a first plane containing the longitudinal axis of the furnace in a first operating position.
