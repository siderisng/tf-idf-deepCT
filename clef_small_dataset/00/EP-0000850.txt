<ABSTRACT>
1.  an effort multiplying mechanism, of the type comprising a driving means movable along an axis and having a driving surface which makes a relatively small angle with this axis, a fixed bearing surface making a relatively large angle with this axis, a driven means movable along said axis and having an engaging surface perpendicular to this axis, and rolling means capable of coming into contact simultaneously with these three surfaces, characterized in that each rolling means comprises three independent rolling elements (7-8-9, 107-108-109) which are freely rotatable about the same axis (y-y), each of these elements being capable of rolling on only one of the three surfaces (2-3-5, 2**c -50-5**a ).
