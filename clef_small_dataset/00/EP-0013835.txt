<ABSTRACT>
a control circuit for firing an electrically actuable igniter  (11) in response to a firing signal having predetermined cha­ racteristics.  for protection from inadvertent or accidental ac­ tuation, the control circuit includes at least one inductor in se­ ries (14) with the fuse wire of the igniter and at least one induc­ tor in parallel (16) with the source of the firing signal.  the series  and parallel inductors are electromagnetically coupled to one  another through a ferrite bead (20) and are electrically con­ nected so as to generate opposed magnetic effects when cur­ rent flows through them.  electric detonators incorporating the  control circuit are also detailed.
