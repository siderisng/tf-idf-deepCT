<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for detecting a projectile, and for determin­ ing the position at which the projectile impinges on a target  comprises a framework covered with sheets of material capa­ ble of being penetrated by a projectile to form an anechoic  chamber, and transducers (56, 58, 60) located within the  chamber on an arc of a circle to detect pressure or shock  waves within the chamber generated by the projectile, and  means (76) to measure the time differences between the in­ stants of reception of the pressure or shock waves by the  transducers, and means (80) for calculating the position of  the projectile.
