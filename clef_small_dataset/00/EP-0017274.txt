<ABSTRACT>
Manure, previously finely ground, is diluted (3) so as to form a liquid mixture containing at most 4% solids. This mixture is introduced into a bioreactor (6) whose gas is used to power the burner (11) of a dryer (10) in which the manure particles are dried. Before and after passage of the mixture into the bioreactor, filaments and fibers are separated (4, 9). An at least part of the liquid separated in the second separator (9) is recycled (13) in the initial liquid mixture. The energy of the drying water vapor is used to activate the bioreaction (16). The non-recycled residual liquid is subjected to nitrification / denitrifica treatment (15). The residual sludge can be recovered (23) and mixed with the dried product, as well as the fibers and filaments eliminated. Sludge, filaments and fibers, rich in protein, can be used directly as a feed for livestock. Other residual products can be used as fertilizer.
