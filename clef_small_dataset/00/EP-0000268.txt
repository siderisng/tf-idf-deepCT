<ABSTRACT>
method for thermally toughening glass sheets and glass  sheets obtained by this method, in particular to be used as  motor vehicle side or rear windows.  a method of thermally toughening glass sheets for use  as motor vehicle side or rear windows so that the glass  sheets produced conform to regulations specifying fracture  requirements.  the glass sheets are advanced through a quenching station  for gas quenching.  the advance of the glass sheet relative  to the flow of quenching gas is terminated for a predetermined  time whereby localised gas flows are applied to  the glass sheet.  the method induces in the glass sheet a  distribution of regions of more highly toughened glass  interspersed with regions of lesser toughened glass.
