<ABSTRACT>
Control device for a dental device which can be adjusted to or from the parts thereof in a plurality of positions, using actual and setpoints to form electrical signals which embody the actual value of the object to be adjusted, wherein for the object to be adjusted Several the adjustable positions embody setpoint generator are present. According to the invention, the actual value of the object to be adjusted is formed by a clock (20) coupled to the associated drive motor (7), which outputs pulses taken from a count member (21) and added or subtracted depending on the direction of rotation of the drive motor. As a setpoint generator electronic locale memory (23) are provided. Further, a comparator (24) connected on the one hand with the output of the count member (21) and on the other, on the other hand, which compares the counter reading of the count member (21) with that of the retaining memory (23), such that the drive motor ( 7) via a switching amplifier (26) in the presence of a difference depending on the sign of the difference in one or the other direction of rotation is turned on and switched off at the same count.
