<ABSTRACT>
n-sulfinyl carbamates having the general formula    are novel compounds.  they are useful as pesticides, particu­ larly insecticides, and are applied to crops and other loci  where pests are to be killed.  pesticidal compositions contain  such compounds.  the compounds are produced by reacting a  carbamate of the formula    with an equimolar amount or molar excess of thionyl chloride  to produce a compound of formula r²-o-co-nr³-socl, which  constitutes another embodiment of the present invention,  and reacting the latter with a suitable nucleophilic reactant.  in  the formula r² is one of certain hydrocarbon and substituted  hydrocarbon and imino groups, r³ is c₁₋₄ alkyl, phenyl or one  of certain substituted phenyl groups, and r¹ is the residue of  certain nucleophilic reactants.  the pesticidal compounds of the present invention retain  the insecticidal activity of the carbamates from which they are  derived but are lower in mammalian toxicity.
