<ABSTRACT>
in an input scanner, the subject to be scanned (22) is  translated in a cross scan direction relative to a two di­ mensional, integrated ccd detector array (23) or the like  so that successive full scan length segments of the subject  (22) are sequentially imaged onto the array (23).  the pho­ tosensitive zones of the detectors (25) within the different  rows of the array (23) are laterally staggered so that each  of the detectors (25) responds to a specific spatially prede­ termined resolution element or pixel of each scan line.  the  detectors generate data samples in response to those pix­ els but the data samples representing adjacent pixels of  any given scan line are distributed over multiple rows of  the array (23) in accordance with a two dimensional distri­ bution function which depends on the staggering of the  photosensitive zones of the detectors.  ii multiple scan lines  are, simultaneously imaged onto the array, buffered destag­ gering electronics, operating in accordance with the inver­ se of that distribution function, may be utilized to arrange  the data samples representing adjacent pixels in a serial  video data stream having a conventional raster scan for­ mat.  if, however, only one scan line is imaged onto the ar­ ray (23) per imaging frame, the data samples may be di­ rectly read out of the detectors in a scan line-by-scan line  serial video data stream.
