<ABSTRACT>
a method of making high density powdered metal com­ pacts and also a method for making high density powder  metal sintered products is disclosed.  with respect to the com­ pacts, iron powder of coarse or fine configuration is mixed or  coated with a low-melting metal additive selected from the  group consisting of tin, copper-tin, copper-lead, or lead in a  percentage by weight of 2-5% of the admixture.  the admix­ ture is subjected simultaneously to both heat (at a tempera­ ture level such that the low-melting alloy is in a liquid phase)  and pressure which is in the range of 10-30 tsi.  upon relief of  heat and pressure, the agglomerated or compacted product  will possess an increased density in excess of 80% and an  improved hardness and strength level.  with respect to a sintered product, the powder metal is  selected to have a fine particle size (average range of about 4-5  microns) and the powder is dry impact coated by ball milling  with a low-melting additive such as tin, copper-tin, copper-­ lead or lead; the coated particles are warm briquetted and  subjected to a sintering operaton whereby the resulting pro­ duct has a minimum density of 97% or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
cription this invention relates to a method of making powder compacts. powdered metal compacts have been used in some industrial applications, but have not generally found fuli acceptance because the extra method steps and the added cost required to obtain a reasonable strength level and density in the powdered metal compact have been excessive, particularly when compared to similar parts obtained by melt formation. the conventional commercial mode of processing powdered metal to form compacts typically comprise (a) blending and milling together selected powder elements in the presence of a lubricant, (b) compacting the mechanicall i blended charge (c) heating the compact under a reduncing atmosphere for a period of 30 min. at 810 c to volatilize the lubricant, and (d) sintering the compact at an appropriate temperature. this has resulted at best in a green density prior to sintering of about 79-86% and a sintered density of 80-89% of theoretical. a higher density level would require additional hot forging to increase the strength level any reduce porosity. in order to increase the strength ana density of the parts without seconåary corsole-ation (hot forging), it bas been proposed to effect cold briquetting or celd compacting with a low melting matrix element effective to close pores; this processing is then followed by conventional sintering (u.s. patents nos. 1,922,548 and 1,793,757 disclose such proposals). another method is to raise the temperature of the blended powders to a liquid-solid condition and then sinter such powders in such multiphase condition while under pressure. this is exemplified in u.s. patent 3,393,630. rnhe principal difficulty that is experi enced ':it} coll briquetting is th'.t it promotes a negative effect on density even when low melting filler agents are employed. the principal difficulty of sintering under pressure while in the liquide-solid condition without any pre-compaction is that the equipment is severely pressed and subjected to considerable wear resulting in increased cost of processing. according to the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a metal powder compact which comprises compacting metal powder in the presence of from 1 to 5% by weight of a low-melting point metal at a temperature sufficient to melt the lovi-melting point metal. in the preferred embodiment of the invention, 1-5%, preferably 2-4g of a low melting metal ingredient (preferably selected from copper-tin, copperlead, and lead) is added to a coarse or fine iron powder and the mixture is subsequently warm- briquetted (preferably at a temperature of 450-6500f) to form a liquid phase of said addition agent while consolidating the powder. the particle size of the base iron powder is preferably relatively fine (4-5 microns) and about 2.5% of a liquid phase promoting ingredient, particularly tin, is preferably added thereto, the blended mixture has warm briquetted at a temperature of from 450 to 650 f. the compact may then be sintered. desirably a cryogenically-produced fine powder is used as the source of the powdered metal. the present invention includes two preferred embodiments:- (i) the addition of 1-5% of a low-melting metal,
