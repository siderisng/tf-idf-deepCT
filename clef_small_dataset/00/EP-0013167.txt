<ABSTRACT>
in the production of solid films (e. g.  a floor covering wear  layer) by casting, fusing and then cooling a vinyl chloride  polymar plastisol, good physical properties of the plastisol  and films are provided by use of a prime plasticizing ester  containing at least 40% by weight of diester selected from  alkyl benzyl succinates, glutarates and mixtures thereof.  the  amount of prime plasticizing ester used is less than the 35 phr  generally regarded as the minimum for satisfactory plastisol  formation and/or film plasticization, and by using such small  amounts of ester, the films have unusually high stain resisÂ­ tance.
