<ABSTRACT>
a wind machine has a tower frame (12) formed by  four converging beams.  at the top of the tower is a gear  head (26) connected to a wind driven rotatable multibladed  rotor (48).  connected to the gear head is a vertical shaft  (27) which is reciprocated vertically as the rotor rotates.   bearings (22, 30) above and below the gear head enable  the gear head to drive the shaft in both pushing and pull­ ing modes.  the system includes a counterbalance assem­ bly (50) having tubular arms (52) at opposite sides of the  vertical shaft.  the arms are slidably carried by sleeves (60)  pivoting in vertical planes on stationary pillow blocks (56)  secured to the tower frame.  inner ends of the arms are con­ nected to the vertical shaft.  weights inside the arms are  adjustably positioned on threaded rods, and both rods and  weights can be locked in place for adjusting the counter­ balancing effect of the assembly with respect to the verti­ cal shaft and load.
