<ABSTRACT>
a direct current detecting device is disclosed in which  two pairs of saturable cores (11, 12; 13, 14) are provided  so as to enclose a conductor (21) carrying a direct current  to be measured.  on each core, a bias winding (51-54), a  feedback winding (41-44) and an output winding (31-34)  are wound.  first and second output circuits (1, 2) are pro­ vided, each connected with one pair of output windings  and including two closed current paths each consisting of  one of the output windings, a common load (63; 64), a  common a. c.  supply source (61; 62) and a diode (75, 76;  77, 78).  these diodes function to allow the greater one of  current flows of the two closed paths to be passed through  the common load, in order to give an output signal in  which slits or notches are reduced.  an amplifier (100) is  connected to receive the difference between output signals  of the two output circuits and to supply its output to the  feedback winding, whereby the magnitude of the feedback  current becomes a function of the magnitude of the cur­ rent flowing through the conductor and can be measured  by an indicator 102.
