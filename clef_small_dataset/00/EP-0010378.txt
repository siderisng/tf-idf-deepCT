<ABSTRACT>
a viscous fan clutch is typically employed in a fan drive  mechanism within a truck or automobile.  a shaft (12), driven  by the engine, rotates a clutch member (24) within the fan  drive.  the clutch member is arranged for fluid engagement  with a body member (38) for the transmission of torque  thereto when fluid is disposed in an operating chamber  defined by complimentary shear surfaces (30,64) in the clutch  and body members.  during relative rotation between the two  members, fluid is pumped through a return passage (76,78) to  a valve (97) coaxially disposed with the driven shaft which  selectively directs a flow of viscous fluid alternately to a stor­ age chamber (73) or directly back into the operating chamber.   the valve is biased into a first position in which the fluid is  directed into the fluid storage chamber and is actuated into  the second position by means of a coaxially disposed sol­ enoid (120) acting upon ferrous metal members of the valve.   when the valve is in the second position, a port is opened for  fluid communication between the fluid storage chamber and  the operating chamber.
