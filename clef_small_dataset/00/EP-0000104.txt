<ABSTRACT>
an optically achromatized acoustooptic deflection  apparatus.  acoustooptic deflectors scan light through a scan angle  which is a direct function of wavelength.  in multicolor systems,  the scan angles must be equalized.  according to the invention, equalization is accomplished  by one prism (26) or more prisms which magnify  the scan angles by an amount which is an inverse function of  the specific wavelengths involved.  at least two beams are  passed through the same prism so that the beams do not  have to be separated to equalize the scan angles.  the prism  can also provide separation of the beams for insertion of  optical elements in separate beams.
