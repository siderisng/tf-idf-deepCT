<ABSTRACT>
in making a magnetic transducer head with both read and  write transducers a problem occurs as the transducers must  be accurately aligned but are separated by an insulating layer.   a method of making a read/write transducer head is dis­ closed which has separate read (16) and write (18) transducers  comprises the steps of depositing a sequence of layers (32r,  34r, 20r, 40r, 38r) upon a substrate (10) to form read trans­ ducer (16); depositing a transparent insulating layer (44) with  surface l upon read transducer (16) and lapping the layer flat  to surface (s); depositing a sequence of layers (32w, 34w,  20w, 40w, 38w) upon insulating layer (44, s) to form write  transducer (18), using optical alignment via transparent layer  (44) to align the write transducer (18) relative to the read  transducer (16); and finally depositing a protective insulating  layer (46,l2) upon the write transducer (18).  the substrate (10)  may be formed as a slide with an air bearing surface for flying  relative to a rotary magnetic disk.
