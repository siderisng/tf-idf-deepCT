<ABSTRACT>
in a package strapping tool of the pusher bar type a strap  foot restrainer 59 pivoted at 49 to a frame 25 carrying a strap  foot 47 is swung clockwise by double-acting auxiliary piston  and cylinder assembly 63 from an open position, allowing  strapping to be inserted laterally between a rotary dog 50  and strap foot 47, to a closed position in which a  part 60 of the restrainer 59 engages the underside 61 of the  strap foot 47 to support the strap foot 47 against the pressure  of the rotary dog 50.  in the closed position the restrainer 59  bears against a peg 68 on a carrier, also pivoted at 49 the  frame 25, for the rotary dog 50 driven by an air motor 51 and  urges the dog 50 against strapping overlying the strap foot  47.  the cylinder 65 of the auxiliary piston and cylinder  assembly 63 is rigid with the jointing mechanism 22, 27  pivoted to the frame at 45 and the action of the auxiliary  piston and cylinder assembly in closing the restrainer also  closes the strap foot 47 against a back plate 37 of the jointing  mechanism.  a tapering toe 48 of the strap foot 47 is thus  forced into the angle between the loop of strapping and  spare strapping used for tensioning the loop by the dog 50  and finally cut off against the toe 48.  in the opposite direction  the auxiliary piston and cylinder assembly 63 opens the  restrainer 57 and moves the strap foot 47 away from the  jointing mechanism.
