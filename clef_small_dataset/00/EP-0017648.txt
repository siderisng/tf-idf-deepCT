<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for internal enemy of hollow vessels which are hanging on an endless orbit through the device in which the hollow vessel (7) can be connected to a bottom opening to a pipe socket (5) equipped with a valve (4), which in a reservoir (1) with email latch (2) dives. With an upper opening, the hollow vessel (7) connects to a line (10) leading to a vacuum pump (16). As soon as the hollow vessel (7) was connected to the pipe socket (5) and the line (10), the valve (4) is closed for the time being, whereupon the air is sucked out of the storage table, whereby the pores on the inner wall of the hollow vessel (7) be vented. Here, the valve (4) is opened with a permanent suction effect of the line (10) so that the slurry pours into the hollow chamber (7) and the bolted pores completely canceled. This creates a superstructure, which results after firing a particularly resistant email glass.
