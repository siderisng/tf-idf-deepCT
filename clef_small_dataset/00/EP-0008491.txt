<ABSTRACT>
a digital demodulator for differential phase shift keyed  (dpsk) signals (154) includes two pairs of 1-bit integrators  (105, 106 and 107, 108) for continuously taking the phase  difference between successive dpsk bits.  each dpsk bit is  subdivided (100) into a plurality of bits, for example 15 bits.  a  weighted output signal having 4 bits is provided by each 1-bit  integrator for each of the bits corresponding to a dpsk bit.   the weighted output signals from each pair of 1-bit integ­ rators are sine weighted and multiplied (118).  the products  are then added (120) together for application to a comparator  (121).  the comparator (121) compares the sum of the addition  to a predetermined reference signal and provides a demod­ ulated digital signal (155) having a logical state dependent on  whether the sum is greater or smaller than the predetermined  reference.
