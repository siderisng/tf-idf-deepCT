<ABSTRACT>
a machine and a process for manufacturing plastic  bottles by fitting round-bottomed hollow bodies (27) of  plastic material to flat-bottomed base cups (28) of similar  material comprises a turntable (4) forming a multiplicity of  peripherally equispaced seats (21) at a lower level and a like  number of outwardly open radial pockets (17) at an upper  level.  the hollow bodies (27) are entrained on the turntable  (4) by a conveyor (3) from a blow-molding unit, generally  tangentially between the two levels.  the separately produced  base cups (28) are successively deposited on seats  (21) of the turntable (4).  the hollow bodies (27), introduced  by the conveyor (3) into respective pockets (17), then  descend onto the underlying base cups (28) which are coated  with a bonding agent.  the body (27) and its base cup (28) are  held in firm contact over a fractional revolution of the  turntable (4); the resulting bottles are extracted further  downstream by a stationary unloader (32).
