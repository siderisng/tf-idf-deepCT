<ABSTRACT>
a brush electrode for use in electrotreating a metal  surface, comprises an electrode (2) covered by an absorbent  abrasive material (4) formed of synthetic fibres.  a  preferred abrasive material is a mixed polypropylene/  nylon felt in which the fibres are consolidated by needle-punching  and bonded with acrylic resin.  the invention  includes a method of depositing a metal or an alloy on  to a metal body using the brush electrode, which allows  good quality deposits to be obtained without the need to  transport the metal body to a factory for the treatment.   a solution for use in the method, which is especially  stable under such conditions, includes metal ions which  will form an alloy, a hydroxy-carboxylic acid such as a  gluconate or heptonate to complex metal ions, and a  carboxylic acid such as acetic acid also to complex metal  ions.  best results are obtained when the ph of the solution  is between 0. 5 and 2.
