<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle-like two-wheeler has a frame consisting of four articulated parts (26, 30, 32, 34). The upper frame part (26) carries a saddle (18), the front frame part (30) a handlebar (16) and over a front wheel fork (14) the front wheel (10). The lower frame member (34) forms a rocker mounted on the rear wheel axis (40) which carries a conventional chain drive whose driving sprocket (20) via a rotatably connected crank (48) and a connecting rod (52) with the upper frame member (26) connected is. At the lower or front frame part, feet supports (60) are attached. The drive is carried out by weight shift of the driver alternately on the saddle and the footrests as well as supportively alternating by thrust or train on the handlebar. Between the driven sprocket (40) and the rear hub (72) can optionally be provided a rotation-resistant drive connection or a freewheel, which is optionally bridged by a slip clutch or a releasable coupling or alternatively in combination with the connecting ramps (90, 92) application find which overcome the dead positions of the connecting rod.
