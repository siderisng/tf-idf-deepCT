<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method of producing thermal energy for heating purposes by the combination of a heat engine with a heat pump.  according to the invention, the compressor of the heat pump is driven directly by a back-pressure steam turbine or a steam engine.  the heat pump pumps heat from an external heat source at low temperature into the heating circuit, then the heat energy of the back-pressure steam is also transferred into the heating circuit via heat exchangers.  the method is independent of the type of fuel, but advantageously low-value fuels are used; it makes it possible to produce heat energy for heating purposes in an economical, environment-friendly and fuel-saving manner.  using the method, an overall degree of efficiency which is clearly above 100% is achieved, even in unfavourable conditions.  the method can be used with very large capacities.  <image>
