<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides an ironing die (10) for use with a  punch to reduce the wall thickness of the sidewall of the metal  cup which includes a body which has a circular opening (28)  therein extending from the leading surface (32) to a trailing  surface (34) that are parallel to each other and the opening (28)  has a land (30) spaced from both surfaces (32,34) which  defines a minimum diameter for the opening (28).  the open­ ing (28) also has a cylindrical portion (38) between the land  (30) and the trailing surface (34) which has a diameter slightly  larger than the minimum diameter to guide the cup after the  free edge moves past the land (30).  the opening (28) is prefer­ ably also flared outwardly between the land (30) and the  leading surfaces (32) to produce an entry portion (36) which  guides the cup to a centered position with respect to the  ironing land (30).  in one embodiment, the wall which defines  the opening (28) also has a cut out portion between the land  (30) and the cylindrical portion (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
ironing die for ironing press technical field the present invention relates generally to the manufacture of drawn and ironed containers and more particularly to an improved ironing die for reducing the sidewall thickness of a cup to produce a container that has an integral bottom wall of maximum wall thickness and a sidewall of minimum wall thickness. in the formation of a "two-piece" container it has been customary to utilize a plurality of die assemblies that cooperate with a punch for converting circular metal discs into finished containers. usually this is accomplished in two steps. a circular metal disc is originally drawn into a cup utilizing what is commonly referred to as a cupping machine. the cup is then transferred to a body maker or press wherein the cup is converted into the finished container. one type of body maker that is presently being utilized is produced-by ragsdale bros., inc. which includes a cup redraw assembly, a plurality of ironing assemblies and a stripper assembly arranged seriatim along a path for a punch. the cups for this machine are originally formed to have a diameter larger than the finished internal diameter of the container and are initially redrawn by the redraw assembly and the sidewall thereof is then reduced in thickness between the punch and the plurality of ironing assemblies. at the end of the stroke for the punch, the end wall of the container is reformed generally to a dome-shaped configuration and the upper free edge of the container is then trimmed to a predetermined height and "necked" and "flanged." one of the areas that has received a remarkable degree of attention for obtaining accurate and acceptable containers is the uniformity of the sidewall thickness throughout the entire length and diameter thereof. it will be appreciated that in forming conventional beer or beverage containers, the stroke of the punch for the press or body maker must be fairly long and has heretofore created some problems in obtaining a very uniform wall thickness for each container when operating at commercial production rates. background prior art in order to alleviate some of the problems in maintaining accurate alignment between the various ironing rings and the punch, it has been proposed to utilize floating ironing die assemblies so that the ironing die can move radially of the path in order to obtain a more uniform sidewall thickness for the finished container. an example of such an arrangement is disclosed in british patent not 724,251, published february 16, 1955, in which the die assemblies are mounted for radial movement to accommodate misalignment between the punch and the ironing rings. ironing is a carefully balanced steady state process up to the point where the edge of the cup enters the working portion of the die. most of the time, this edge is uneven, in magnitude anywhere from a few thousandths of an inch to one-fourth to one-half inch. obviously, an uneven edge will disrupt this steady state ironing process and several types of failures

<CLAIMS>
 claims:    1. an ironing die for use with a punch to reduce the wall thickness of the sidewall of a metal cup, comprising a body having a circular opening therein extending from a leading surface to a trailing surface which are substantially parallel to each other, said opening having a land spaced from said surfaces defining a minimum diameter, said opening having cylindrical portion between said land and said trailing surface having a diameter in the range of about 1.0003 to about 1.0012 times said minimum diameter to guide said cup after a free edge moves past said land.     2.   an    ironing die as defined in claim 1, in which the spacing between said land and said trailing surface is greater than the spacing between said land and said leading surface.    3. an ironing die as defined in claim 2, in which said opening is flared outwardly between said land and said leading surface to produce an increasing diameter between said land and said leading surface.    4. an ironing die as defined in claim 1, in which the wall of said opening has a cut out portion to define a recess between said land and said cylindrical portion.    5. an ironing die as defined in claim 1, in which the diameter of said cylindrical portion is in the range of about 1.003 to about 1.0010 times said minimum diameter.
