<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for burning a solid, semi-solid  and/or fluid fuel in a fluidized bed in which the fuel is passed  into the upstream end of a relatively deep (e. g.  70 cms. ) bed  (10) of particles which is fluidized by a combustion-supporting  gas supplied at such a rate that the fuel is partially burned with  the production of combustible gas phase materials above the  bed and the retention in the bed of non-gasified fuel material.   the downstream end of the deep bed communicates with a  relatively shallow (e. g.  20 cms) bed (11) of particles fluidized  by a combustion-supporting gas in an amount sufficient to  complete the combustion of non-gasified fuel material which  enters from the deep bed (10) and also sufficient to complete  the combustion of the combustible gas phase materials, produced  in the deep bed (10), in a space (25) communicating  with one or both beds (10 and 11).  solids are circulated from  the deep or the shallow bed by withdrawing particles from a  downstream end (22) of the latter.  the downstream end of the  deep bed (10) adjoining the shallow bed (11) preferably has an  upwardly sloping wall (17) to promote a particles downflow in  deep bed (10) and thereby increase the residence time of fuel  therein.  preferably, the bed particles comprise lime to fix  sulfur from the fuel as cas in deep bed (10), the sulfide being  oxidized to casoâ‚„ with no sox liberation in the shallow bed  (11).  thus the fuel is completely and efficiently burned without  producing environmental pollutants.
