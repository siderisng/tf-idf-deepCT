<ABSTRACT>
a wear-resistant alloy, which excluding impurities, has  the following composition:   (a) about 50 to 70% of cobalt, nickel and iron; (b) 27 to  35% of chromium;   (c) 5 to 15% of molybdenum and/or tungsten; (d) up to  2. 25% of carbon and/or boron; (e) 0 to 3% of silicon and/or  manganese; (f) 0 to 5% of one or more of titanium, hafnium,  zirconium, vanadium, niobium, and tantalum; (g) 0 to 5% of  copper, and (h) 0 to 2% of one or more rare earths.  the cobalt  is the range 25 to 40% and the nickel in the range 4 to 12%  there is from 0 to 7. 5% of constituents (f), (g) and (h).  the iron  is present in a quantity not exceeding 25%.  if there is 2% or  more of carbon and/or boron, there is more than 30%  chromium.  (all percentages by weight).  a welding or surfacing consumable which (ignoring the  effect of dilution by substrate) is capable of depositing such an  alloy may also be made.
