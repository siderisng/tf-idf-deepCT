<ABSTRACT>
partially pyrolyzed particles of synthetic microspherical  polymer containing at least 85% by weight carbon and having  a carbon to hydrogen atom ratio of 1. 5:1 to 20:1 are useful  adsorbents.  they may be produced by controlled thermal  degradation in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of 300 to 2800Â°c  of microspherical polymer such as an emulsion  polymer of ethylenically unsaturated monomer which emulsion  may be coagulated before pyrolysis.  the thermal degradation  takes place in the presence of a carbon-fixing moiety,  preferably sulfonate.  useful products include, besides the  particles in powder form, the particles adhered to each other  and, optionally, to partially pyrolyzed macrospherical  polymer, to form a non-spherical agglomerate.

<DESCRIPTION>
partially pyrolyzed polymer particles and processes of waging and using them this invention is concerned with partially pyrolyzed polymer particles and processes of making and using them. the invention relates to the field of carbonaceous adsorbents and their use in the removal of contaminants from liquids or gases. partially pyrolyzed, macroporous, polymer adsorbent particles derived from suspension-polymerized polymer beads containing carbon-fixing moieties are disclosed by neely in u.s. patent specification no. 4,046,990, the contents of which are hereby incorporated into this specification by reference. such macrospherical materials are referred to herein as "carbonaceous, macroporous polymer adsorbents and have shown highly useful adsorbent properties, particularly in such applications as removing impurities, e.g. sulfur compounds, monomers and other industrial contaminants or pollutants, from gases, and purifying pollutant-containing liquid streams, such as waste streams containing phenolics or blood containing barbiturates. as those particles are derived by suspension polymerization, their physical form is beads having approximately the same diameters as conventional macrospherical ion-exchange beads, that is, from about 0.05 to about 1 millimeter. adsorbents of the prior art particle size range, when used at economically attractive flow rates for large-scale treatment of gases or liquids, cause large pressure drops across packed beds of the adsorbents. the problems of pumping liquids against these large pressure drops have, in some instances, partially offset the advantages of the carbonaceous, macroporous polymer adsorbents over granular activated carbon. we have now discovered a class of partially pyrolyzed polymer particles which exhibit many of the desirable adsorbent properties of the carbonaceous, macroporous polymer particles of the neely patent specification, but which have significantly different particle sizes and therefore different physical properties. the# partially pyrolyzed polymer particles which are the subject of this invention are derived from microspheres, usually emulsion polymer particles, having a maximum particle size of about 2rm and a preferred size range of about 0.05 to about lym. in the production of the products of the invention the microspheres themselves may be pyrolyzed; an emulsion of them, usually the emulsion product of the polymerization process, maybe coagulated and the coagulum pyrolyzed; or the coagulum may be pyrolyzed and subsequently resuspended as an emulsion of microspheres. the pyrolysis occurs in the presence of a carbon-fixing moiety, this may be introduced by its presence in the monomers from which the particles are polymerized, it may be introduced by chemical reaction into the particles prior #to pyrolysis., or it may be introduced by contact with the particles during heating for pyrolysis. any of the carbon-fixing moieties described in the neely u.s. patent is suitable. large, non-spherical, highly porous particles of partially pyrolyzed polymer having excellent hydraulic properties in high-flow-rate applications are preferably prepared by coagulating an emulsion of the microsphere polymer particles, introducing a carbon-fixing moiety to the coagulum, and partially pyrolyzing the coagulum containing the carbon-fixing moiety. the polymer particles to be pyrolyzed are preferably prepared by emulsion polymerization, wherein the monomers are emulsified in an aqueous medium with the aid of a surface-active agent, and polymerization is initiated with
