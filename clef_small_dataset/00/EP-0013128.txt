<ABSTRACT>
a non-voltatile charge-coupled device comprises, bet­ ween a semiconductor substrate (1) of one conductivity type  and an insulating layer (3), a sequence of first and second  regions (2a and 2b).  each of the first regions (2a) has the same  conductivity type as the semiconductor substrate (1) and each  of the second regions (2b) has the opposite conductivity type  and acts as a charge-storage region, the first regions acting as  barrier regions isolating each storage region from the neigh­ bouring storage regions.  electrodes (4,5) are alternately con­ nected to driving connections (ø1, ø2), each electrode cover­ ing one first region and an adjacent second region.

<DESCRIPTION>
charge-coupled¯device this invention relates to a char(3c-coupled device more particularly to a charge-coupled device of nonvolatif type. a charge-coupled device (ccd) of this invention can effectively be applied to devices such as image sensors, shift registers, memories, etc.. in general, a charge-coupled device consists basically of a semiconductor substrate, an insulating layer covering the substrate, and a plurality of electrodes arranged on the insulating layer for transferring carriers, if the semiconductor substrate is of p-type material, a positive voltage on an electrode creates a depression layer and then a potential well is created near the surface of the semiconductor under the insulating layer for storing minority carriers, i.e., electrons, which represent information. (ten the positive voltage is shifted to an adjacent electrode, the stored information moves correspondingly. in the prior art, various ccd have been developed in order to improve the charge-transfer efficiency and to simplify the electrode-structure (see, for example, the article by r.h. krambeck, r.h. walden and k.a. picker, "implanted-barrier two-phase charge-coupled device", in applied physics letters, volume 19, no. 12, 1971 and the article by w.f. kosonockyland j.g. carnes, "charge-coupled digital circuits" in isscc 71/ friday, february, 1971 p.p 162 to 163). however, these ccd of the prior art have a disadvantage of volatility with respect to carriers which represent information. that is, when power applied to an electrode is turned off, the depression region and thus the potential well under the electrode in the substrate immediately vanishes and the carriers stored in the potential well are diffused through the substrate. therefore, the ccd of the prior art cannot be used as de 5 vices which require nonvolatile storage of information even when the clock pulse applied to the electrode is instantaneously stopped due to instantaneous power failure or noise. nonvolatile ccd were proposed by the applicant of 5 the present invention prior to this application. in one of the known nonvo ] atile ccd (japanese patent application no. 53-88874 filed on july 20, 1978), a plurality of storage regions are provided each of which is adjacent to one of the channel regions under the electrodes. these storage regions are diffusion regions having a conductivity opposite to that of the semiconductor substrate and are isolated from the circumferential material so as to be in a floating state. each storage region for storing one bit of information is related to an adjacent channel region for storing one bit of info mation in a one-one correspondence. with this ccd, even if a clock pulse to be applied to an electrode for transferring carriers is not applied due to instantaneous power failure or noise, the carriers being transferred through the channel region under the electrode will be stored in the adjacent storage region for a certain time determined by both the anount of the stored carriers and the leakage current. because each storage region should be provided adjacent to one of the channel regions, and each channel region, which is formed under one of the electrodes when a clock pulse
