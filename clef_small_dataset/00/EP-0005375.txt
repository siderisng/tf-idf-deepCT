<ABSTRACT>
gamma-quinacridone pigments are known and  commonly prepared from beta-dihydroquinacridones  using a mild oxidizing agent and an aqueous alkaline  reaction medium containing a polar organic solvent.  gamma-quinacridones  prepared in this way have valuable pigment  properties but for many applications their tinctorial  properties need to be improved and this conventionally is  done by means of a finishing treatment, normally involving  contact with a solvent medium or milling.  such finishing  treatments are a disadvantage in that they add to the  cost and inconvenience or production.  the invention  enables production, without carrying out finishing treatments,  of gamma-quinacridones having tinctorial properties  comparable to those obtained when a finishing  treatment is conducted, by carrying out the oxidation of  the beta-dihydroquinacridones in the presence of a nitrogenous  quinacridone compound of the formula:    wherein r₁ and r₂ are, each independently, hydrogen,  fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl or methoxy and  wherein z represents a group of one of the formulae ii and  iii below:    in which x₁ and x₂ are, each independently, hydrogen,  fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl or methoxy, and m is  an integer of from 1 to 4, said group(s) z being substituents  for hydrogen on the terminal rings of the quinacridone  nucleus.
