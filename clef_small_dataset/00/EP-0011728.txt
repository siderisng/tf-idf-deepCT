<ABSTRACT>
The centrifugal beam device for irradiating wire or rod material has two centrifugal wheels (5.6) in a closed.Housing, which drove a blasting agent and one.Exit for the tinder, wear fabrics and the same.The material to be radiated becomes between the centrifugal wheels, which are driven in the same direction of rotation, guided through the housing.The radiation portions of the two centrifugal wheels are separated in the housing by a wall (4) passing the material to be radiated.Between each centrifugal wheel and the material to be removed, a guide device (10.11) is arranged.The material is thereby blasted from both sides, and a more or less closed beam is created with tel cycle, which claims relatively little energy.Basically, only the beam material must be carried out from the outside, which wears.
