<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the electroless deposition of copper on a catalytically pretreated underlay and a plating bath.According to the invention, a mixture of an inert gas and oxygen or air is introduced into the plating bath during plating.The amounts of gases in the gas mixture are coordinated so that in the bath fluid, a content of dissolved oxygen is maintained between two and four ppm.With the method according to the invention, bubble-free coatings can be produced in each desired layer thickness and high plating speed.Another advantage is that only one bath must be used, d.H.The first bathroom with high deposition rate used in a two-stage process can come in case of omission.
