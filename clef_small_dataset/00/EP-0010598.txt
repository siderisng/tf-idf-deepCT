<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for securing, in a predetermined location  within a housing (14) of a substantially stationary safe or  the like and controlling access to the interior of, a portable  currency or document depository (10) having a slidable  door (11) that is normally locked closed.  after insertion of  the depository (10) at said location the rod (19) is withÂ­ drawn so that the arm (20) clears the abutment (21a) and  a barrier arm (18) rotated down to clock removal of the  depository and to rotate the member (20) into operative  engagement with the slot (12) of the door (11).  a key  (25) irremovably carried by said arm (18) is then insertable  to unlock the door (11).  the door (11) is now opened by  returning the rod (19).  the member (20) must be moved  the opposite way to close the door (11), and the door  must be relocked by the key (25) before the key (25) can  be withdrawn and the barrier arm (18) rotated up to permit  removal of the now relocked depository.
