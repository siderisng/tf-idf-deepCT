<ABSTRACT>
in a shoe and drum brake wherein the shoes (14, 15)  can move circumferentially of the drum between first and  second limit positions and are biased towards the first li­ mit positions, there is provided for transmitting force from  an actuator (30) to the shoes a lever (43) or hydraulic de­ vice capable of transmitting the force unequally to the  shoes.  the larger force urges the shoes towards their se­ cond limit positions whilst the smaller force urges the  shoes towards their first limit positions.  during forward ro­ tation of the drum, the shoes remain in their first limit  positions and can be applied radially to the drum by mo­ vement of the actuator.  when the drum is rotating in the  reverse direction, the larger force moves the shoes circum­ ferentially of the drum so that the actuator fails to apply  the shoes to the drum and establish a braking torque.
