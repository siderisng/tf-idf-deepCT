<ABSTRACT>
For the formation of regular loops in the storage chamber (10) of a tape cassette transport rollers (30, 31) are either eccentrically mounted or ellipitic or provided with a circumferential toothed belt changing thickness, and near the peripheral surface of the rollers are arranged in the storage chamber (10) stationary scrapers.As a result of the eccentric storage or the design of the transport rollers (30, 31), their circumference protrudes in the course of the rotation in the supply of the tape (12) into the storage chamber (10) alternately beyond the scrapers (36,37) and occurs behind the sameBack, so that the tape (12) adheres alternately to the circumference of one and the other roll (30.31) until it is detached through the scrapers (36,37) and forms a new loop.The loop length can be determined by choosing the transport roller size and eccentricity as well as the arrangement and length of the scrapers.
