<ABSTRACT>
a cover (11) for a tubular terminal (19) having an  axially extending wire receiving slot (21), which cover (11)  comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics  material with a closed end (12) and an open, terminal  receiving end, a wire receiving slot (13) terminating remote  from the closed end (12) in a transversely extending slot  (19).  a centrally located, axially extending stuffer (15)  projecting internally from the closed end (12) for engagement  with a wire (24) received in the slot (21) when the  cover (11) is applied to the terminal (19).  a pair of tool receiving  intersecting recesses (16) extend transversely of  the axis on the exterior of the closed end (12).  a lug (17)  is integrally joined to the closed end.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
terminal cover. the invention relates to a cover for a tubular terminal having an axially extending wire receiving slot. an object of the invention is to provide a cover which provides a reliable wire stuffing function. according to the invention a cover for a tubular terminal having an axially extending wire receiving slot, comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics material with a closed end and an open, terminal receiving end, a wire receiving slot extending axially along the plastics tube from the open end and terminating remote from the closed end in a transversely extending slot, a centrally located, axially extending stuffer projecting internally from the closed end for engagement with a wire received in the slot when the cover is applied to the terminal, a pair of tool receiving intersecting recesses extending transversely of the axis being formed on the exterior of the closed end. a specific example of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a perspective vitw of a cover according to the invention aligned with a single wire for application to a terminal; figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of the terminal and cover after application of the cover to the terminal; figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of the terminal and cover after insertion of two wires into the terminal; and figure 4 is a side view of a series of covers during application to a series of terminals. the cover-ll comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics material and closed at one end 12. a wire receiving slot 13 extends axially of the tube from an open terminal receiving end and terminates remote from the closed end 12 in a transversely extending slot 14. a centrally located, axially extending, stuffer 16 projects internally from the closed end to a location adjacent the slot 14. a pair of tool receiving intersecting recesses 16 extending transversely of the tube axis are formed on the exterior of the closed end and an axially extending arcuate lug 17 having the same profile as the tube is integrally formed with the closed end. a terminal 19 for use with the cover is a stamped and formed metal tube adapted at one end to be mounted in a printed circuit board 23 and having a wire receiving slot 21 extending axially between the ends and intersected by a transverse slot 22 which divides the terminal into two wire receiving sections, one on each side of the slot 22, which have substantially independent wire clamping characteristics as described in our great britain patent no. 1,463,830 (8299). in use of the cover, an insulated wire 24 is aligned with the slot 21 (figure 1) and the cover is pushed onto the terminal by a tool, such as a screwdriver having a cruciform head inserted in slots 16, so that the wire is received in slot 13, engaged by the suffer, and forced into the section of slot
