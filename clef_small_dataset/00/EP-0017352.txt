<DESCRIPTION>
chromanone derivatives, a process for their preparation and compositions containing them this invention relates to chromanone derivatives, a process for the preparation, compositions containing them. u.k. patent no. 1,357,633 discloses that compounds such as those of the formula (i): emi1.1 wherein a1 and a2 are lower alkyl groups which may be linked possess mood modifying activity. it has now been found that if the ch2ch2na1a2 moiety is replaced by a hydroxypropyl-substituted piperazine moiety then the resulting compounds possess a completely different type of activity, namely antihypertensive activity. accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of the formula (ii): emi2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts thereof wherein ar is a pyrimidyl, pyridyl or optionally sub stituted phenyl group of the sub-formula -c6h3r1r2 wherein p1 is a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a lower alkyl, lower alkoxyl, lower acyl, lower acyloxyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl group; and r2 is a hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine atom or a lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl group. within the compounds of formula (ii), there is a group of compounds of formula (iia): emi2.2 and pharmaceuticallly acceptable acid-addition salts thereof wherein arl is a pyrimidyl group. suitably in formula (iia) ar' is 2-pyrimidyl. within the compounds of ofrmula (ii), there is also a group of compounds of formula (iib): emi3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts thereof wherein ar"is a pyridyl or optionally substituted phenyl group of the sub-formula -c6h3r1r2 wherein r1 is a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a lower alkyl, lower alkoxyl, lower acyl, lower acyloxyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl group; and r2 is a hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine atom or a lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl group. when used herein the term "lower" means that the group contains not more than 3 carbon atoms. when used herein the term "acyl" means unsubstituted carboxylic acyl. suitably at'is a pyridyl group such as the 2-pyridyl group. aptly at" is an optionally substituted phenyl group. often when ar is -c6h3r1r2 the group r1 will be hydrogen. suitably in such cases r2 is ortho to the point of attachment of the phenyl ring to the piperazine. a particularly suitable value for r 1 and r2 is hydrogen and alkoxy respectively. in such cases r2 is preferably methoxy, most preferably ortho-methoxy. from the aforesaid it will be appreciated that one sub-group of compounds of interest within formula (lib) is of formula (iii): emi4.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. in formula (iii) the pyridyl group is preferably 2-pyridyl. a second sub-group of interest is of formula (iv): emi4.2 wherein r1 and r2 are as defined, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. aptly in formula (iv) r1 is hydrogen suitable and preferred examples of r2 in formula (iv) are as hereinbefore described in relation to formula (ii). one group of compounds within formula (iv) is of formula (v): emi5.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein r1 is as defined in relation to formula (ii). a particularly suitable value for r1 in relation to formula (v) is the hydrogen atom. the compounds
