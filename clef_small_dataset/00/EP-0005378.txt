<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to the chlorination of liquid  hydrocarbons, particularly paraffin hydrocarbons, in a  batch process.  the process involves reacting a hydrocarbon  charge with chlorine in a column reactor and recovering  chlorinated product when the chlorination has reached  a predetermined level.  inhibitors of chlorine free radical  formation such as oxygen are preferably stripped from the  hydrocarbon charge before it is introduced into the  reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
"chlorimation of hydrocarbons" tis invention to the chlorimation of hydrocarbons, particularly paraffin hydrocarbons. the chlorimation of paraffin hydrocarbons is generally carried out batchwise in the liquid phase in agitated reactor vessels. the reaction which is initiated by free radicals may be chemically, thermally, or photochemically catalysed. the agitation is generally mechanical, and vessels of a relatively large volume are employed. these known batch processes have a number of disadvantages including low efficiency of mass tranfer of chlorine gas into the liquid phase, and long periods of initiation of the chlorination reaction. they accordingly suffer from low throughputs per unit of reactor volume and high chlorine losses. another disadvantage is that to obtain a stable chlorinated paraffin hydrocarbon of high quality, a straigh chain paraffin feedstock of very high purity must be used. it is often difficult to obtain such a feedstock. according to the present invention there is provided a batch process for chlorinating a liquid hydrocarbon comprising reacting a charge of the hydrocarbon with chlorine in a column reactor, and discharging the chlorinated charge when a predetermined degree of chlorination has been attained. carrying out the chlorination in a column reactor produces a greatly improved mass transfer of chloring gas into a liquid phase, resulting in nearly complete reacting of the chlorine gas and highly efficient use of the reactor volume. column reactors are well-knom in the art. such reactors are vertically located and have reactor volumes wherein the highly is at least four times the longest transverse dimension. generally the diameter at such reactors are generally cylindrical. the chlorination will continue until the hydrocarbon charge has been chlorinated to a predetermined extent. the extent of chlorination will way according to the type and nature of chlorinated hydrocarbon which is desired. the chlorination procceds through free radical initiation in the conventional manner. the hydrocarbon charge may be continuously circulated through the column while chlorine gas is continuously fed thereto. preferably the charge and the chlorine gas are caused to flow countercurrently, the charge downwardly and the gas upwardly through the reactor; the charge is bled frown a low point of the reactor and recirculated to a high point of the reactor, and residual reaction cases are removed from high point of tie reactor. inhibitors of chlorine free radical fonation, e.g. oxygen, are preferably stripped from rhe hydrocarbon charge before the charge is introduced ini√≠n the column reactor. stripping n!ay be- eff".cted with hydrogen chloride g:-'s. the stripping is preferably effected with residual reaction gases which are removed from the reactor these reaction gases are typically flowed countercurrently to the chare in a second column reactor in a similar manner to the charge/chlorine gas flow described above. the use of the reaction gases for stripping has a number of advantages. first, stripping of the inhibitors is effectively achieved. second, any chlorine in the reaction gases reacts with the charge so that partial chlorination of the charge is achieved in the stripping stage. this chlori nation assists in maintaining the charge
