<ABSTRACT>
a viscous fluid coupling employing an electro magnet  (100, 32) which receives electrical pulses in response to a  signal received from a heat sensing device to operate a  valve arm (90) to seal and unseal an inlet passage (86)  fluidly communicating an operating chamber with a  storage chamber.  the operating chamber is defined by a  clutch member (44) and a housing member (58) that are  rotatably disposed relative to one another.  the storage  chamber is defined by a cover plate (74) and a valve plate  (76) and is in fluid communication with the operating  chamber via a discharge passage and the inlet passage  (86).  a pump displaces fluid from the operating chamber  through the discharge passage into the storage chamber.   the inlet passage (86) when unsealed directs fluid from  the storage chamber to the operating chamber.  the valve  arm (90) is moved in one direction in response to inducing  a magnetic field and in the other direction by a spring  when the magnetic field is not induced.  fluid is disposed  within the coupling and, when located in the operating  chamber, transmits torque from the clutch to the housing.   the magnetic field is induced and terminated by an  electrical control (108) at a controlled duty ratio dependent  upon a signal from the heat sensing device to control the  amount of fluid entering the operating chamber and thus  control the speed of the housing (58).
