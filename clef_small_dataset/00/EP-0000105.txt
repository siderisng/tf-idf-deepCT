<ABSTRACT>
a roller assembly primarily intended for chain conveyors  comprising a roller (26) journalled for rotation on a  bushing (36), the roller being sealed against ingress of foreign  matter by at least one labyrith seal, said seal comprising  a pair of overlapping rings (46,56) received in a counterbore  (42) in one end face of the roller, one ring (46) being fitted to  the bushing and the other (56) to the roller, whereby passage  of grease through the seal is restricted to a tortuous path  formed by said overlapping rings.  in use, the inner ring (46) provides an axial thrust bearing  surface (101) for the roller.  the rings are preferably  l-shaped in cross-section and are suitable for use with rollers  of metal or plastics material.
