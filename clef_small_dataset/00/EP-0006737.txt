<ABSTRACT>
a circuit breaker of the type in which a toggle is  manually erected to drive a "heart" as a unit for closing  the circuit breaker.  the "heart" includes a contact arm  (12), an actuator (14), and overcurrent releasable latch  means (16) which collectively form a normally latched unit.   under excess-current conditions, the latch means (16)  releases the actuator (14), and the contact arm (12) then  opens the circuit.  the latch means (16) includes a con­ ventional bimetal strip (32) fixed at one end to the contact  arm (12).  the bimetal strip (32) carries a pivoted latch  lever (52), and is surrounded by a core-and-armature unit  (38, 44) adjacent its secured end, for operating the latch  lever (52) in response to high overcurrents.  high magnetic  trip sensitivity is achieved in a construction wherein the  whole electromagnet (38, 44) moves bodily with the con­ tact arm (12), without resort to a current-carrying coil for  the electromagnet.
