<ABSTRACT>
A variety of packaging with a cushioning sheath is versed with so-called tearing bounds, which are attached to the wrapper and divide it by dragging the tear-off ribbon. The application of the tear-bearing to a film web for the production of the wrapper is difficult for high performance of a packaging mA dishes, since at the moment the transmission of a on tear to the film or film web this stands rest, but then must be transported further at high speed . The invention relates to a method and apparatus for carrying out the nonuniform movement (promotion) of the film web in the above sense and with the application of the tear-off to the film web. This non-uniform movement is achieved in that the impact material web (10) outside of a transmission portion (12) is guided over deflection organs, in particular deflection rollers (17,18), which are movable in such a way that at the moment of transmission of the Bändenschens At least the transmission portion (12) of which a stitching material web (10) is resting.
