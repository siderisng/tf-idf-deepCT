<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an assembly and method for  assessing a radiation-sensitive web parameter, such as the  thickness of a polymeric film, by passing a web inwardly  along a first path and withdrawing the web along a sub­ stantially parallel second path between a radiation source  (25) and detector (26) mounted on the respective limbs  (12, 13) of a stirr-up cradle (10), monitoring radiation trans­ mitted through both thicknesses of the web, and, preferably,  traversing the cradle across the web paths.  the invention  enables a constant spatial relationship to be maintained  between the source and detector, thereby improving the  accuracy of the measurement technique, and is particularly  suitable for assessment of the thickness of polymeric pack­ aging films.
