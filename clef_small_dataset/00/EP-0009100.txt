<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method for the operation of a charge transfer device (ctd).  in order to achieve the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal, the output stage (11-23) of the charge transfer device is operated with a frequency ( phi a, phi b) which is so low in relation to the ctd sync frequency that a plurality of periods of the ctd sync frequency ( phi 1- phi 4) fall within one readout period.  in this case, the quantities of charge which are fed to the output stage and which are signal-dependent are added arithmetically, while the noise components which are not correlated with one another are added geometrically, so that the signal-to-noise ratio is increased.  the range of application of the invention covers in particular ctd transverse filter circuits which are employed in the system with differing sync frequencies.  <image>
