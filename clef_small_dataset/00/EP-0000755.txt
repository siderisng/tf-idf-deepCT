<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing moldings of reinforced plastic and a device for carrying out the method. It is covered from reinforcing material (fiber strings) existing body before or after its impregnation with the plastic of a liquid which forms in situ the die or patride and remove after gelling or curing of the plastic. The device has a lines for the supply and removal of the plastic (3) container (22) for the body (1) of reinforcing material which is set under vacuum and / or overpressure. The body (1) can be used with its end faces in recesses in plates (24, 21), which are provided there with perforations (26.26 ') for supplying plastic (3) to the bodies (1). The plates (24, 25) are inserted close to the container (22). In the space between the plates (24,25) and the walls of the container (22) in which the body (1) are located, a supply line for the wrapping fluid opens.
