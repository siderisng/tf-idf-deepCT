<ABSTRACT>
a cartridge extractor, comprising a resilient ring seg­ ment (21) formed with a claw (30), is mounted without a rivet  in a recess (15) in the face of a firearm bolt (22).  the bolt  recess is formed with an arcuate clearance cut (31) and with  radius cuts (27,28) at either end of the clearance cut.  the ring  segment has its free ends bent outwardly to form detent  arms (23,24), which seat in the radius cuts to support the  claw in position to engage a cartridge case as it enters the  recess.  this entry deflects the ring segment into the clear­ ance cut.  when the claw seats in the base of the cartridge,  the ring segment is repositioned by the detent arms sliding  back into the radius cuts.  a pin (35), or other means may be  added to prevent relative rotation of the ring segment,  without interfering with its normal deflection.
