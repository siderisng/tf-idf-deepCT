<ABSTRACT>
an actuator driven by fluid pressure and which is practi­ cally usable and capable of operating linearly and rockably.   specifically, a universal actuator is disclosed, which can, with a  small number thereof simply control complicated and high lev­ el functions that cannot be carried out by the conventional sin­ gle-function actuator and which can also operate reliably, par­ ticularly as a rockable actuator, to be useful for rectilinear drive  or the like, over a length much longer than the entire length of  the actuator itself.  to this end, the invention smoothly converts  the reciprocating motion of a piston into rotary motion of a cir­ cular post member via a non-telescoping but flexible transmis­ sion element, while leading the motion cut of a housing and  connecting it to a load via a complete shaft sealing mechanism.   the fact that the flexible transmission element does not tele­ scope through the housing assures high reliability and allows it  to be applied to long rectilinear drive for construction machin­ ery, load handling machines, robot mechanisms, valve drive,  and elevators, and also to the synchronization of a purality of  loads, or sequence control.
