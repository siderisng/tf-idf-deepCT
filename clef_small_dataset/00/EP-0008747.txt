<ABSTRACT>
1.  a control element for a transportable compressed-air container for filling motor-vehicle tyres - a so-called tyre inflator-, which element comprises spring-loaded poppet valves (10 and 15), which are provided on behind the other on a common axis, for feeding comprised air from the compressed-air container into the tyre (inlet valve) and for blowing off air from the tyre into the open air (outlet valve), a pressure gauge for indicating the tyre pressure as well as a connecting line (5) passing to the tyre, the two valves and the connecting lines (8 and 5) to the pressure gauge and to the tyre being adjacent to a common chamber (central chamber) when the valves are shut and the connecting line (8) to the pressure gauge being sealed when the inlet valve (10) is opened, characterized in that the outlet valve (15) is provided within a valve tappet (13), which is loosely connected to the valve disc (9) of the inlet valve (10), and is actuatable from outside this valve tappet (13) irrespective of the position of the latter.
