<ABSTRACT>
The process is essentially characterized in that it comprises two stages of successive implantation of Ions Bo, in a typical type N silicon substrate;The first is with high dose and low energy (10¹² at 10¹⁵ AT / cm² -20 to 120 keV) and the second is low dose and high energy (10¹¹ to 10¹⁴ at / cm² - 120 to 400 keV).The preferred ratio of the doses is about 10. The resistances obtained are precise its, they actually have a small TCR (temperature coefficient) and a high breakdown voltage;They find application especially in analog circuits and visualization devices, with high integration density.
