<ABSTRACT>
in the determination of the absorption distribution in a plane of a body (4) with the aid of a compartment of radiation beams (5) from an approximately punctiform radiation source (1) and different positions of the body (4) relative to the radiation source, a single detector element (6) for all Radiation bundle (5) used. To determine the intensity profile in each measuring position, the beams (5) are modulated with time functions forming a complete, linearly independent functional system (Walsh functions). This modulation is carried out by means of a diaphragm (3), which is designed as a rotating disk having permeable and impermeable sectors (S1-S4). From the detector signals, at each change of at least one function value, a discrete signal value is removed, so that the total number of signal values ​​is equal to the number of functions of the functional system. These signal values ​​are multiplied by a back transformation matrix and the intensity profile is obtained from this. This principle is also suitable for a two-dimensional compartment of radiation bundles to determine the absorption distribution at several levels simultaneously.
