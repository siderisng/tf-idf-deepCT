<ABSTRACT>
1.  a strain relief for electric cables (2), which are guided through a substantially cylindrical bore (6) of a component (1) and are secured in this bore with the aid of a clamp screw (7), characterized in that the clamp screw (7) is formed out of preferably weak elastic synthetic material and has a central bore (6) which widens into the interior of the screw (7) at its end facing the cable (2), in that the end of the screw in the region of the central bore (6) has slots (8) in order to enable the narrowed end of the bore to spread and in that a pressure member (4) acting on the cable (2) is provided, which has a projection (5) directed towards the screw, with an end with widens in the outward direction, which is engageable into the central bore (6) of the clamp so long as the slotted region of this screw is located outside the threaded bore (9) accommodating this screw (7).
