<ABSTRACT>
an improved insecticidal particulate composition is a  free-flowing composition comprising 1-50% by weight of  methomyl impregnated in 10-98% by weight of a water-insoluble  polymer which is soluble in an organic solvent, has  an inherent viscosity of at least 0. 2 and is capable of  releasing methomyl at a rate such that said composition  exhibits an undiminished initial activity, an enhanced residual  activity and reduced phytotoxic damage to cotton  plants relative to solid methomyl.  the composition may be made by precipitating the  components from solution by comingling with a non-solvent  under conditions of high shear.
