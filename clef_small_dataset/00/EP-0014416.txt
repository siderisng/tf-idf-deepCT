<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an engine arrangement for motorcycles, a engine (4) with liquid-cooled engine block (5) and transmission housing (6) is substantially exposed symmet truth to the longitudinal center plane (16) of the motorcycle (1) angeord Net. It largely fills the room between the front and rear wheels (37 and 35). In the direction of travel, a fluid cooler (7) on the front of the engine blocks (5) are approximately vertically and transverse, a plurality of parallel cylinders (17) transverse and the crankshaft (15) longitudinal angeord Net. The gearbox housing (6) extends below and / or behind the engine block (5). for a compact engine arrangement with rationally producible overall structure including the ceiling gregate and low center of gravity, as smooth as possible flat and symmetrical appearance, low noise radiation and favorable arrangement of a compact exhaust aftertreatment device, the cylinders (17) are in a single row according to one side gerich tet, The crankshaft (15) after the other side from the longitudinal center benes (16) in parallel and each a housing cover (25 and 26) for the valve chambers (28) on the one hand and for the crank space (27) on the other hand form both symmetrical longitudinal outer limits of the engine (4 ). On the housing cover (25 and 26), a portion of an exhaust system (22) on the one hand and the cylinder crankcase (14) on the other hand, on the other hand, at a lower approximately symmetrical width discharge at the bottom. The housing cover (25 and 26) are formed for an approximately symmetrical outer appearance of the engine (4) approximately mirror. For its good air flow flow and for be nen protection against the front wheel (37) to whirling road dirt, the liquid cooler (7) connects to the upper front edge of the engine block (5) upwards and extends approximately over the full width of the engine (4). For an undisturbed flow of the liquid cooler (7), frame tubes (29) and 39) extend obliquely from the region of the upper leading edge to the control head (31) of the motorcycle (1) and the liquid cooler (7) protrudes in front of these frame tubes (29 and 30 ) On the side of them on both sides.
