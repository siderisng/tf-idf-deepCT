<ABSTRACT>
polyurethane foams are prepared by reacting an active  hydrogen-containing organic compound with an organic  polyisocyanate in the presence of a blowing agent and an  amylaceous material which has been stabilized either (a) by  treating with a stabilizing agent containing an effective  amount of an antioxidant capable of inhibiting the formation  of oxidation products in the amylaceous material upon  exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere or (b) by removing  substantially all, or at least a major portion, of the oxidizable  materials, particularly fatty acids or fats, from the amylaceous  material.
