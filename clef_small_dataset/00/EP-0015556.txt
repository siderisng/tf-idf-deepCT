<ABSTRACT>
a process for manufacturing laminar articles by formÂ­ ing heterogeneous melts of a combination of a polyolefin  and a second polymer with a alkylcarboxyl-substituted  polyolefin as a compatibilizing material.  also, the laminar  articles wherein the second polymer is a discontinuous  phase and the polyolefin is continuous.

<DESCRIPTION>
lminer articles of polyolefin and a second polymer and process for burking thsm description technical field - this invention relates to manufacture of laminar, shaped, articles of a heterogeneous blend of a polyolefin and a second polymer, incompatible with the polyolefin, and to such articles especially in the form of barriers to permeation of fluid, liquid and gaseous, materials. background art - united states patent no. 3,873,667 discloses a heat treatment process for decreasing the permeability of gases through a homogeneous composition of polyolefin and polyamide. that composition is disclosed to include an ionic hydrocarbon copolymer of ethylene and either acrylic or methacrylic acid. there is no suggestion that heterogeneous blends would exhibit improvement over homogeneous blends. united states patent no. 3,093,255 discloses compositions of polyolefin combined with polyamide. the patent clearly discloses that the polyolefin and the polyamide must be subjected to intensive mixing under high pressures and that homo- geneity is desired over heterogeneity. united states patents nos. 3,373,222; 3,373,223; and 3,373,224 all disclose homogeneous polymeric blends of polyolefin, polyamide and some dispersant material to obtain homogeneous blends exhibiting decreased permeability and improved mechanical properties as compared with blends having no dispersant. u.s. 3,373,222 discloses carboxylated polyethylene; u.s. 3,373,223 discloses a copolymer of ethylene with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid; and 3,373,224 discloses a metal ion containing copolymer of ethylene and an a,5-ethyl- enically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. all of those patents disclose the benefit of utilizing the dispersant to obtain a homogeneous blend and none suggests that heterogeneous blends would be useful. german published application no. 2,746,181 discloses that a dispersion of polyvinylchloride partially dissolved in polyvinyl alcohol can be gelled and then subjected to laminar flow by rolling,molding or extruding the gel to yield a multilayer structure of low permeability to gases. the german application discloses initial use of a homogeneous blend of the polymers and does not disclose use of either, a polyolefin as one polymer component, or a dispersant such as was required in the other, previouslyconsidered, patents. summary of the invention - according to this invention there is provided a process for manufacturing a laminar, shaped, article of polymeric material comprising the steps of establishing a melted, heterogeneous, blend of a polyolefin1 a second polymer, incompatible with the polyolefin, and an alkylcarboxyl-substituted polyolefin; and forming the melted blend by stretching a body of the melt and cooling the stretched body to below the melting point of the lowest melting polymer component. there is also provided a laminar, shaped, article comprising a combination of the polyolefin, the second polymer, and the alkylcarboxyl-substituted polyolefin wherein the polyolefin and the second polymer are present, in the article, as a multitude of thin, substantially two-dimensional, parallel and overlapping layers of material and the alkylcarboxylsubstituted polyolefin is believed to be present between the layers and adheres the layers together. description of the invention - films, filaments, sheets, containers and other shaped articles have long been made from polymeric compositions. special qualities desired for shaped articles have required special polymers
