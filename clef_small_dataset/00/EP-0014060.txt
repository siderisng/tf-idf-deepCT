<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for controlling the profile of an aperture  cut by a cutting head capable of traversing movement in  two directions at right angles to each other, e. g.  the cutt­ ing head (c) of a mining machine, wherein means is pro­ vided to control the movement of the cutting head (c) in  said two directions and including a template (21) for an in­ ternal profile (23) representing that part of the aperture to  be cut, a sensing device (35) engageable with the template  profile (23), follower means (3, 11) associated with the  cutting head (c) to cause relative movement between the  sensing device (35) and template (21) in a direction related  to movement of the cutting tool (c), movement of the sen­ sing device (35) into engagement with the profile (23) ope­ rating hydraulic sensing equipment which automa­ tically overrides the means (l, a) to controll the movement  of the cutting head (c), thereby preventing the cutting head  (c) from moving beyond the desired tunnel profile.  the hy­ draulic sensing equipment preferably comprises a  series of control valves (41, 43, 45, 47) associated with re­ spective quadrants of the profile which are connected to­ gether in such a manner as to reverse the direction of  movement of the cutting head (c) as necessary.
