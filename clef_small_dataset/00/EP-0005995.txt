<ABSTRACT>
a bottle closure comprises a valved insert comprising a  housing 11 and a valve member 17 which is initially biassed  by a spring 18 into a closed condition.  insertion of a measure  dispenser spigot moves the member 17 into an open  condition.  removal of the spigot, causes the member 17 to  move into a closed condition.  the member carries a spindle  30 which co-operates in pawl and ratchet manner with pawls  32 which prevent movement into the open condition.  this  pawl and ratchet detent is initially ineffective since the pawls  are held out of co-operation by a bush 31 which is a tight  frictional fit on the spindle and during an opening movement  is held so the spindle slides through it but on a subsequent  closing movement is held by the spindle and drawn out from  the pawls so releasing them.  thus the bottle cannot be  re-used once on a measure dispenser.  other embodiments show a valve member co-operating  with other movable parts to form a sleeve valve which is  initially locked open by a detent but closes as a result of an  initial opening movement and subsequent closing movement.  various refinements are shown.
