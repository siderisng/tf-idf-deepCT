<ABSTRACT>
a display arrangement consists of a cathode ray tube 1 in  which electrons from a flood gun 2 pass through a segmented  mesh electrode 7, different portions of which can be selec­ tively switched to enable the electrons to reach only selected  portions of a fluorescent screen 3.  as very low switching  voltages are applied to the mesh electrode 7 to control the  passage of electrons from the flood gun 2, the cathode 23 is  heated to the temperature at which electrons are emitted by  the application of relatively short high current pulses pro­ duced by a drive circuit 25.  electrons are allowed to pass  through the mesh electrode 7 only during the intervals bet­ ween these pulses.
