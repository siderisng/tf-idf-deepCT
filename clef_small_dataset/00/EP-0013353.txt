<ABSTRACT>
1.  an insulating device for housing a bunch of laminations (12) and to be covered by a ring winding, consist of two half shells insulating components (1) which are dimensionally stable, can be joined together to overlap the laminations and which are mutually similar in design and have an even number of radially protruding supporting crosspieces (2) equally spaced circumferential around the radial outer circumference, characterized in that each two supporting crosspieces (2) mutually diametrically opposed one prossessing an axially protruding tongue (3) and the other possessing an opening (4) which corresponds to the outer contour of the tongues (3), and having locking elements (10, 11) arranged both on the tongues (3) and within the openings (4) to be brought into engagement.
