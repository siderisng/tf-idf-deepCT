<ABSTRACT>
in a device for drawing the leading edge of a sheet through a sheet treatment machine, two clamping pieces (1, 2), running transversely to the draw-in direction, for the leading edge of a sheet and two gripping devices (4) acting laterally on the clamping pieces and connected to a pulling means are provided.  in order to ensure clamping of the leading edge of the sheet independently of the sheet width and to guarantee a low overall height, the clamping pieces (1, 2) consisting of pressure beams are connected to one another in articulated manner in the region of their front longitudinal edges with respect to the draw-in direction and are mounted in the gripping devices (4) so as to be displaceable in the draw-in direction.  the gripping devices (4) have a wedge-shaped gap (10), tapering counter to the draw-in direction, for receiving closing cams (7, 9) which are laterally attached to the clamping pieces (1, 2).  <image>
