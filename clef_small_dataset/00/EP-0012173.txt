<ABSTRACT>
data manipulation apparatus is described for convert­ ing raster-scanned data received from a scanner 2 at a first  picture element (pel) resolution to a second lower pel  resolution for display on a crt terminal 4.  the apparatus  includes a scale-changing means 3 which operates on re­ ceipt of the image data from the scanner 2 to perform a  scalechange operation on the pels, first in the image row  direction and then in the image column direction.  the row  scale-change operation is performed by scale-change pro­ jector 5 which functions to replace subgroups of pels in  the input image rows by single pels at its output.  the image  data emerging from projector 5, consolidated in the row  direction, is further processed by a second scale-change  projector 6 which performs the column scale-changing  operation.  again, the size of the sub-groups are determined  by the degree of compression required to convert to the  lower pel resolution.
