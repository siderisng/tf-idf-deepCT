<ABSTRACT>
a gasket (1′) of elastic material, such as rubber or similar  for use in forming a seal between respective sealing surfaces  of two members to be joined, the sealing surfaces of the  members being moved substantially parallel to each other  during installation for squeezing the gasket therebetween.   the gasket (1′) comprises in combination a major portion or  core (1, 1a, 1b) which due to the squeezing between the seal­ ing surfaces effects a packing pressure, and a relatively thin  gasket portion embracing the core so as to define a closed  jacket (2, 2a, 2b, 32) around the core, said jacket being pro­ vided with a lubricant on the inside, and so as to transfer the  movement taking place between the sealing surfaces via the  jacket by the sliding thereof along the core.  the jacket (32)  may be provided with intermediate portions (40, 40a, 40b, 40c,  40d), such as folds, undulations or corrugations which are  stretched during installation for thereby increasing the sliding  length of the jacket.
