<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a roller bearing which has a plur­ ality of rollers each in contact with a discontinuous annular  race.  the race (10), which is made of a formed up sheet metal  strip, has interfitting and interlocking circumferential ends on  its periphery.  the first interfitting end has a longitudinal cen­ trally located head (19), a neck (22), and a pair of shoulders  (20).  each shoulder (20) extends from the neck (22) to a lon­ gitudinal side of the annular race (10).  the other interfitting  end is complementarily shaped to receive the first interfitting  end.
