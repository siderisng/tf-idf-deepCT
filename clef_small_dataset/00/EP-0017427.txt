<ABSTRACT>
a time delay device is adapted to cooperate with a firing  device.  the time delay device comprises a piston (30) for  cooperating with the firing device, a spring (34) to move the  piston (30) between a first position in which the firing device  remains in a non-operating condition and a second position  in which said firing device is allowed to operate, a retractable  pin (35) to hold the piston in the first position, a reservoir (42)  of fluid adapted to be acted upon by the piston (30) and  communicating with a length of small bore or micro-bore  tubing (41) whereby upon movement of the piston (30) fluid  will be displaced from the reservoir (42) through said tubing  (41), with the rate of movement of the piston (30), and  therefore the time for the piston (30) to move from the first to  the second position under the action of said spring (34),  being dictated by the viscosity of the fluid in the reservoir  (42) and the length of the tubing (41).  a predetermined time  delay is therefore produced between actuation by retractiong  of the pin (35) and movement of the piston (30) under the  action of said spring (34) to the second position to allow  operation of the firing device.  a temperature compensating  device (52) is also disclosed.
