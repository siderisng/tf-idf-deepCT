<ABSTRACT>
1.  a household equipment comprising a casing (1) and a door (2) swivelling around an axis (15) which is fixed to the chassis, this door being drawn in permanence into its semi-open position by a return-spring (3) which is loaded in tension and one end of which is fixed to said swivelling door while the other end is fixed to one end of an element which is articulated around an axis integral with the equipment chassis, characterized in that the articulated element is a lever (6) which swivels in its central zone around the axis (13), and that it comprises a stop (14) which is integral with the chassis (1) and which creates in cooperation with the second free end of the lever (6) a limitation of its rotation and for any door (2) position between the closed and the semi-open position, a tension of the spring (3) drawing said door into said semi-open position which constitutes the equilibrium position of the door (2), the distance between the swivel axis (15) of the door (2) and that end (4) of the spring (3) which is attached to the door (2) being then the shortest distance.
