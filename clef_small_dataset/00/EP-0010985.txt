<ABSTRACT>
a trailer has a gooseneck connection for attachment to  a tractor (3), the connection comprising a neck (1) having its  forward end adapted for connection to the fifth wheel (2) of  the tractor, and two links (4,5) suspending the forward end of  a platform (6) of the trailer from the rear end of the neck (1),  each link having a pivotal connection (7, 7a 11, 14) with both  the neck and the platform and the links being spaced apart  longitudinally of the connection.  the rear link (5) is movable  to alter the inclination of the neck (1) relative to the platform  (6) and to move the neck (1) from a position in which it is  attachable to the tractor (3) to a position in which it is in  alignment with the platform (6) to form an extension thereof.   to simply achieve the desired movement of the rear link (5) it  is formed in two parts (9, 13) pivotally connected one to the  other, the pivoted connection (12) between the two parts  being movable to alter the distance between the pivotal con­ nection (11) of the upper part (9) of the rear link (5) with the  neck (1) and lower part (13) of the rear link (5) with the plat­ form (6) to thereby alter the inclination of the platform.
