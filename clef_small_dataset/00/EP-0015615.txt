</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
phenyl piperazine derivatives having antiagressive activity the invention relates to new phenyl piperazine derivatives, to the preparation of these compounds, and to compositions containing at least one of these compounds as an active substance. various phenyl piperazine derivatives having a variety of pharmacological properties are knawn. for example, united states patent specification 2,722,529 relates to compounds of formula 1 of the formula sheet, in which y is a straight or branched alkyl group having 2-6 carbon atoms and z is an acyl group, a sulphonyl group or a carbamoyl group. these compounds are said to have a strong sympatholytic activity and sometimes a hypotensive effect. furthermore, united states patent specification 2,833,770 discloses a group of compounds of the general formula 2 of the formula sheet, in which formula r is a chlorine atom or a bromine atom, r' is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and n is an integer of 2-5. of these compounds also a sympatholytic effect is known. it has now been found that phenyl piperazine derivatives of formula 3 of the formula sheet, in which r1 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an alkoxy group having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, an amino group or an ureido group, r2 isa hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1-3 carbon atoms, r3 a halogen atom or trifluoromethyl group, t ls oxygen or sulfur atom, and m is 0 or 1, and the salts thereof, have a strong antiagressive activity. when r2 represents an alkyl group, this preferably is the methyl group or ethyl group. when r3 is halogen this preferably is fluorine, chlorine or bromine. on the basis of their activity pattern and chemical accessibility and stability, the following compounds are to be preferred: 1-[2-(n-acetylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-chlorphenyl)piperazine, 1-[2-(n-acetylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine, 1- t2-(aminocarbonylamino)ethyq -4- (3-chlorophenyl)piperazine, 1-[2-(n-aminocarbonylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine, 1-[2- (n-acetyl n-methylamino) ethyl] -4- (3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine, 1-[2-(n-methoxycarbonylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine, 1-[2-(n-thioacetylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)pipe razine, 1-[2-(n-allophanonylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine, 1-[2-(n-allophanoylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)pipe razine, 1-[2-(n-acetylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)pipera zine-l-oxide, 1-[2-(n-aminocarbonylamino)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)pi perazine-l-oxide. it has surprisingly been found that this antiagressive activity of the compounds according to the invention is not associated with the sympatholytic properties described for the above-mentioned known and structurally closely related compounds, which properties are undesired for antiagressives. other side effects undesired also for use as antiagressives, for example, dopaminolytic, muscle relaxing and sedative properties are absent in the dosages in which the antiagressive effect occurs. it is extremely surprising that the compounds according to the invention show such a strong and in particular selective antiagressive activity, since structurally very closely related known compounds have quite a different pharmacological activity pattern. in the table below, the antiagressive activity of a few compounds according to the invention is compared with two compounds known from the united states patent specification 2,722,529 and with a related compound whieh falls within the scope of protection of united states patent specification 2,833,770. both the new compounds according to the invention recorded in the table and the known compounds fall under the general formula 4 of the formula sheet, in which the symbols have the meanings indicated in the table:
