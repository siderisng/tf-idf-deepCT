<ABSTRACT>
an electric machine, such as an induction motor, having  a rotor (17) and stator core (20) formed of metal strip (21)  coiled about a centrally longitudinal axis (38) extending  generally normal to the plane of the strip (21), and wherein  the strip (21) is provided with depressions (24) on longitudinÂ­ ally spaced locations along the length of the strip so as to  enable coiling of the strip about said axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
"improvements in electric techines" the present invention relates to electric machines both rotary as in the case of motors and generators, and stationary as in the case of transformers. as in the manufacture of electric motors, particularly large induction motors, the rotor for example is formed of a plurality of stacked metal discs held together in most instances by a casting. this and other known methods of manufacture contribute considerably to the cost of the article due to the waste in metal and method of assembly. an example of a conventional rotor is depicted in figure 3 of the attached drawings wherein the core of the rotor is formed of a plurality of stacked discs held together by a cast outer casing which has longitudinally extending arms which pass through the discs. there is a corresponding metal waste in the manufacture of stators. it is an object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages. there is firstly disclosed herein a core for an electric machine, said core being formed of a stacked metal strip coiled about a central longitudinal axis which extends generally normal to the plane of the strip, and wherein said strip is deformed at longitudinally spaced locations along the length of the strip so as to enable coiling of the strip about said axis. there is further disclosed herein a method of forming a core for an electric machine, said method including the steps of: (a) deforming a metal strip at longitudinally spaced locations along the strip to cause the strip to coil about a longitudinal axis generally normal to the plane of the strip; and (b) stacking the coils of the strip. in the preferred embodiment hereinafter described, the deformations are depressions formed on the radially inner edge of the strip it is an advantage of the hereinafter described embodiment that there is very little wasted metal in comparison to convention core constructions. a preferred form of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: figure 1 is a perspective view of an electric induction motor; figure 2 is a perspective schematic view of the forming of the stator and rotor which may be used in the motor of figure 1; figure 3 is a sectioned side elevation of the rotor of the conventional induction rotor; figure 4 is a plan view of a partly formed modified rotor which may be used in the machine of figure 1; figure 5 is a plan view of a further partly formed rotor which may be used in a generator; figure 6 is a schematic plan view of the simultaneous forming of a rotor and stator; figure 7 is a schematic side elevation of the forming of a conical shaped stator; and figure 8 is a plan view of the stator of figure 7. the electric machine 10 of figure 1 includes a frame 11 attached to a base 12. the frame 11 supports
