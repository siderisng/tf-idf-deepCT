<ABSTRACT>
a pin header electrical connector system.  the system comprises a pin header member (12) which  mates with an electrical connector member (14, 16) contain­ ing electrical terminals (20), and is latched in mating relation­ ship there with by latch means (48, 66, 98, 110).  the terminals  (20) have ferrules crimped to electrical conductors (18) and  receptacles mating with pins (22) on a circuit board (24), the  pins (22) extending through openings in the header member  (12).  the conductors (18) extend through a longitudinal cavity  (74) in the connector member (14, 16) and are gripped by  strain relief means (116) at an open end of the cavity (74).  tail  portions (86) of the terminals (20) extending into the cavity  (74) are accessible to an external test probe (not shown).
