<ABSTRACT>
a wire stitcher for binding sheets into sets in which cut  lengths of wire are formed into staples about an anvil 104 by a  former 105 and the formed staples are driven by a driver 106.   the wire w is gripped against the anvii 104 by the driver 106  during forming and the staple is supported with the aid of the  anvil 104 during driving.  the driver 106 has a two-stage action  in which a first stage motion operates to grip the wire w  against the anvil 104 during forming, the driver motion being  arrested during forming, and a second stage motion acts  following forming to effect driving.  the movement of driver  106 and former 105 is effected by a continuous travel of an  input lever 404.
