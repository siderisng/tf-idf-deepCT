<ABSTRACT>
high-intensity-discharge (hid) sodium lamps having a  starting aid comprising a plug-like ceramic member 36  extending through the longitudinal wall of the arc tube proxi­ mate one of the lamp electrodes 16.  the plug-like ceramic  member is fused to the alumina arc tube 12 and is electrically  conductive by virtue of having embedded therein a small  percentage of finely divided refractory metal.  at least during  lamp starting, the plug-like ceramic starting aid is electrically  connected through a resistor 44 to the opposite lamp elec­ trode and, as a result, on application of energizing potential, a  glow discharge is established between the interior surface of  the plug-like ceramic member and the proximate lamp elec­ trode to ionize the atmosphere within the arc tube to facilitate  lamp starting.
