<ABSTRACT>
a device (10) suitable for potentiometric analysis of liquid  ions, wherein a liquid transport member (36) extending bet­ ween and adjacent to two electrodes (14, 14′) comprises two  opposed surfaces spaced apart a distance to induce capillary  flow of liquid between the surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
device for determining the activity of an ionic analyte of a liquid this invention relates to a device for determining the activity of an ionic analyte in a liquid. such devices are, for example, valuable quantitative tools in the field of clinical chemistry te determine the existence and cause of certain body illnesses and abnormalities. a disposable test device has been developed for the potentiometric analysis of blood serum using two identical ion-selective electrodes (hereinafter, "ise's"). examples of such devices are disclosed in u.s. patent specification no. 4,053,381. the ise's of such a device are overlaid, or otherwise contacted, with an ion bridge that provides for ionic flow between a drop of a test liquid and a drop of a reference liquid, the bridge also having apertures allowing the drops to contact their respective electrodes. when an electrometer or potentiometer makes contact with both electrodes, a differential potential is detected that is proportional to the difference in activity, and therefore concentration, of the ion under analysis. an embodiment useful for absolute measurements is also disclosed. such a device has permitted rapid, automatic measurements of electrolytes using very small samples of serum. although such advantages have constituted marked improvements, there have remained certain aspects that are subject to further improvement. in one form of the device, the bridge between the electrodes has comprised an absorbent matrix open to the atmosphere, causing evaporation and loss of, or contamination by, analytes such as co2. in another form, the ion bridge has comprised a fibrous matrix the fibres of which are not always restricted to desired orientations. occasionally such fibres can extend out from the bridge and contact one or more underlayers of the electrode. when a portion of the liquid to be tested wets such fibres, the ise can become shorted. yet another drawback with certain materials used as an ion bridge has been their inability to transport whole blood. for example, a fibrous matrix such as paper has capillary passageways which are too tortuous for the transport of whole blood. the alternative of course is to phase-separate the serum, a time-consuming additional step. in accordance with the present invention there is provided a device for determining the activity of an ionic analyte of a liquid, said device including a pair of solid electrodes each capable of generating an electrical potential proportional to the activity of an analyte of the liquid in contact with the electrode, and flow control means for ensuring contact of the liquid with the electrode, characterized in that said flow control means includes two opposed surfaces extending from a first location adjacent one of said electrodes to a second location adjacent the other of said electrodes, said surfaces being spaced apart a distance effective to induce capillary flow of the liquid, the zone between said surfaces being in communication with the exterior of the device and with the electrode, whereby liquid in a drop applied to the exterior of the device can flow into the zone, under capillary action
