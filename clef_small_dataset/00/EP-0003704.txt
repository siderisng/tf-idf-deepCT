<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for continuously mixing pulverulent solids and liquids, in particular primarily plaster and water, in which the solid phase and the liquid phase are continuously introduced into a mixing vat at the respective rates required to obtain the desired proportions of solid and liquid in the mixture, the products contained in the vat are swirled in the vat the aid of a turbine to effect mixing, the mixture is continuously discharged, the rates of feed and of discharge are regulated to maintain constantly a certain state of filling, characterized in that the liquid is essentially introduced as a continuous film along the vertical wall of the mixer, the products are swirled inside a single vortex, the solid is introduced at the center of the vortex thus produced, and the mixture is extracted from the periphery of the bottom of the mixing vat.
