an indicator is provided which comprises a base (1) and a  probe (3) extending from the base.  the probe (3) defines at or  adjacent its end remote from the base a reference point (7)  and a contact plate (13) is provided the front face (14) of which  provides a second reference point.  display means are proÂ­ vided including light source (18), photocell (19) and grille or  grid (20) to give an indication of the distance between the first  and second reference points.  elastic means such as springs  (17) are provided between the base and the contact plate and  the elasticity of the elastic means are selected so that in use  the contact plate compresses a material, the depth of which is  to be determined, by a predetermined amount.
