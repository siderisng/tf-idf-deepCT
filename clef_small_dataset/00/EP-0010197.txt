<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to apparatus for interfacing a stor­ age memory with a central processing unit.  improved efficiency in the operation of a computer sys­ tem is achieved by interface logic that control the operating  rate of a central processing unit 14 to be compatible with the  slower operating rate of main memory 12.  microinstructions  are decoded and interlock latches are generated to provide a  main store interface holdoff signal that is applied to holdoff  latch logic.  normally, the holdoff latch logic provides load  control signals to sequence the operating cycle of the central  processing unit.  under certain identified microinstruction  conditions, an interlock latch is generated and the load control  signals are not output from the holdoff logic, thereby inhibit­ ing the sequencing operation of the central processing unit.   interlock latches that are generated includes a register-in-use  interlock and an invalid data interlock from each register that is  used to fetch data from and store data into main memory.
