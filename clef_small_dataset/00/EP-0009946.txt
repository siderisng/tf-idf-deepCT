<ABSTRACT>
off-focus radiation in an x-ray tube due to back-scattered  radiation is substantially reduced by enclosing the anode  target 28 in a metal enclosure which is maintained at the  anode potential, enclosing the cathode in an attached, insulaÂ­ tive envelope which is substantially separate from the anode  enclosure, and by providing effective heat transfer from the  anode enclosure to a cooling medium, especially at the area of  impact of back-scattered electrons with the inner walls of the  anode enclosure.

<DESCRIPTION>
n-ray tube this invention relates to x-ray tubes and more particularly to an improved rotating anode type x-ray tube. at present, the majority of x-ray tubes used in medical diagnostic work are of te rotating anode target type. their main advantage is high power capability, which allows short exposures, thus minimizing image blurring by patient tissue motion. although many improvements have been made on this tube type in the past, some of the inherent problems have not been overcome and limit the range of useful applications of the rotating anode x-ray tube. one problem is unwanted x-ray radiation emanating from areas on the rotating anode other than the focal spot area. these x-rays are generated b back-scattered electrons which are bouncing back from the point cf impact on the target, usually after losing some of their primary energy. the number of back-scattered electrons reaches 50% of the number cf primary electrons. this so-called of focus radiation leads to decrease contrast in the x-ray image. it is also an unnecessary amount of radiation dose to the paten or. e orcer of l0-25% of the useful radiation coming frcrn the focal spot generated by the prirr.ry electron beam. at the beginnin of an exposure a large camber of back-scattered electrons hit the glass envelope of the x-ray tube, until it is charged up to a revel determined by the equilibrium between back-scattered electrons, positive and negative ions, and currents leaking off through the, glass envelope. this e9ulibri.um depends on the number of gas molecules present in the tube as well as on surface cleanliness of the glass bulb and glass bulk conductivity, all of which are functions of the temperatures of the various tube parts at any one time. depending on this equilibrium, the equipotential pattern in the tube varies considerably in time as well as from tube to tube, leading to an unpredictable degree of high voltage instability in the tube, leading to an upredictable degree of high voltage instability in the tube. as a matter of fact, high voltage instability problems are a most common failure mode of x-ray tubes. .. the back-scattered electrons., as well as ionized gas molecules also deposit energy on the glass surface, which can lead to glass cracking or melting and liberation of additional gas loads trom the glass surface into the tube. this in turn causes high voltage arcing in the tube. the back-scattered electrons are also responsible for unnecessary energy deposits on the rotating anode, which is about 308 to 40% of the total energy of the primary electrons. if the secondary electrons are not allowed to fall back onto the rotating anode, more of the useful primary radiation may be generated before the target heat limits are reached. this would increase the usage factor of an x-ray tube, which would have an influence on the economy of an x-ray department in areas where hi h x-ray tube loads are desired such as for special procedures and for tomographic procedures. another problem sometimes
