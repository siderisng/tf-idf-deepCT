a gls incandescent filament lamp has a conventional  bulb 12 enclosing filament mount 7 and a lamp cap with a  metal shell 10.  current leads 8 and 9 pass through a first  moulded insulating base part 13 and their free ends lie in  grooves 18, 19.  a second moulded insulating base part 14,  which fits onto the first part, has metal contacts which  engage the free ends of the leads and are connected thereto  by conductive cement which also fastens the parts of the  base together.  in a screw-cap embodiment one lead is  connected to a metal contact in the centre of the second part  and the other lead is connected to a tag on the cap which is  clamped between the two base parts.
