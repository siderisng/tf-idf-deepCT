<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a magnetic field detector of the semiconductor field effect transistor type. This detector comprises a source region (5), two drains regions (6) separated by a region (8), the source is connected to the drains, respectively by two very narrow conductive channels (4), separated by a coupling channel (9 ), of a type of opposite conductivity. The assembly is covered by an insulating layer and a door electrode (7). Under the action of a normal magnetic field, a voltage of Lorentz is developed in the coupling channel, which modules the depletion regions in the vicinity of the channels, defining so-called vinhall conductive channels (in the figure, in L 'Absence of field applied the widths of the vinhall channels (WV) are identical), a vinhall channel being more driver than the other depending on the direction of the magnetic field, this imbalance in the currents collected by the drains can be measured in a differential amplifier . Application to the reader heads coded information on the magnetic tapes.
