<ABSTRACT>
a dielectric substrate for a thin film dot matrix thermal print  head has its working surface etched or otherwise treated to  selectively remove the dielectric material, in all areas which will  constitute electrical connectors for the resistance heater print  elements, to a depth approximately equal to the sum of the  thicknesses of all of the conductive films to be applied to the  substrate surface in those areas, following which the working  surface of the substrate is selectively coated with films of high-Â­ resistance electrically conductive material and low-resistance  conductive material, with suitable adhesion films as required, to  complete the print head.  an outer protective wear-resistant film  is also employed.  the resultant print head has its resistance  heater print elements raised at least to the same level as the  outer surtaces of the electrical connectors, and preferably  slightly higher, to provide improved performance and operating  life.
