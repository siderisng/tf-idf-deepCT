<ABSTRACT>
in a xerographic copier employing a hot roll fuser and  adapted to produce copies on various sizes of copy paper, the  rolls of the fuser must be of a length to accommodate the  largest copy sheet.  accordingly, when small sheets are employed,  the total surfaces of the rolls are not used.  the hot roll  has a surface considerably softer than the back-up roll and is,  therefore, subject to wear in use.  with copy paper of differing  dimensions, and referenced to one end of the rolls, uneven  wear is caused to the hot roll as portions of the opposite end  do not consistently contact copy sheets being fused.  this  wear is minimised by mounting the hot roll (14) in a frame  (152) which is removable from the fuser unit to permit end-to-end  reversal of the hot roll (14).
