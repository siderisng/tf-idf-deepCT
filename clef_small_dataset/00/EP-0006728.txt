<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for mixing liquids such as paints in closed  containers, includes a motor (20) coupled to drive a drive pulley  (22) to produce a constant rotational speed.  the drive pulley is  connected via an eccentric crank (31) to a shaker plate (28)  which has mounted therein a container housing (27) for a closed  container, the shaker plate being also supported from at least  two other points by similar cranks (41, 51) so as to produce a  circular oscillating motion when the drive motor is activated.
