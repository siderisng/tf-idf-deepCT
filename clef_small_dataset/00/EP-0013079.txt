<ABSTRACT>
there are provided s-phenyltris (sulfonylimino) tri- ben­ zene mono- and di-sulfonic acids and their salts which are  useful as complement inhibitors.  the novel compounds have  the general formula:    wherein each r is selected from the group consisting of hyd­ rogen and alkali metal; each r₁, r₂ and r₃ is selected from the  group consisting of hydrogen and so₃a, wherein a is selected  from the group consisting of hydrogen and a pharmaceuti­ cally acceptable salt cation; provided that at least one of the  r₁, r₂ and r₃ groups on each phenyl is so₃a; and further  provided that when r₂ is so₃a, r₁ and r₃ may not be so₃a.   e. g. , these compounds may be prepared according to the  following flowchart:    wherein r′ stands for (ch₃)₃c    o-so₂-.   these compounds find utility as complement inhibitors in  body fluids and as such may be used to ameliorate or prevent  those pathological reactions requiring the function of com­ plement and in the therapeutic treatment of warm-blooded  animals having immunologic diseases.
