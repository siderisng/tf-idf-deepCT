<ABSTRACT>
below a longitudinally and vertically movable mixing  head (14) there is a sloped portion of a conveyor (22) comprising  a pair of stationary central panels (168) and a right and left  pair of panels (188, 178).  each pair of panels is hinged together  and slide toward and away from the longitudinal axis of the  central panels.  a paper sheet (232) slides over the panels onto  a level bottom conveyor.  vertical side fences (32), whose  distance is adjustable, are adjacent the side edges of the  bottom conveyor panels.  a paper sheet (35) slides along the  inside surface of each side fence (32) at the same speed as the  bottom sheet of paper (232).  the central panels have air passages  (208) therethrough.  a blower (211) is operably connected  to the air passages (208) to blow air therethrough and  under the paper sheet to glide the paper along the sloped  conveyor.
