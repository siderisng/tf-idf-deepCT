<ABSTRACT>
a container (10) such as a bottle or tube for a fluid having  a neck (12) closed by a closure member (13), the closure  member being movable relative to the neck (12) so as to bring  into communication a channel (17) on the inside of the neck  (12) and a bore (23) through the closure member (13) whereby  relative movement of the neck (12) and closure member (13)  will alternatively seal the container or allow fluid inside the  container to pass through the bore (23).  the bore is connected  to a brush or brush holder (14) forming part of the closure  member (13) so that fluid from inside the container may be  applied to the brush.  in one embodiment, the neck (12) of the container (10)  and the brush holder portion (14) are coaxial with one another  whereas in the second embodiment the brush holder portion  is at an angle to the neck.
