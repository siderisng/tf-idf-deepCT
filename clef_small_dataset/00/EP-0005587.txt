<ABSTRACT>
conversion of raw coal to distillate liquid and gaseous  hydrocarbon products by solvent liquefaction in the presence  of molecular hydrogen employing recycle of mineral  residue is commonly performed at a higher thermal efficiency  than conversion of coal to pipeline gas in a gasification  process employing partial oxidation and methanation reactions.   the prior art has disclosed a combination coal  liquefaction-gasification process employing recycle of mineral  residue to the liquefaction zone wherein all the normally  solid dissolved coal produced in the liquefaction zone is  passed to a gasification zone for conversion to hydrogen,  where the amount of normally solid dissolved coal passed to  the gasification zone is just sufficient to enable the gasification  zone to produce the process hydrogen requirement.  an  unexpected improvement in the thermal efficiency of the  combination process is achieved by increasing the amount  of normally solid dissolved coal prepared in the liquefaction  zone (26) and passed to the gasification zone (76) to enable  the gasification zone to generate not only all of the hydrogen  required by the liquefaction zone (26) but also to produce  excess synthesis gas for use as process fuel.  the gasification  zone (76) operates with steam and oxygen injection rates  resulting in elevated temperatures in the range 2,200 to  2,600°f.  which enhance thermal efficiency by accomplishing  nearly complete oxidation of carbonaceous feed.  these high  temperatures produce a synthesis gas relatively richer in co  than h₂.  because the synthesis gas is utilized as fuel,  hydrogen can be recovered from the synthesis gas without  degrading the value of the remaining co-concentrated  stream, since the combustion heating value of a concentrated  co stream is about the same as that of an h₂-rich  synthesis gas.
