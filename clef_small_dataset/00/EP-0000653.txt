<ABSTRACT>
a motor vehicle rear view mirror has a mirror or glass  which pivots automatically from a normal position to an  antiglare position in response to headlight glare.  the glass  (8) is mounted between a front frame (6) and a back plate (4)  of a two part housing (2) and carries a magnetic member for  cooperating with a solenoid coil (16) of an electrical assembly.   the electrical assembly (12) is formed as a single unit  mounted in the back plate (4) and includes a photosensor  (14) receiving light through a partly silvered region of the  mirror glass (8).  a signal from the photosensor is amplified  by one or more transistors to energise the solenoid coil (16).   a pair of switch contacts (116) are actuated when the mirror  glass (8) changes its position to the antiglare position and are  arranged to reduce current flow in the coil to a level just  sufficient to hold the mirror glass in the antiglare position.   the rear of the mirror housing is coupled to a mounting arm  (22) by a ball (38) and socket joint (36), the socket (36) comprising  an elongate bore (42) having an inwardly tapering  section to receive balls of various diameters.  a locking  member (48) is secured in the bore in order to retain the ball  in the bore.
