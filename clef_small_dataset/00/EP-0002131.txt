<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to multi-screw extruders and  provides a self-cleaning type extruder including a cylinder  (2) and at least two screws (1,1′) therein adapted to rotate  in the same directions, said screws (1,1′) being in such a  relation that at any position in at least a part of the screws  (1,1′) which lies in the longitudinal direction of the extruder,  the contour of one screw in a cylinder cross-section  taken at right angles to the screw axes is in substantial  contact at one point with the contour in the same cross-section  of another screw intermeshing therewith; wherein  each of said screws (1,1′) has at least two screw flights  (3, 5; 3′, 5′), and the top (4,4′) of at least one of the  screw flights (3,3′) is substantially in contact with the  inner wall surface of the cylinder and the top (6,6′) of at  least one other screw flight (5,5′) has a predetermined  tip clearance (8) with respect to the inner wall surface of  the cylinder (2).
