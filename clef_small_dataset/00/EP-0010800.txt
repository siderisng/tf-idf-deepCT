<ABSTRACT>
it is possible to electrophoretically coat cathode shafts  with an emissive layer having excellent mechanical prop­ erties by means of a device which comprises an electro­ phoresis bath and a jig which can be dipped therein and in  which cathode shafts can be placed, which jig is composed  of a plate of insulation material (3) which is provided on  the two surfaces with a first (4) and a second (5) electri­ cally conductive layer, said jig having a large number of  apertures (2) in each of which a cathode shaft (6) can be  provided in a fitting manner such that each cathode shaft  electrically contacts the first electrically conductive layer  (4), and the plate is such a thickness that the side of the  shaft to be coated is located at a distance from the second  conductive layer (5), which distance is small in relation to  the thickness of the jig, which jig is provided at least with  a sealing nonelectrically conductive layer (8) on the side  of the first conductive layer.
