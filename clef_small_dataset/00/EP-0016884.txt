<ABSTRACT>
an attachable carrying handle (10) allows a person, ope­ rating one-handedly and without bending his back, easily to  engage a container (48), lift it from the floor and transport it to  another location.  the attachable carrying handle includes two  arms (12, 14) having prongs (16, 18) for engaging the contain­ er.  the two arms are secured together by a pliable hinge (30)  and means (e. g.  rubber tensioning member 38) are provided  for resiliently connecting the two arms (12, 14) in such a man­ ner that they are urged together.  the position of interaction  between such means (38) and the arms may be adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
attachable carrying handle the present invention relates to attachable carrying handles and, in particular, to carrying handles for quickly and easily engaging and transporting articles such as, boxes, sacks and the like. a number of prior art carrying handles exist. however, many of these have been designed for specific carrying functions and thus are inappropriate for carrying a wide variety of items. a review of the art discloses a handling tool, designed specifically for carrying concrete blocks, described in u.s. patent no.2,657,571, and a receptacle handle for carrying open boxes as, for example, food and vegetable boxes, discussed in u.s. patent no. 2,800,353. a further device which has only a specific application is the jar lifter described in u.s. patent no. 2,522,243. two prior art devices are designed to accept boxes of varying sizes. the first device described in u.s. patent no.1,849.364 is an adjustable hook. the hook has a telescoping body adapted to accommodate varying box sizes and two sets of prongs which are dependent on said body. the hook has several disadvantages in that (1) it requires two hands to set it in place, adjust it and tighten it about the box, (2) it requires the operator to bend down to the level of the box, and (3) it requires that the operator again uses two hands to disengage the hook from the box. another box carrier is described in u.s. patent no. 1,519,160. this carrier includes two arms secured by a hinge, each arm having a prong at one end. the other end of the arms provides a carrying handle: the hinge lines between the ends of that one arm. this box carrier has several disadvantages. principal among these is the fact that the carrier would require some practice in order to be able to deploy it about a box, especially if he were using only one hand, because gripping of the box is due to a toggle action exerted by lifting the handle. further, the handle, extending from one of the arms, is off centre from the centre of gravity of the box, which depending on the shape of the box, could make the box more difficult and awkward to carry and is placed in such a way that the user will tend to want to twist his wrist so that the thumb points inwardly or outwardly when his arm is held by his side instead of the more natural position with the thumb pointing forward. lastly, the barrel hinge which was used allows substantial side play or misalignment between the arms, which would rake it difficult to secure a box using just one hand and can entrap the users hand or finger if he is not careful. the present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above. the invention includes a handle adapted for carrying an article, which handle has first and second arms and means located at the ends thereof for engaging said article. the handle includes

claims:   1. an attachable carrying handle including a first arm having at one end means adapted for engaging an article, a second arm having at one end means adapted for engaging the article, and a hinge means linking the arms characterised in that the hinge means is a pliable hinge (30) and is secured to the other ends of the first (12) and second (14) arm; there being means (38) for resiliently connecting the first arm (12) to the second arm   (14).      2. a handle according to claim 1 wherein there is a tubular cover (36) over the pliable hinge (30) and over the   end    of the arms to which the hinge is secured.   3. a-handle according to claim 2 wherein the cover is a tube of an elastic plastics material.   4. a handle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the hinge is made of a thermoplastic material.    5. a handle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the hinge is a one-piece strap   (30).      6. a handle according to claim 4 or claim 5 wherein the hinge is made of an elastic plastics material.   7. a handle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the resilient connecting means   (38)    includes a first loop (40) disposed about thefirst arm (12) and a second loop (42) disposed about the second arm (14).   8. a handle according to claim 7 wherein the resilient connecting means (38) is made of an elastic material.   9. a handle according to claim 7 or claim 8  wherein the resilient connecting means (38) defines a figure-of-eight.   10. a handle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the first and second arms (12,14) are bowed outwardly (15,17) between their ends.
