<ABSTRACT>
an improved pouring mechanism in a container for liquids,  e. g. , a can, has an extensible pouring spout (7) in the form of a  tube which is movable in the axial direction in the orifice of a  container neck (2) or pipe stub having external threads (3) for a  screw cap (4).  the outlet of the tube (7) is provided with an  outwardly-directed abutting and sealing flange (8), and the neck  (2) on the container is provided with an inwardly-directed, annuÂ­ lar flange (6).  an inwardly-directed flange (9) on the spout (7) is  formed as a sealing lip which, when the container (1) is closed,  cooperates with a central plug (10) inside the cap (4).  said  inwardly-directed sealing lip (9) is adapted to engage with the  internal plug (10) in the cap with a press-fit sufficiently tight to  permit the pouring spout (7) to be drawn outward through the  container neck (2) when the cap (4) is unscrewed and lifted off,  until protruding catch surfaces (13) on the spout encounter the  inner face of the flange (6) in the neck.
