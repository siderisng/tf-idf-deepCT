<ABSTRACT>
1.  one-piece blank of foldable material for a crate with a rectangular or square base, consisting of a floor (1) with hinged end and side walls (2, 3) of equal height on respectively opposite sides, of which the side walls (3), at their upper longitudinal edge (4), carry a perforated panel (5) with holes (6) for the safe locating of containers or similar items, the width of which panel corresponds to half the floor width, and the outer longitudinal edge (7) of which is equipped with a hinged support stay (8), whilst the end sections of the side walls (3) form stacking supports, of which one side (9) extends into the adjacent perforated panel (5) which has a cut-out (16) in this area, whilst the second side (10) hangs on the end edge (11) of the side wall (3) or the first side (9), whereby each end edge (11a) of the two perforated panels (5) is equipped with a hinged flap (18) and the second side (10) of each stacking support comprises a locating portion (12), of which the lower support edge (13) is in approximate alignment with the lower longitudinal edge (14) of the adjacent side wall (3) and of which the upper bearing edge (15) is in approximate alignment with its upper longitudinal edge (4), characterized by the following features : a) at least one floor flap (19) punched out of the floor (1), whose heigth (h) approximately matches that of the end or side wall (2, 3) and which has a folding line (20) extending parallel to the end wall (2) and a wedge-shaped incision (21) at its opposite end, which is in alignement with the central longitudinal line (22) of the floor (1) and ends in a slot (23) whose depth (t) together with that of the incision (21) corresponds to at least the height (a) of the support stays (8) hanging on the perforated panels (5) ; b) on the cut-out (16) in the perforated panels (5), the dimension (m) on the end edge (11) - being the difference between the height of the second side (10) and the height of the end or side wall (2, 3) starting from the upper longitudinal edge (4) of the side wall (3) - corresponds to the width (b) of the second side (10) of the stacking support without the locking portion (12) c) the hinged flaps (18) on the perforated panels (5) are sticking flaps.
