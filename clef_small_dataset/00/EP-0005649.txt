<ABSTRACT>
a water-based coating composition which emits very  little pollutants on curing to a water-resistant coating  comprises a synthetic resin containing free carboxyl groups  held in solution or stable dispersion in water by an amine.   the amine is a tertiary carbinamine containing at least two  hydroxymethyl groups bonded to the carbon atom carrying  the amine group.  the coating compositions react with  formaldehyde to produce stable fluid emulsion coating  compositions having similar properties on curing.  the  coating compositions are used to coat substrates.
