<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for plunger molding are des­ cribed.  the method comprises the steps of:   a) placing a charge of thermosetting molding material (11)  in a transfer cylinder (13),   b) forcing said material, by means of a plunger acting wi­ thin the confines of said cylinder, through a runner sys­ tem (17) maintained throughout the molding process at  a temperature sufficient to keep molding material there­ in in a plasticized state, but insufficient to cause any  substantial curing thereof, and into a heated closed  mold cavity (21) maintained at a temperature sufficient­ ly high to cure said molding material, and   c) removing a molded article of cured thermosetting ma­ terial from said mold.  the apparatus consists of a transfer cylinder (13) hav­ ing at least one feed outlet (29) in the base thereof, a  plunger movable reciprocally within said cylinder, at least  one runner block (31) having a runner channel (17) there­ in, one end of said runner channel positioned to be align­ ed with a feed outlet of said cylinder, at least one sprue  bushing (19) having an oriflce (39) positioned to be aligned  with the remaining end of said runner channel (17), and at  least one heated mold cavity (21) having a gate (43) posi­ tioned to be aligned with the orifice in said sprue  bushing (19), the runner block (31) and the sprue bushing  (19) having independent temperature controlling means  therein.  the molding material within the runner system is  maintained in a plasticized, substantially uncured state, in  readiness for the next operation of the plunger to again  force material through the runner system into the mold ca­ vity, and wastage of molding material is reduced.
