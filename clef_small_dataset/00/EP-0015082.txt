<ABSTRACT>
a process for the production of prokaryotic, particularly  bacterial, single cell protein which includes a step in which  whole and/or ruptured micro-organism cells are treated with  an oxidising agent or are subjected to other oxidising means.   the oxidising agent can be added during cultivation and/or  during subsequent treatment and/or it can be added to the  product obtained.  the treatment is preferably carried out at a  ph between 7. 0 - 9. 0.  the preferred oxidising agent is hydÂ­ rogen peroxide.  the product of the process has a number of  advantages over known prokaryotic single cell protein, most  important being that its use alleviates difficulties of reduced  feed intake, reduced live weight gain, poor feed conversion  ratios and liver damage experienced when single cell protein  is fed to domestic fowls in high dietary inclusions.

<DESCRIPTION>
improved process for the production of single cell protein this invention relates to an improved process for the production of single cell protein (scp). prot einac eous materials are important dietary components for many animals. a wide variety of such materials are in use including for example fish meal, soya bean meal and materials derived from rape seeds and sunflower seeds. in the past twenty years considerable research effort has been devoted to the product ion of yeast and bacterial proteins for inclusion in animal diets. such proteins derived from micro-organisms are commonly referred to as single cell protein or scp. the inclusion of high proportions of some widely used proteinaceous materials in their diets can have adverse effects upon certain species. this is frequently ascribed to "toxic" constituents. the effect of these constituents has been recently reviewed (toxic constituents of plant foodstuffs, ed. i.e. liener, academic press, new york). liener (1969, pages 4 - 6) refers to toxic constituents as substances that produce deleterious effects when fed to men or animals. re distinguishes between chemical constituents that are lethal and those that produce an adverse physiological response. processing, or "other means of preparation have proved to be effective in destroying many toxic constituents". reference is also made to altshul a.m., (1967, science, 158, 221) that if it "were not for the fact that such oilseeds as soyabeans and cotton seed can be processed so as to inactivate their toxic constituents, these rich sources of plant protein would not occupy such a position of importance as they now cozzard in the feeding of farm animals". it is known that the feeding of single cell protein derived from prokaryotic micro-organisms, which include bacteria and blue-green algae to certain animal species, particularly domestic fowls, in high dietary inclusions cases reduced feed intake (tri), reduced live weight gain (lwg) and poor feed conversion ratios (fcr). in extreme instances this produces liver damage with organ enlargement, focal necrosistwith phogocytic and inflammstorr cell infiltration being observable on histopathological examination. this effect has been produced with prokaryotic single cell protein derived from different micro-organisms, grown on different nutrient media and in different processes and has been reported by (i) d e owen and s m a 1)bay (fd. cosmet. toxicol, 16, 633, 1978); (ii) l farstad (acta agric. scand., 27, 129, 1977) and (iii) c t whittemore, d w gilcerist - shirlaw, d 5 nclonald and a g taylor (british poultry science, 19, 283, 1978). prom experiments in which single cell protein produced by the process described in our uk specification no. 1 370 892 was included as a proteinaceous material in normal commercial diets fed to domestic fowls, we have found progressive decreases in lwg and progressive decreases in food intake. correlated with this is an increase in the incidence of observable liver damage as the percentage inclusion of prokaryotic single cell protein in the diets is increased. the experiments were carried out with diets containing 0%. 2.5%. 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and
