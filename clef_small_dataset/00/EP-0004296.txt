<ABSTRACT>
1.  a programme carrier comprising a circular disc (21, 22), a hub (23, 24; 101, 131; 170, 171) and a shaft (8; 66) associated therewith in its core part, with an at least substantially continuous arrangement, more particularly a regular arrangement, at the periphery about said shaft (8; 66), of segmental tongues (25, 26; 102 to 105, 132 to 135; 174, 175) cut more particularly in the same width from a circular annular surface (55, 58; 182, 183), said tongues being disposed in an integrally radial arrangement and having end portions, which are adjustable from a position of rest of the circular annular surface (55, 58; 182, 183) to latch into a position in which they project in the form of cams, and which, for the purposes of angle-dependent control of a functional group, are operatively connected, in at least one of these positions, to a lever (71) and/or direct actuation of a component (74) for closing a circuit, characterized in that the circular disc (21, 22) is mounted by its shaft (8) in an abutment disc (27; 110, 145) containing an edge surface (38), or in a dish-shaped abutment member (161) having inwardly projecting nose rings (162, 163), in a parallel arrangement, that each of the tongues (25, 26; 174, 175) has at its free end portion a head (28, 29; 164, 165, 176, 177, 174, 175) which, both in one operative connection position for the actuation of the lever (71) and in the position of rest, bears non-positively by a nose (37; 166, 169) with spring biassing against the edge surface (38) of the abutment disc (27) serving as abutment edge (36) or aganist one of the nose rings (162, 163), at least one of the surfaces of the head (26, 29; 164, 165) lying, together with those of all the heads (28, 29; 164, 165) bearing in the same way against the abutment disc (27) or the dish-shaped abutment member (161), in a circular annular surface (65, 65a) and/or in an outer surface (63) of a body of revolution as a sensing surface.
