<ABSTRACT>
For cost-effective and fast determination of leaks in meshed line systems (4, 5, 6), in particular public drinking water petals, are designed in the course of the lines control bodies (9-13, 18, 22), which are formed again in a procession of control, which is formed again Connected, through flow properties at the same time and in each case via a certain short time can be recorded regularly and for the entire line system simultaneously detected (eg half be hour daily), the certain time is chosen so that in it the flow properties, condition by the rule moderate recurring Recorders of the consumer, on comparatively long periods of time (eg Mo Nate) remain substantially constant, as in particular during the night times. Deviations, in particular over several consecutive measuring sections during the short times, show a leak in the respective conflict area. As a cheaper location for control bodies, they are to be regarded with a flow direction reversal (line 17) during the short time compared to the comparatively consuming time. The method is also suitable for locating already existing leaks. Based on statistically determined average water consumption values ​​at night, statistical in the control bodies (9-13, 18, 22)
