<ABSTRACT>
an optical screen (12) is provided which can be used  in conjunction with a cathode ray tube (crt) (10) to  prevent the crt display from becoming unreadable in high  ambient light conditions (such as can occur in an aircraft  cockpit).  the screen includes a series of parallel strips (13)  each of which includes a layer (18) of an electro-optical  substance such that it can be made light absorbent or  transparent by varying voltage applied to the strip.  in use (figure 1) the screen is positioned in front of  a display face (11) of a crt with the strips aligned with the  writing direction of a raster (14).  the position of the raster  controls (15, 16, 17) voltages applied to the strips to ensure  that each strip is transparent when the raster is writing  behind it.  the electro-optical substance is advantageously a  liquid crystal material.
