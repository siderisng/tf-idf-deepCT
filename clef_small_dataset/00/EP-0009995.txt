<ABSTRACT>
the flexible polyurethane foam is prepared by reacting  a polyether polyol (or a prepolymer made from such a  polyol and a polyfunctional isocyanate or isothiocyanate)  with a polyfunctional isocyanate or isothiocyanate in the  presence of a blowing agent and a gel catalyst comprising  a compound containing in chemically combined form tin,  phosphorus and a halogen chosen from chlorine, bromine  and iodine.  the said compound contains from 3 to 40% by  weight of tin, from 2 to 20% by weight of phosphorus and  from 3 to 70% by weight of the said halogen and is a  mono- or diorganotin ester of a phosphoric acid, phos­ phorous acid, phosphonic acid, phosphinic acid, thiophos­ phorous acid and phosphoryl chloride.  the foams so pro­ duced show improved thermal and oxidative stability and  resiliency.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method for preparing flexible polyurethane foam". this invention relates to the preparation of flexible polyurethane foams employing certain gel catalysts to obtain polyurethane foams having high levels of oxidative stability and resiliency relative to products obtained using conventional organotin catalysts with compounds containing phosphorus and halogen. flexible polyurethane foams are widely used in the manufacture of furniture, particularly seat cushions, and as packaging material for delicate instruments and other articles that are susceptible to damage during handling and transit. if the foam is incorporated into a piece of furniture or other durable product, the foam must withstand exposure of several years or longer to elevated temperatures, atmospheric oxygen, or both without undergoing significant degradation, resulting in a gradual loss of resiliency and structural strength which may culminate in disintegration of the foam. it is known to prepare flexible cellular polyurethanes by reacting polyols containing two or more reactive hydrogen atoms, as determined by the zerewitinoff method, with polyfunctional isocyanates in the presence of a polymerization or gel catalyst and a blowing agent such as water or a relatively low boiling fluorocarbon. a surfactant is often included in the reaction mixture together with a blowing catalyst to obtain the desired uniformly small cell size within the foam when water is used as the blowing agent. u.s. patent specification 3,620,985 discloses that organotin compounds are effective gel catalysts for cellular polyurethanes. compounds of the general formula rasnxb, wherein r is typically butyl or other alkyl radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and x is halogen or other anionic radical and a and b are integers and a + b = 4, are less than satisfactory for preparing flexible foams that are exposed to atmospheric oxygen, elevated temperatures, i.e. above about 500c, or both over extended periods of time. under these conditions the foams may lose resiliency and structural integrity, sometimes to the extent that they disintegrate when compressed. this is particularly true for those foams derived from polyols that are reaction products of propylene oxide and glycerine. these polyols may also contain end groups derived from ethylene oxide to obtain hydroxyl groups bonded to primary rather than secondary carbon atoms. high resiliency polyurethane foams derived from polyols that contain side chains obtained by the graft polymerization of acrylonitrile, styrene or other vinyl monomer onto a poly(propylene oxide) backbone are usually less susceptible to oxidative and thermal degradation. ho-+vever, in the presence of conventional organotin gel catalysts e-9-en these products undergo a significant decrease in structural strength and become brittle following prolonged exposure to oxygen and/or heat. the resistance of flexible polyurethane foams to oxidatively and thermally induced degradation can be improved by employing a phosphorus compound and a halogen compound in combination with an organotin gel catalyst. catalyst compositions of this type are disclosed in united states patent specifications 3,067,149; 4,048,100; 4,052,346 and british patent specification 1,003,201. this type of catalyst composition may be suitable for certain applications where high resiliency is not a requirement, since typical foams prepared using
