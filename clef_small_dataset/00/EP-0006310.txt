<ABSTRACT>
a computer based railway interlocking control system,  preferably of the parallel redundant type in order  to provide enhanced reliability as compared to a single  computer system.  the railway traffic control devices, e. g.   points and signals, are arranged to be controlled by signals  in one of two possible steady states, the interlocking con­ trol means (30, 31, 32,) is arranged to produce con­ trol signals in the steady state for de-energised or "safe"  device settings and in an alternating state for energised or  potentially "unsafe" settings.  the alternating control signals  (33, 34, 35 or 38) must be converted to the corresponding  steady state to operate the devices thus, the converting or  restoring circuit discriminates against dormant wrong side  failures, i. e.  "unsafe" signals to increase the inherent safety  of the system.
