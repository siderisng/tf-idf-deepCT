<ABSTRACT>
contrast enhancement filter having first and second  transparent glass substrates (16, 17) with first and second  surfaces (18, 19; 21, 22) with the first surface (18, 21) of each  facing the medium in which the filter is disposed.  a sheet-like  circular polarizer (12) is provided formed of stretched plastic  members (13) covered by layers (14) of cellulose acetate buty足 rate.  the circular polarizer is disposed between the first and  second glass substrates (16, 17) and faces the second surfaces  (19, 21) of the glass-substrates.  a dried plastisol primer layer  (26, 27) is disposed on the surface of the layers of cellulose  acetate butyrate facing the glass substrates.  first and second  layers (23, 24) of polyvinyl butyral adhesive secure the layers  of cellulose acetate butyrate carried by the circular polarizer  with the primer layers thereon to the second surfaces of the  glass substrates.  an anti-reflection coating (31) is disposed on  the first surface of the first substrate.  a method for manufacturing a contrast enhancement fil足 ter which comprises the steps of providing a sheet-like circu足 lar polarizer (12) formed of stretched plastic members (13) and  having outer layers (14) of cellulose acetate butyrate.  a thin  film (26, 27) of optical clear plastisol primer is applied on the  outer surfaces of the cellulose acetate butyrate layers of the  circular polarizer.  the primer is then dried.  a transparent  substrate (16) is provided with first and second surfaces (18,  19).  a layer (23)) of a polyvinyl butyral adhesive (23) is then  applied to the second surface (19) of the first glass substrate.   the circular polarizer with its primer layer thereon is placed on  the layer of polyvinyl butyral adhesive.  another layer (24) of  polyvinyl butyral adhesive is then placed on the other side of  the circular polarizer.  a second glass substrate (17) having  first and second surfaces (21, 22) with the second surface (22)  with the second surface (22) facing the polyvinyl butyral  adhesive is placed in the sandwich.  the various parts in the  sandwich are then secured into a temporary unitary assem足 bly.  air is evacuated from between the parts and the layers.   heat and pressure is applied to the assembly to cause the  parts to be permanently bonded into a unitary assembly.
