<ABSTRACT>
abrasive particles are made by selecting superhard core  particles from diamond, cubic boron nitride, crushed di­ amond composites and crushed cubic boron nitride compo­ sites.  the core particles are coated with a thin outer metal  layer e. g.  titanium.  then the particles are pelletized with a  hard metal powder mixture.  metal-bonded nitrides, metal-­ bonded borides, metal-bonded silicon carbides, metal-­ bonded diamond power may also be used; nitriding of the  outer layer may be obtained by sintering in a nitrogen atmo­ sphere; carbide formation could be achieved by adding gra­ phite powder to the mixture before pelletizing.  the green pel­ lets are sintered to yield abrasive pellets which may be incor­ porated in tools using a suitable bond such as a resin, metal  or vitreous bond.

<DESCRIPTION>
description coated abrasive pellets and method of making same this invention relates to coated superhard abrasive particles such as diamond and cubic boron nitride (cbn). it has already been proposed to coat superhard abrasives with a metal which is capable of forming a chemical bond with the particles and alloys with a metal in a metal bond in which the particles are incorporated. it has also already been proposed (see us patent no re 26 879) to form spherical pellets with diamonds at their cores and a green layer of a wolfram carbide-cobalt mixture around the core. in this proposal the pellets are compacted to form a metal bond diamond tool and the formed tool is subjected to sintering conditions in which the wolfram carbidecobalt mixture sinters to hard metal. green pellets of the kind just referred to can be made to be self-sustaining, but not to the extent that they can be handled as articles of commerce. also for a reasonable diamond concentration, the pellets have to be rather large, which worsens the handling problems. of course, the metal bond is then a hard metal bond. an object of the invention is to provide abrasive pellets with cores of super hard abrasive particles which can be used as articles of commerce. in the context of the present invention superhard abrasive particles are natural diamond particles, synthetic diamond particles, cubic boron nitride particles resulting from the crushing of polycrystalline diamond and cubic boron nitride composites. according to the invention an abrasive pellet comprises a core of a superhard abrasive particle1 a coating of a metal around the particle, and an outer sintered metal bounded abrasion resistant layer, the metal coating forming a strong bond with the core and the outer layer. the metal forming a chemical bond is usually a carbide forming transition metal such as va, ta,'and preferably ti. the outer layer may be selected from: hard metals (including all cemented carbides, for example cobalt bonded tungsten carbide), metal bonded nitrides, metal bonded borides, metal bonded silicon carbide, metal bonded diamond powder, for example that in which the diamond powder is in a size range of 10 to 100 microns especially 75 to 38 (200 to 400 u s standard mesh), metal bonded cubic boron nitride powder, for example that in which the powder is in a size range of 10 to 100 microns, and mixtures thereof. also according to the invention a method of making abrasive pellets comprises selecting superhard abrasive particles, coating the individual particles with a thin coating of a metal which is capable of forming or forms a chemical bond with the particle substance, pelletizing the coated particles with a powder mixture capable of sintering to an abrasion resistant material, and then sintering the pellets for an outer abrasion resistant layer to be formed on each particle. description of a preferred embodiment example 1 metal bond diamond particles of sieve aperture 150 to 125 microns; (100/120 mesh) were mixed with titanium powder of sieve aperture
