<ABSTRACT>
Controller for controlling a stepless zero layer associated with a null layer associated with the output shaft in both output directions of rotation, preferably hydrostatic transmission of a vehicle, wherein the control device comprises a pedal (1) which by means of a reversing device (18) in such a way with the gear adjustment lever is connected that in one layer of the reversing device, the pedal movement of the adjustment of the transmission is associated with a direction of rotation of the transmission output shaft and is associated with the other direction of rotation in the other position, wherein the reversing device is connected to an actuating lever (29) and in the control device two parts (3, 9) coupled to counter-rotating movement, of which one of which is connected by means of a switching piece (18) with the gear adjustment lever, wherein the switching piece (18) by means of an electro-magnet (23) switchable is the means a selector switch is switched on, wherein in the circuit, a further, from the position of the gear member depending on the switching of the electromagnet, only for neutral position of the gear member released switch (30) is provided.
