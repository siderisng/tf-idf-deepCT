<ABSTRACT>
anti-malginim tab (target-attaching globulin) products  are used to detect the presence of cancerous or malignant  tumor cells in cell collections.  the anti-malignim tab pro­ ducts upon application to a cell collection attach preferentially  to cancerous or malignant tumor cells present therein in vitro  or in vivo and such cells can thus be detected by any visible or  signal-emitting means attached to said anti-malignim tag  products.

<DESCRIPTION>
detection of cancerous or malignant tumor cells the present invention relates to a process for detecting the presence of cancerous or malignant tumor cells in a cell collection in vitus or in vivo, and more particularly relates to such a process utilising products, herein termed target attaching globulins (tag) prqducts which are derivatives of compounds herein termed recognins, and which are capable of preferentially attaching to cancerous or malignant tumor cells. recognins are made by treating abnormal vells or tissues, for example, tumor cells or artificial cancer cells and separating out the desired-products. by the term "recognin" as used herein and throughout the specification is meant an abnormal cell or tissue associated compound which is characterised by: (a) being capable of forming a single line precipitate with its specific antibody in quantitative precipitation tests and ouchterlony gel diffusion test; (b) being soluble in water and aqueous solutions at acid or neutral ph; (c) being insoluble in aqueous solutions at alkaline ph; (d) having a spectrophotometric absorption peak wave length of 280mu; (e) having a molecular weight of from 3,000 to 25,000; and (f) having an amino acid residue composition in which there is a high proportion of glutamic acid and aspartic acid with respect to the total amino acid residue composition and a high ratio of these acids to histidine. the $ ognins may be used to prepare their çhemoreciprocals, i.e., byrcontacting the recognins or the recognins on a support with body fluids. the chemoreciprocals are useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, i.e., for diagnosing and treating cancers. the chemoreciprocals are substances which react with immunochemical-like specificity with a recognin in vivo in vitro, i.e. in quantitative precipitation test, in ouchterlony double diffusion or in immunofluorescence. one recognin is astrocytin. astrocytin is produced from brain tumor tissue, preferably brain glioma tumor tissue. protein fractions containing the astrocytin preceursor are first extracted from the tissue. a preferred method of accomplishing the extraction is to treat the tissue with a neutral buffer under conditions of homogenization or other techniques to disrupt the cells and tissues in order to solubilize protein fractions which contain the astrocytin precursor. at this point, the astrocytin precursor is still bound to many large molecular weight substances including protein, hlycoproteins, lipoproteins, nucleic acids and nucleoproteins. the solubilized proteins are then separated from the resultant tissue extract. the extract solution from the tissue is then clarified to remove insoluble particles. the low molecular weight contaminants are then removed from the resultant solution, by a pre-evaporation concentration technique. the solution which is obtained is then treated to cleave astrocytin precursor from other contaminants in order to obtain the protein fraction having a pk range between 1 and 4. thus, for example, the solution is placed on a chromatographic column and eluted with increasingly acidic solvents. all of the fractions which are eluted in the neutral or acid range down to pk 4 are discarded and those fractions with pk range of from 1 to 4 are collected. the eluate is
