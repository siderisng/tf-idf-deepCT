<ABSTRACT>
in order to provide plastic chrome or refractory compositions  which have a desirably low swelling or bloating  tendency, without using asbestos or floc, compositions are  introduced, which include hectorite, which is a naturally  occurring or manufactured hydrous magnesium silicate  material.  the refractory compositions contain, by weight  on a dry basis, 85 to 95% of size-graded chrome ore, 1 to  5% of alkali metal silicate binder, 0 to 5% of plasticizer  (other than hectorite) and sufficient water to form a plastic  mass, the amount of hectorite being 0. 5 to 5%.  the hectorite  can constitute the sole plasticizer, but for cost reasons  other plasticizers are also included, plastic clays  being especially preferred.
