<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for setting a machine in operation in dependence upon a data carrier insertable in a read-in unit, having a counter (13) for counting an operating parameter ; output means (32) for the output of the data read on the data carrier and of the counted operating parameter, at least one contact element (6), actuatable by the data carrier and intended to release the machine, being disposed in the read-in unit (2), characterized by control and displacement means (8, 9) for displacing the data carrier in the read-in unit (2), the first contact element (6) actuated by the data carrier actuating the control means (8) for the feed of the data carrier, and the control means (8) actuating a signalling means (10) for transmitting a busy signal to a central location (12), a cut-off element (14) being blocked by the signalling means (10), and the cut-off element (14), actuatable after termination of the working process, actuating reading means (26) for the final reading-out of the data carrier, and the signalling means (10) relaying a busy signal to the central location (12) during the final reading-out operation, and data recorded by the counter (13) being transmitted to the central location (12) by the output means (32), and input terminals (23, 24) being provided for supplying clock signals, so that the necessary operating time of the machine can be determined.
