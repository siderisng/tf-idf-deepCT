<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to emulsified aqueous explosive  blasting compositions having a discontinuous aqueous  phase, a continuous oil or water-immiscible liquid organic  phase, and an emulsifier.  the emulsifier of the invention  comprises a fatty acid amine or ammonium salt having a  chain length ranging from 14 to 22 carbon atoms.  the emulsifier  of the invention not only provides effective emulsification  but also provides crystal habit modification, which  enhances stability and sensitivity and which is a function not  provided heretofore by known emulsifiers.  the invention  also provides a method in which the emulsifier is predissolved  in the liquid organic phase to enhance the ease of  emulsification.  the emulsified blasting compositions can be  used as commercial blasting agents in mining and other  activities.  one exemplary composition according to the invention  comprises from 3% to 6% fuel oil, from 8% to 12% water,  both percentages being by weight based on the total composition,  and an alkylammonium acetate emulsifier.
