<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to laser gyrometers thanks to which an angular velocity is determined by measuring the phase difference between two luminous coffered beams guided in a wound optical fiber, respectively in the direction of the rotation which is measured. speed and reverse. In the gyrometer according to the invention, the two light beams (1) and (2) guided in the fiber are derived from a single spatially separated unit (10) by a two-sided optical element (4) . At the exit of the fiber, they are directed by the same optical element in the opposite direction and form two adjacent parts (21 and 22) of a beam. The measurement of the phase shift between the two parts is based on the movement of the maximum diffraction stain obtained in the focal plane of a lens placed on the path of this beam. The invention applies to the angular gears measurement with a good signal-to-noise ratio.
