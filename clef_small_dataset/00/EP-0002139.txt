<ABSTRACT>
a new form of nerve growth factor having a molecular  weight of about 116,000 and which is stable in dilute aqueous  solutions is obtained from mouse submandibular gland or  mouse saliva.  an extract of mouse submandibular gland or  mouse saliva is subjected to ionexchange chromatography  to recover a component of the gland or saliva rich in the  nerve growth factor and containing proteinaceous material  which does not degrade the nerve growth factor.  the pure  nerve growth factor is obtained by subjecting the component  rich in nerve growth factor to at least one additional  chromatography step, usually two to four, to recover pure  nerve growth factor having a molecular weight of about  116,000.  the pure nerve growth factor and its stable mixture  with proteinaceous material function as a plasminogen  activator to convert plasminogen to plasmin, and this is  useful for the lysis of blood clots.
