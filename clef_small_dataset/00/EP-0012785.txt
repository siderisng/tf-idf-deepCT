<ABSTRACT>
an arrangement in silos for dispersing bulk material  blown into the silo (10) from a blower conduit (14).  a disÂ­ tributor casing (15) provides an inlet passage (27) and at least  three branch passages (28, 29, 30) communicating with the  inlet passage (27).  an intermediate branch passage (28) is  provided in the extension of the blower conduit (14) and has  a flow area which is reduced in relation to that of the other  branch passages (29, 30) which are located on opposite sides  of the intermediate branch passage (28) in acute angles  thereto.  the branch passages (28, 29, 30) are adapted to be  connected each to one branch conduit (16, 17, 18) opening in  the silo (10) from the top thereof and the inlet passage (27) is  adapted to be connected to the blower conduit (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to an arrangement in silos. more particularly, the invention relates to an arrangement in silos for dispersing bulk material when the material is being blown into the silo from a blower conduit through branch conduits connected to the blower conduit, said branch conduits opening from above into the silo and being distributed over the cross-seotonal area of the silo. the input material flow is split into partial @@ when a silo is being filled in order to fill the sil- uniformly and to avoid steep repose angles and in 3t r that material comprising components of different weights shall not be separated during the filling here ne material might not be of a uniform and homogeneous quality or composition when discharged from the sil@. in prior art dispersing devices such as that described in german laid-open specification no. 2,407,045, published october 10, 1974, comprising valve housing having one or more valves, there is a risk of material being left in the dispersing device when the blowing of material is terminated. material left in the dispersing device when the filling of the silo has been terminated can be destroyed by taking up humidity and under unfavourable conditions can form lumps and plugs in the device, which cause difficulties when the silo is to be filled next time. the primary object of the invention is to over the drawbacks referred to above, and according to tn.e invention this is achieved by an arrangement in silos of the kind initially referred to, which is character sized by a distributor casing having an inlet passage and at least three branch passages communicating with the inlet passage, an intermediate branch passage being arranged as an extension of the inlet passage adapted to be connected to the blower conduit, and having reduced flow area in relation to the other branch passages arranged at opposite sides of the intermediate branch passage at acute angles thereto, all branch passages being adapted to be connected each to one branch conduit. the invention provides a simple arrangement for splitting the incoming material flow uniformly into three partial flows without using more or less complicated valve means such as that disclosed in the german laid-open specification referred to above. in the distribut,or casing arranged according to the invention there are no movable parts and the passages provided in the casing can be effectively cleaned by blowing air therethrough when the filling of the silo has been terminated, without any risk of material being left in pockets or other nooks and corners inside the distributor cawing. moreover, it is easy to incorporate the diitributor casing into a supply conduit as a simple connection element without the necessity of using specific supports or other mounting means. in order to illustrate the invention an embodiment thereof will be described in more detail below, reference being made to the accompanying drawing which is a perspective view of a silo, partly with portions thereof broken away, said silo being provided with a dispersing

 claims    1. an arrangement in silos for dispersing bulk material when the material is being blown into the silo from a blower conduit (14) through branch conduits (16, 17, 18) connected to the blower conduit, said branch conduits opening from above into the silo (10) and being distributed over the cross-sectional area of the silo, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by a distributor casing (15) having an inlet passage (27) and at least three branch passages (28, 29, 30) communicating with the inlet passage, an intermediate branch passage (28) being arranged as an extension of the inlet passage (27) adapted to be connected to the blower conduit (14), and having reduced flow area in relation to the other branch passages (29, 30) arranged at opposite sides of the intermediate branch passage (28) at   at    angles thereto, all branch passages (28, 29,  30) being adapted to be connected each to one branch conduit.    2. an arrangement as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that a bushing (31) is inserted into the intermediate branch passage (28) to reduce the area thereof.    3. an arrangement as claimed in claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the bushing (31) is exchangeable.    4. an arrangement as claimed in claim   2    or 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the bushing   (31?    is flared as a diffuser in the intended direction of flow.    5. an arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the passages (27, 28, 29, 30) of the distributor casing (15), adapted to be connected to the blower conduit (14) and the branch conduits (16, 17, 18), respectively, have the boundary surfaces thereof flush with the inside surfaces of the conduits connected thereto.     6. an arrangement as claimed in any of claims  1 to 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that there is connected to the silo (10) in parallel with a ventilating conduit (19) connected to the silo at the top thereof, a further ventilating conduit (20) also connected to the top of the silo, which extends downwards into the silo to a predetermined maximum filling level therein and is provided with signal and/or contact means (22 to 26) actuated by the air flow in said further ventilating conduit.    7. an arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the branch conduits (16, 17, 18) are connected to a cylindrical silo at places which are located at the centres of the sides of an equilateral triangle inscribed into the circular cross-section of the silo.
