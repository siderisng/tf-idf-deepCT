<ABSTRACT>
from a plurality of boards of non-planed, original-sawn  wood, at least each alternate board is divided by sawing the  same longitudinally, and a number of the thus obtained board  parts or lamellae and optionally a number of non-divided  boards are placed together and glued to form a laminate  structure or laminated element having a thickness of at least  four lamellae.  the lamellae are arranged in a manner such  that a cut surface [6] originating from the longitudinally sawn  boards occurs pairwise with an original board edge surface  [7] on the side surfaces of the laminate structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
a idethod of manufacturing wooden laminates by gluing together sawn wood the present invention relates to a method of manufacturing wooden laminates by gluing together sawn wood. previously, wooden laminates have been made by gluing toget pieces of planed, dried wood, i.e. wood which after drying has been planed to a uniform thickness. when attempting to use non-planed wood, difficulties have arisen owing to the fact that the wood, when drying, shrinks or contracts in different ways (the shrinkage at the outer extremeties of a plank or board can be twice as great as the shrinkage more centrally of said plank or board). consequently, a piece of original sawn wood of rectangular cross section is, after drying, thinner at the side edges, where drying is more predominant, than at the centre. when gluing such pieces of wood together, the glue joint has a varying thickness, which results in variations in the pressure when pressing the pieces together and gives rise to the risk that differences in thickness at certain locations multiply so that glue joints having a thickness of over 1 mm can occur, all greatly impairing the strength of the joint. by original sawn wood is meant timber as sawn from the log. according to the present invention there is now provided a method of manufacturing wooden laminates by gluing together pieces of sawn wood, in which method nonplaned wood can be used while avoiding the aforementioned disadvantages originating from the drying of the.r > p#g this possibility of using non-planed wood can result in a saving of material of 5-10%, in comparison with the using of only planed wood. the method according to the invention is characterized in that, of a number of boards of non-planed, originalsawn wood at least each alternate board is divided by sawing the board in its longitudinal direction, and in that a number of thus obtained board parts and, optionally, a number of non-divided boards are placed together and glued to form a laminated element having a thickness of at least four lamellae, said parts and possible non-divided boards being placed together in a manner such that a cut surface formed when dividing said boards longitudinally is located pairwise with an original board edge surface on the side surfaces of the laminated element. by systematically combining in the described manner lamellae edge sides of, because of shrinkage, somewhat differing thicknesses, the differences in thickness due to shrinkage can be equilized. in an embodiment of the invention suited for the manufacture of laminates of broad cross-section, the laminated element is formed by arranging an non-divided board at the top and at the bottom of said laminate and arranging between said boards alternately divided and nondivided boards, the divided parts of said divided boards being placed together with the original edge surfaces facing one another. if the divided boards have large knots in the edges thereof or exhibit wanes, these defects can, in accordance with this embodiment, be turned inwardly, thereby improving the appearance of
