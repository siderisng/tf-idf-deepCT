<ABSTRACT>
a latch mechanism comprising a first member which is  adapted to engage with a second, resiliently displaceable  member (22, 24), characterized in that the engaging portions  of the members being so formed that a force applied to the  members in a direction tending to engage them can cause  resilient displacement of the second member (22, 24) to  permit engagement of the latch mechanism, first, manual  means (34) for disengaging said members (18, 22, 24), and  additional means (44, 46, 48) for moving one of the members  relative to the other when they are in engagement, so as to  disengage the members, whereby the members are disengageable  both by using said first means (34) or by operation  of said moving means (44, 46, 48).
