<ABSTRACT>
this invention discloses a process for the manufacture of  paper having retained therein high levels of starch wherein  such starch is a specially treated, cooked, cross-linked starch  which is added with a poly-electrolyte at the wet end of the  paper manufacturing process or sprayed on the web in the  paper-forming process.  the invention also relates to a novel  wet-end paper additive composition which includes the spe­ cially treated, cooked, cross-linked starch and a polyelectro­ lyte and the improved paper produced therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to use of a cooked, speciallytreated starch product as a paper wet-end additive for the climination of conventional surface sizing. although a small amount of high grade paper is manuvacturez from rag pulp, paper is nanufactured for the most part from wood pulp. there are rt ve different kinds of wood pulp: mechanical pulp (ground wood), semi-chemical pulp, sulfite pulp, sulfate or kraft pulp, and soda pulp. the first is prepared by purely mechanical means, fihe ¯e¯cr. by a combination or mechanical and chemical means, and the other three by chemical means. the mechanical pulp contis substantially all the wood except the bark and that lost during storage and transportation. semi-chen:ical pulps are partially free of lignin. chemical pulps, however, are essentially cellulose, the unwanted lignin and other non-cellulosic components of the wood having been dissolved away by the cooking and bleaching treatment. because of this, chemical pulps are much superior to mechanical and semi-chemical pulps for tine paper making. however, because of the special processing required, they are too expensive to serve as a main source of fiber for the cheaper grades of paper such as newsprint. if the pulp fibers were the only constituents of a paper sheet, the usefulness of the paper would be very restricted because the sheet would be soft, have a yellowish color, and could not be successfully written or printed upon with ink. if the sheet were thin, it would be transparent to matter printed upon the opposite side. it is necessary, ten, to add other substituents, such as sizing or color.ng, agents and fillers to the cell.ulostc fibers to produce paper6 suited to its many uses. many papers, except the absorbent types, filter papers and most packaging papers, must have a finely ground filler added to them, the purpose of which is to occupy the spaces between the fibers - thus giving a smooth surface, a more brilliant whiteness, improved printabilit and improved opacity. sizing is added to the paper, other than absorbent papers and filter paper, to impart resistance to penetration by liquids. common sizing agents added to the pulp before it is formed into a sheet are war enulslons or soaps made by the saponification of rosin with alkali. the sizes are precipitated with alum. such sizing as described in this paragraph is known in the trade as internal sizing. the word sizing is also used in a second context in the paper industry. this second use is known as surface sizing. it differs from the internal sizing previously described in that it is applied to the surface of the paper where it cements the fibers to the body of the paper and deposits a more or less continuous film on the paper surface. surface sizing is used to produce a smooth hard surface which will not catch a pen when the paper is written upon, will not pick off if the paper is printed using tacky inics and will not show feathering of the ink. an
