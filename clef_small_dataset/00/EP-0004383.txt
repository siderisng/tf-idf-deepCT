<ABSTRACT>
a process of forming an image of toner on a latent  magnetic image in a magnetic member followed by direct  transfer to and coalescence on a surface to form a resist  is disclosed.  the surface portion not protected by the transferred  resist toner image is then permanently modified by  etching or plating.  chemically milled shapes are prepared  as well as printed circuits and printing plates.  the printed  circuits may be formed by (1) etching away areas of a metal  surface not protected by the resist, (2) electroless plating  on areas not protected by the resist or (3) electroplating  areas of a metal surface not protected by the resist, removing  the resist, and in the case of (2) and (3), etching away  the metal previously covered by the resist.  an especially  useful toner which forms a resist composition comprises  a binder of thermoplastic resin and plasticizer and magnetic  material present in the binder, compounded to have a tack  transfer temperature of no greater than 110Â°c.  this application is a continuation-in-part of pending  application serial no.  890,973 filed 25 march 28, 1978 by  the same inventors.
