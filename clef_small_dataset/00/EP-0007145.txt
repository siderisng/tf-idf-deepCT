<ABSTRACT>
a container is provided with a partion forming compartÂ­ ments for accomodating wine bottles.  the container has a  triangular cross section and two adjoining side walls (1a, 1b)  are provided with a step (5) directed towards the corner (6)  between the side walls.  a handle for carrying the container is formed by an opening  (9) in said step.

<DESCRIPTION>
nondeformable container the invention relates to a nondeformable container1 having a bottom part and side walls with thereinbetween a partition for a number of subjects, in particular to a container for wine bottles. these containers are commonly known and are used for storing and transporting a number of bottles. these containers have the disadvantage that mostly they have to be handled with both hands, the said containers being provided for that aim with handles on the opposite side walls. another disadvantage of these containers is that they can be stacked bottom-down only, whioh, for example when stacking up containers containing wine bottles, is undesirable because in such a case it is better to be able to stack these containers on their sides. it is an aim of the invention to provide a container which is easy to handle as packing means and easy to transport with one hand by the consumer. another aim of the invention is to provide a container which can be stacked in an upward position and in a position such that the bottles are maintained in a horisontal state. this is attained, according to the invention, by a container having a bottom part and side walls with thereinbetween a partition for a number of objects, in particular bottles, wherein the side walls of the container form a trilateral prism. the trilateral prism form affords stacking of the containers both with the bottoms down and on their sides, since the trilateral prisms fittingly match each other. in order to prevent a wedge effect from occurring on the side as a result of the triangular shape, when stacking up the containers, the container according to the invention has been so designed that two adjoining side walls are provided, at least over a portion of the height of these walls1 with a step directed towards the angle between said side walls. when putting them on their sides, in which case the containers are stacked alternately with their base sides down and with their base sides up, the steps engaging each other, only perpendicular normal forces arise in the area where the steps are located. according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the side walls of the containers provided with a step have an opening in the vicinity of the angle closed in by said walls, and the openings in both side walls thus directly face one another. this results in some sort of handle which facilitates handling by the consumer. according to the invention, it is also possible to vertically stack the containers, the bottom being turned downwards, for instance during transport by trucks. according to the invention this is enabled in accordance with another particular feature of the invention, whereby in the vicinity of one end plane of the trilateral prism, the side walls contain a rabbet and the collar thus formed fits into the interior of the space enclosed by the side walls at the other end plane of the trilateral prism. the invention will be

claims: 1. a nondeformable container having a bottom part and side walls with thereinbetween a partition for a number of objects, in particular bottles, characterised in that the side walls of the container form a trilateral prism.   2. a container as claimed in claim 1, in which two adjoining side walls are provided, at least over a portion of the height of said walls, with one or several parts which, with respect to a flat surface, are protruding end parts which, with respect thereto, are recessed.   3. a container as claimed in claim 1, in which a step lies in the vicinity of the area located at half the width of the side walls and extends as a rib over the entire height of the side walls.   4. a container as claimed in claim 1, in which side walls provided with a step, have an opening in the vicinity of the angle closed in by said walls, while the openings in both side walls are located directly opposite each other and preferably the edges of   ak    opening extend obliquely with respect to he bottom in such a way that the extension of the centre line of an opening intersects the nearest corner line or the extension thereof at a point upwards from the inner end of said opening.   5. a container as claimed in claim 1, in which in a side wall is provided with a number of protruding cams or ribs.     6. a container as claimed in claim 1,   in which    the side wall provided with protruding cams or ribs, adjoins walls provided with a step.   7. a container as claimed in claim 5, in which the came or ribs are divided into two groups with respect to the centre line of the wall an even number being provided on the one side of the centre line and an odd number on the other side.    8. a container as claimed in claim 1, in which the bottom is recessed and designed to receive a triangular plate of closing material with respect to the end edges of the walls, which closing material may be provided with one or several openings for handling the container or for removing said closing material.   9. a container provided with closing material as claimed in claim 8, in which the cloaing material fits in the open end of the container and is made of a relatively nondeformable material.   10. a container as claimed in claim 1, in which close to one end plane of the trilateral prism, the side walls are provided with a rabbet and the collar so formed fits in the interior of the space enclosed by the side walls at the other end plane of the trilateral prism.
