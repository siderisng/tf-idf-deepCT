<ABSTRACT>
1.  drawing machine for making twisted flutes in tubes, consisting of a machine bed (1) with a drawing carriage (3) guided longitudinally displaceably thereon and of retaining devices for the tube (5), in which drawing machine a drawing tool can be connected axially fixedly to the drawing carriage (3), said drawing tool being rotatable by means of a servo-motor (45), during the drawing operation, through a nominal angle of rotation determined as a function of the length of stroke (a) of the drawing carriage (3), according to the desired twist of the twisted flutes, a control loop for position of the angle of rotation being provided to control the servo-motor (45), characterised in that a control loop for the velocity of the angle of rotation, which is superimposed on the control loop for the position of the angle of rotation, is provided, in that there is provided, to preset the nominal angle of rotation, a cam disc (19) which is mounted in the drawing carriage (3) and which can be driven to rotate by means of a precision rack (16) attached to the machine bed (1) approximately along the length of stroke (a) of the drawing carriage (3) and by means of a toothed gearing (17) which engages into said rack and which is coupled to the cam disc (19), in that a device to convert the changes in diameter of the cam disc into a rotary movement is provided, and in that there are coupled in a manner proof against rotation to the device for converting the changes in diameter of the cam disc (19) into a rotary movement a device (47) for measuring the angle of rotation, as a nominal value setter for the position of the angle of rotation, and a tachogenerator (48), as a nominal value setter for the velocity of the angle of rotation, to which there are assigned respectively, in the control loops, a device (50) for measuring the angle of rotation, as an actual-value setter for the position of the angle of rotation, and a tacho-generator (68), as an actual-value setter for the velocity of the angle of rotation, these being coupled to the servo-motor (45) in a manner proof against rotation.
