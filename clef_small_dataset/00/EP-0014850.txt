<ABSTRACT>
For function extension of a modular constructed data processing system consisting of a microprocessor (7), which is connected via a collecting line system (1,2,3) for Steuer signals, addresses and data with one or more per grammable logic gan ordinances (4, 5, 6)Macroin instructions are provided for the standard instruction set of macroin instructions whose microinstruk tion sequences are stored in individual programmable Logika Nord√∂nder.For function extension, these are connected to the macroin instructions per grammable logic arrangements with the collecting system.The operation code for calling an additional function is considered as the address of the additional programmable logic system containing the instruction sequences for carrying out this additional function.
