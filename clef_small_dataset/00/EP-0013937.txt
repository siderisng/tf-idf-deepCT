<ABSTRACT>
an aqueous dispersion of improved stability, said dis­ persion consisting essentially of a mixture of   (a) 10 to 90% by weight of an ethylene/α,β-unsaturat­ ed carboxylic acid copolymer containing 12 to 20% by  weight on an average of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid  units or the metal salt thereof, and   (b) 90 to 10% by weight of an ethylene/α,β-unsaturat­ ed carboxylic acid copolymer containing 5 to 12% by weight  on an average of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid units or  the metal salt thereof,   said mixture containing 8 to 20% by weight on an average,  based on the weight of the mixture, of the α,β-unsaturated  carboxylic acid units, 30 to 80% of which units are present  in the form of metal salts, and said mixture not containing  more than 5% by weight, based on the weight of the mix­ ture, of a fraction of the ethylene/α,β-unsaturated carbox­ ylic acid copolymer having an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic  acid unit content of less than 5% by weight or its salt, and  more than 10% by weight, based on the weight of the mix­ ture, of a fraction of the ethylene/α,β-unsaturated carbox­ ylic acid copolymer having an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic  acid unit content of more than 20% by weight or its salt.
