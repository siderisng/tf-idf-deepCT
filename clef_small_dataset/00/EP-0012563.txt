<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for use photogrammetry and having two  spaced-apart parallel scanning zones (15) to which the pho­ tographs of a stereoscopic pair of photographs are mounted.  an optical scanning system (35, 36, 37 or 35, 36, 71, 73,  75) which is mounted to a carriage (25) is provided for scan­ ning the two scanning zones (15) and for projecting images of  the respective zones to a binocular viewing system (12), and  a secondary optical system (42, 44, 46, 46, 49, 50 or 63, 64, 65  or 83, 84, 73) is provided, preferably on the carriage (25), for  superimposing reference marks (41 or 62 or 82) on the pro­ jected images.  the scanning system is arranged whereby simultaneous  scanning of the two scanning zones (15) can be effected in a  first (y) direction parallel to the scanning zones, and whereby  independent scanning of the two scanning zones can be ef­ fected in a second (xr, xl) direction which is parallel to the  scanning zones and orthogonal to the first direction.  also,  means (48 or 55 or 72) are provided to permit relative (δy)  scanning of the two scanning zones in the first direction or  for optically moving the reference marks relative to one  another in the first direction so as effectively to provide a (δy)  shift.
