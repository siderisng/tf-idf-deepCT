<ABSTRACT>
a method for increasing the boron ¹⁰ content of a neut­ ron absorbing article, such as one in flat, flexible sheet  shape, includes coating a surface of such article with a solidi­ fiable liquid synthetic organic polymeric material, such as a  phenol formaldehyde type resin, applying boron carbide par­ ticles to the polymeric material and solidifying the polymer,  such as by curing to cross-linked permanently set form, so as  to hold the neutron absorbing boron carbide particles in  place thereon.  in highly preferred embodiments of the inven­ tion the boron carbide particles applied will extend beyond  the surface of the coating material and will serve as anchor­ ing means for applications of subsequent coatings and the  plurality of coatings, usually after initial partial curing to sol­ idify them and make them form-retaining, will be perma­ nently cross-linked simultaneously.  in another aspect of the  invention the plurality of flat neutron absorbing articles may  be joined together by contacting surfaces thereof with such a  coating material, preferably containing boron carbide parti­ cles, and curing it.
