<ABSTRACT>
a composite nonwoven fabric (1) for use in dispos­ able surgical items such as surgical gowns, surgical  drapes and the like, comprising at least two melt-blown  hydrophobic plies of microfine fibers (2, 3) of a fiber  diameter of up to about 10 microns and at least one non­ woven cover ply (4).  the nonwoven cover ply may be an  apertured film, a spunbonded ply or an air laid, wet laid  or carded ply of fibers preferably of staple length or  longer and, of particular importance to surgical items,  should be characterized by surface stability.  when a  single cover ply is employed, the exposed melt-blown ply  should be surface stabilized to improve its resistance to  abrasion and pilling.  when additional strength is required,  the fabric may include a strength ply of hydrophobic  spunbonded, air laid, wet laid or carded fibers.
