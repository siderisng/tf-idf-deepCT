<ABSTRACT>
a method of preparing a thermally stable shape selective  catalyst composition comprising a composite of a crystalline  zeolite and a group iia or group viii metal, said zeolite having  a silica to alumina ratio of at least about 12 and a constraint  index, as hereinabove defined, within the approximate range  of 1 to 12, which comprises impregnating and/or ion-­ exchanging said zeolite with group iia or group viii metal  salts, followed by high temperature calcination, to the com­ positions produced thereby, and to the use thereof in catalytic  hydrocarbon conversion processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of preparing zeolitic catalyst composition of improved shape selectivity and thermal stability this invention relates to a method for preparing a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst of improved shape selectivity and thermal stability, and to its use in catalytic hydrocarbon conversion processes. the disproportionation of aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of zeolite catalysts has been described by grandio et al in the oil and gas journal, vol. 69, no. 48 (1971). u.s. patents 3,126,422; 3,413,374; 3,598,878; 3,598,879 and 3,607,961 show vapor-phase disproportionation of toluene over various catalysts. alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with an olefin in the presence of a crystalline metallic aluminosilicate having uniform pore openings of about 6 to 15 anstrom units is described in u.s. 2,290,607. u.s. 3,251,897 describes alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of x- or y-type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, specifically such type zeolites wherein the cation is rare earth and/or hydrogen. u.s. 3,751,504 and 3,751,506 decribe vapor phase alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with olefins, e.g. benzene with ethylene, in the presence of a zst1-5 type zeolite catalyst. in these prior art processes, the xylene product produced has the equilibrium composition of approximately 24 percent para, 54 percent of meta and 22 percent of ortho. the alkylation of toluene with methanol in the presence of a cation exchanged zeolite y has been described by yashima t al in the journal of catalysis 16, 273-280 (1970). these workers reported selective production of paraxylane over the approximate temperature range of 200 to 2750c. with the maximum yield of para-xylene in the mixture of xylenes, i.e. about 50 percent of the xylene product mixture, being observed at 2250c. higher temperatures were reported to result in an increase in the yield of meta-xylene and a decrease in the production of para- and ortho-xylkene. transalkylation of toluene using a catalyst of faujasite or mordenite, a group viii metal, such as platinum, and an additional component of arsenic, antimony, bismuth, selenium, tellurium or -compounds thereof is described in u.s. 3,527,824. of the xylene isomers, i.e. ortho, meta and para-xylene, meta-xylene is the least desired product, with ortho and para-xylene being the more desired products. para-xylene is of particular value being useful in the manufacture of terephthalic acid which is an intermediate in the'manufacture of synthetic fibers, such as "dacron". mixtures of xylene isomers, either alone or in further admixture with ehylbenzene, generally containing a concentration of 'about 24 weight percent para-xylene in the equilibrium mixture, have previously been separated by expensive superfraction and multistage refrigeration steps. such process, as will be realized, has 'involved high operation costs and has a limited yield. the zsm-5 class of zeolite catalysts have been shown to be shape selective this shape selectivity can be further enhanced by the use of very large crystals, impregnation with mg and p to reduce zeolite pore opening and coke selectivation. these modified zeolite catalysts have been very effective in such reactions as selective toluene disproportionation which yields predominantly p-xylene as the product and toluene-ethylene alkylation yielding primarily p-ethyltoluene. these
