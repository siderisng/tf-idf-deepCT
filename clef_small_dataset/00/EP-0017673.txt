<ABSTRACT>
The application deals with a measuring funnel for the mood of the pull-through force of fiber bands. This measuring funnel consists of a fixed part (12) with a funnel-shaped inlet opening (2) and a biased part (10). In the latter, the bore (13) for the passage of the fiber band (1) continues. However, it may have a portion (14) longitudinally rejuvenating the bore. The continuous fiber band (1) thereby exerts on the movable part (10) a force in the continuous direction compensated by pneumatic (P) or electrical means (21, 22), so that the movable part (10) for each fiber band cut An equilibrium layer takes. These equilibrium positions are now transformed by elec trenches (15, 16, 23, 24) or pneumatic probes in ent speaking signals, which in turn are used either for measuring the absolute fiber band cross-section or for regulating to a setpoint of the fiber band cross-section.
