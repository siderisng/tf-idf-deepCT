<ABSTRACT>
1.  travelling monitor apparatus for successively monitoring the operating conditions at each spinning position of a ring spinning machine both as regards thread breaks and also lap formation on the drafting rolls, the ring spinning machine having lowerable thread suction nozzles, with a non-contact yarn sensor which detects the presence of a yarn between the delivery rolls of the drafting mechanism and the spindle, a second sensor which upon detection of a thread break detects the presence of a stream of fibres between the delivery rolls of the drafting mechanism and the thread-break suction nozzle located in its normal operating position immediately under the lower delivery roll, the fibre stream being diverted from its normal path of movement for detection thereof, which second sensor (43, 45) comprises a source (43) of radiation, which sends a beam (44) onto the diverted fibre stream (42), and a radiation receiver (45), which receives the beam (46) affected by the diverted fibre stream (42), and an operating device provided for the operation in the absence of a fibre stream of a roving feed interruptor device at each spinning position of the ring spinning machine characterised in that the monitor apparatus (27) has a further operating device (37-41; 55-63; 71), by means of which the thread break suction nozzle (13) is lowerable from its normal operating position (c) into a detection position (d) adequately spaced from the lower delivery roll (7) for the contact-free detection of the fibre stream (42), so that the second sensor (43, 45) sends a beam (44) onto the fibre stream diverted in this manner.
