<ABSTRACT>
a press for cold-forming tungsten carbide blanks for sin足 tering and fitment to cutting tool bit edge profiles which has  contra-reciprocating compression jaw (9) and ejection jaw (12)  about the centre pin (5), a flat top sealing disc (13), upper  surface of column (4) and curved side plate (26) define and  seal the forming cavity, the compression jaw applying angu足 lar forming pressure to granular tungsten carbide in the cavity  to form a blank, the jaws having a thickness sufficient to  compensate for shrinkage height of a pressed blank during  sintering.  a shrinkage-compensating, graphite sinter fixture with  similar shape and function components to the press cavity-足 forming members has a spool-shaped body split into two  segments (30) and (31) along separation cuts (32) and (33)  with flanged ends (34) and (35) a central longitudinal core (36)  receiving a removeable centre-pin (37), each flanged end hav足 ing a flat portion (39) and (40) on its rim and a curved cover fits  over the spool cylinder section and contacts the top surface of  a blank and presses it down onto the pin, the flat rim portions  cause the segments to press against the blank as they are  off-set and gravity actuated by reaction against a flat surface  when sintered, to counteract shrinkage distortion.
