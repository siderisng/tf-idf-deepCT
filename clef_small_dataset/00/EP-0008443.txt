<ABSTRACT>
the device to transform heat into mechanical energy comprises a rotor (155) including bimetal thermal elements (158), the shaft (151) of this rotor being arranged perpendicularly to a force component of a gravitation field, the bimetal elements (158) mounted within one portion of the rotor being deformed in one direction by the heat to be transformed.  the rotor (155) comprises elements (158) shaped like spokes or bars extending from the rotation shaft (151) of the rotor and arranged within planes containing the rotation shaft of the rotor; these elements (158) shaped like spokes or bares consist of at least one elongated piece formed by bimetal thermal elements.
