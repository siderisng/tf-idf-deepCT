<ABSTRACT>
flexible polyurethane foam is produced by reacting a  polyol having two or three hydrogen atoms as determined  by the zerewitinoff method, water and sufficient difunctional  isocyanate to react with substantially all of the polyol and  water present.  as gel or polymerisation catalyst there is used  a tin compound, i. e.  sn(o. oc. r¹)₂ and as blowing catalyst  there is used a mixture of antimony and potassium compounds,  i. e.  sb(o. oc. r²)₃ and r³. cook, wherein each of r¹,  r² and r³ is c₁-c₁₉ alkyl.  the blowing catalyst may include a  zinc compound, viz.  zn(o. oc. r⁴)₂, r⁴ being a c₁-c₁₉ alkyl.  the  use of the specified blowing catalyst provides unexpectedly  short rise times, that is the time taken for the resultant foam  to reach its final height after initiation of the polyurethane-forming  reaction.
