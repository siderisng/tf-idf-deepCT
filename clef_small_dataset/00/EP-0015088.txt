<ABSTRACT>
a polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit  an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature which enables it  readily to undergo melt processing to form quality fibers,  molded articles, etc.  the polyester of the present invention is  different in character from earlier polyesters and includes as  essential ingredients moieties    derived from para-hydroxy benzoic acid.  1,2-bis (para-carboxyphenoxy)  ethane, terephthalic acid, and substituted  hydroquinone in certain specified proportions.  the polyester  of the present invention generally can be more economically  produced than polyesters of the latter three moieties (two of  which are relatively expensive) while surprisingly yielding an  anisotropic melt of relatively low viscosity at a desirable  temperature for melt processing in spite of the substantial  concentration of relatively stiff para-oxybenzoyl moieties  which advantageously contributes to the overall nature of the  resulting polyester.  in a preferred embodiment the polyester  is capable of undergoing melt processing at a temperature  below approximately 300°c. , and in a particularly preferred  embodiment at a temperature below approximately 290°c  (e. g.  with standard equipment commonly used for the melt  processing of polyethylene terephthalate).
