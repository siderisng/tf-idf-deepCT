<ABSTRACT>
a constant mesh change speed gear more especially for  vehicle use comprises a gear box casing (70) containing rotat­ ably mounted therein layshafts (1, 3) one for each ratio and  disposed about and parallel with an input drive receiving shaft  (5) and an out drive shaft (6) co-axial with the input driven  shaft (5).  the input driven shaft (5) carries a gear (50) in  constant mesh with gears (11) one each on a corresponding  layshaft (1, 3) each layshaft having a further gear (12) in con­ stant mesh with a corresponding gear (60) of a gear cluster  (600) on the output drive shaft (6), one of the gears (11, 12) on  each layshaft being fast therewith whilst the other gear is  adapted to be clutched to its layshaft by a clutch (10, 30) for  effecting a drive at a selected ratio between the driven input  shaft (5) and the output drive shaft (6) via the layshaft (1, 3).   the clutches (10, 30) are mounted at the same ends of their  respective layshafts (1, 3) and are positioned within the gear  box casing (70) at the same end of the latter so as to be  accessible for servicing and/or replacement purposes  through removable or openable covers (71, 73) at said end of  the casing (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
d e s c r i p t i o n change speed gear this invention relates to change speed gear primarily r vehicle transmission and of the kind in which layshaft gearing in constant mesh with input and output shaft gearing includes layshaft gears, arranged to be selectively clutched to respective layshafts in effecting a required drive transmission ratio. the object of this invention is to provide an improved arrangement of change speed gear of the abovementioned kind of simple compact and robust construction and whereby access to the lay gear clutch mechanism is facilitated for servicing and replacement purposes especially in the case of the gearboxes of public service vehicles which are usually subject to frequent use, i.e. during stop/start operation of the vehicle. practical advantages in this and other respects will be apparent from the following disclosure. according to this invention a constant mesh change speed gear comprises a gear box casing containing rotatably mounted therein a plurality of layshafts one for each gear ratio and disposed about and parallel with rot at ably mounted central shaft means of the change speed gear and within said casing which shaft means consists of a shaft for receiving an input drive and a shaft co-axial therewith providing an output drive, the input driven shaft having a gear fast thereon in constant mesh with gears one each on a corresponding layshaft, each layshaft having a further gear in constant mesh with a corresponding gear of a cluster of gears fast on the output drive shaft, one of said gears on each layshaft being fast therewith whilst the other gear thereon is adapted to be selectively clutched to the layshaft by a clutch mounted on one erd of the laysuaft for effecting a drive at a selected ratio via the lsyshaft from the driven input shaft to the output drive shaft, the clutches on the layshafts being positioned within the gear box casing at the same end of the latter and accessible for servicing and/or replacement purposes by removable or openable cover means of the casing at said end thereof. the constructlons and arrangements may be as follows, reference being had to the accompanying dia##a=atic drawings in which:- figure 1 is a generally axial plane section of a gearbox providing a straight throtwji drive, figure 2 is an end view in the direction of the arrow 11 of figure 1, figures 3 to 6 are gear train diagrams of the gears involved for the different ratios, viz first to fourth gears respectively, figure 7 is a sectional plan vien of the gearbox having a side input shaft and shown incorporated in a transverse rear engine installation, figure 8 is a sectional plan view of a modified aide input gearbox and figure 9 is an end view in the direction of the arrow ix of figure 8. like parts are referred to by the same or similar reference designation throughout the drawings. referring to figures 1 and 2 a straight through gearbox
