<ABSTRACT>
a seat of rubber or the like (7) separates the facing supÂ­ port faces of the lid (3) and the frame (1) of the rectangular  cover.  this seat, which in the one case is attached to the  frame (1) and in the other case to the lid (3), is provided with  alternate cams (10) and recesses (11) corresponding to  recesses and cams of the parts, to which the seat is not  attached.  after displacement of the lid (3) in the frame (1), the  lid (3) is secured by these cams (10) and recesses (11).  to  counteract displacement in the secured position, a filling  piece (4) can be applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
a cover such as from metal, for a traffic road surface the invention relates a cover to be mounted i for instance a traffice road, such as from metal and having a seat from rubber or the like, with substantially reactangular cross section, which keeps the confronting support faces of lid and frame separated. in an embodiment of the cover the seat can be attached to the support face of the frame, which has a rectrlgular shape, with rectangular.opening and comprises, at the inwardly directed side, alternately mounted cams extending inwardly with respect to the enclosure face extending downwardly with respect to the support face of the frame and outwardly extending recesses. the matching lid comprises, at the enclosure face directed downwardly with respect to the support face thereof, mutual spaced outwardly extending cams such that in a determined position of the lid, this can be inserted in the frame or can be removed therefrom, but after shifting the lid in the direction of the longitudinal centre line thereof, over the dimension of the lid cam, the lid is secured in upward direction, i.e. it can not be lifted from the frame. to counteract longitudinal shift of the lid, in the secured condition, according to the invention a filling piece, of hard wear-resistant material can be applied, which can mask the free space of the frame opening. in another embodiment of the cover, of which the frame is rectangular with rectangular opening, the seat is attached to the support face of the rectangular lid and the seat comprises, at the outwardly directed side, alternately mounted cams extending outwardly with respect to the upwardly extending enclosure face of the lid and inwardly extending recesses. the molding frame comprises, at the enclosure face extending upwardly with respect to the support face thereof, mutually spaced cams such that in a determined position with respect to the frame the lid can be inserted therein or removed therefrom. after shifting of the lid in the direction of the longitudinal centreline thereof over a size of a seat cam, the lid is secured again in upward direction. by means of a filling piece displacement of the cover can be counteracted in which the filling piece can mask the free space of the frame opening. in a further embodiment of the cover, for instance of the second type, the lid can consist of a number of lid portions and at each end of the frame opening and possibly at larger values of the length thereof, between one set or various sets of lid portions, a filling piece can be used to counteract the shift of the lid portions, in their secured position, and to facilitate removal of the lid portions. the invention will be further elucidated on the basis of some embodiments shown in the drawing. fig. 1 is a drawing in perspective of the frame of a rectangular cover according to a first embodiment, in which the seat is attached to the frame. fig. la shows
