<ABSTRACT>
production is initiated from a well which is kept from  producing by the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid it contains,  by injecting an aqueous liquid that contains reactants which  form nitrogen gas within the well or reservoir which gas  displaces enough liquid out of the well to lower the hydrosta­ tic pressure to less than the fluid pressure in the adjacent  portion of the reservoir and cause fluid to flow from the reser­ voir to the well.

<DESCRIPTION>
starting h5drocarbon fluid production by injecting nitrogen-generating liquid the invention relates to treating a liquid-contalning well by passing a nitrogen gas-generating solution into the well to cause a gas-effected displacement of liquid from the well. more particularly, it relates to "kicking off" or initiating production from a well which is "dead" due to hydrostatic pressure of the liquid it contains; without the necessity of swabbing the well, or injecting nitrogen or other gas which has been co- pressed at a surface location. the process according to the invention for treating a well communicating with a hydrocarbon fluid-containing formation from which production is prevented by the hydrostatic pressure of liquid contained within the well, comprises displacing sufficient liquid from the well to reduce the hydrostatic pressure to less than the reservoir fluid pressure by means of gas generated from at least one aqueous liquid solution which forms or contains a nitrogen gas-forming mixture of (a) at least one water-soluble compound which contains at least one nitrogen atom to which at least one hydrogen atom is attached and is capable of reacting within an aqueous medium to yield nitrogen gas and by-products which are substantially inert to the components of the well and reservoir formation, (b) at least one oxidizing agent which is capable of reacting with said nitrogen-containing compound to form said gas and by-products, and (c) an aqueous liquid which is capable od dissolving or homogeneously dispersing said nitrogen-containing compound, the oxidizing agent and the byproducts of the nitrogen gas-producing reaction. in one embodiment of the invention the nitrogen gas-forming mixture is injected into a production tubing string at a rate such that the gas is formed within and accumulated at the top of the tubing string. the gas is subsequently released to initiate the production of gas from the well and reservoir. in another embodiment of the invention, the composition of the gas-forming mixture and its rate of injection can be adjusted so that at least some of the gas is armed within the pores of the reservoir formation. in still another embodiment, an aqueous solution or dispersion of a foam-forming surfactant is injected, before, during or after the injection of the nitrogen gas-forming mixture, so that a release of gas from the well induces foaming and a foam-transporting of liquid out of the well. water-soluble amino nitrogen compounds, which contain at least one nitrogen atom to which at least one hydrogen atom is attached and are capable of reacting with an oxidizing agent to yield nitrogen gas within an aqueous medium, which are suitable for use in the present invention can comprise substantially any water-soluble ammonium salts of organic or inorganic acids, amines, amides andior nitrogen-linked hydrocarbon-radical substituted homologues of such compounds as long as the substituted compounds react in a manner substantially equivalent to the parent compounds with respect to the production of nitrogen gas and by-products which are liquid or dissolve to form aqueous liquid which are substantially inert relative to the well conduits and reservoir

    c l a i ifl s      1. a process for treating a well   communicating    with a hydrocarbon   fluid-containing    formation from which production is prevented by the hydrostatic pressure of liquid contained within the well, comprising displacing sufficient liquid from the well to reduce the hydrostatic pressure to less than the reservoir fluid pressure by means of gas generated from at least one aqueous liquid solution which forms or contains a nitrogen gas-forming mixture of (a) at least one water-soluble compound which contains at least one nitrogen atom to which at least one hydrogen atom is attached and is capable of reacting within an aqueous medium to yield nitrogen gas and by-products which are substantially inert to the components of the well and reservoir formation,  (b) at least one oxidizing agent which is capable of reacting with said nitrogen-containing compound to form said gas and by-products, and (c) an aqueous liquid which is capable of dissolving or homogeneously dispersing said nitrogen-containing compound, the oxidizing agent and the byproducts of the nitrogen   gas-producing    reaction.   2. the process according to claim 1, wherein the well comprises at least two conduits that are in   communication    near the lower ends thereof, and the generated gas is collected in one of the conduits near the top thereof, and at least part of the liquid in the well is displaced from the well via the other conduit.     3. the process according to claim 2, in which the gas-forming mixture is injected into one of the conduits.   4. the process according to claim 1, in which the gas-forming mixture is injected into a production tubing string present in the well, at a rate such that substantially all of the nitrogen gas produced by each increment of the injected fluid is produced while that increment of the fluid is in the tubing string and substantially all of the so-generated gas is accumulated at the top of the tubing string.   5. the process according to claim 1, in which the gas-forming mixture is injected at least partly into the formation.   6. the process according to   claim,    comprising the consecutive steps of:  injecting into the well a slug of treating liquid;  injecting into the well behind the treating liquid slug at least one aqueous liquid solution which forms or contains the nitrogen gas-forming mixture;  closing the well and allowing the generation of nitrogen gas to displace at least a portion of the treating liquid slug to tie   location    to be treated;  treating the location by the treating liquid; and  producing fluid from the well by   outflowing    gas generated by the nitrogen gas-forming mixture, so that the treating liquid slug is backflowed out of the well.   7. the process according to any one   of the    claims   1-6,    in which the nitrogen-containing compound is salt of ammonia and the oxidizing agent is an alkali metal or ammonium nitrite.   8. the process according to any one of the claims 1-6, in which the nitrogen gas-forming mixture consists essentially of an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite.   9. the process according to any one of the claims 1-6, in which the nitrogen gas-forming mixture consists essentially of an aqueous solution of urea and sodium hypochlorite.     10. the process according to any one of the claims 1-6, in which the nitrogen gas-forming mixture consists essentially of an aqueous solution of urea and sodium nitrite.    11. the process according to any one of the claims 1-10, in which the injected solution contains a buffering agent for maintaining a reaction rate controlling   ph.      12. the process according to any one of the claims 1-11, in which the injection into the well of the nitrogen gas-forming mixture is accompanied by an injection into the well of an aqueous liquid solution or dispersion of a   foam-forning    surfactant.   13. the process according to any one of the claims 1-12, in which the injection into the well of the nitrogen gas-forming mixture is accompanied by an injection into the well of an aqueous liquid solution or dispersion of a water-thickening agent.   14. a process for treating a well communicating with a formation, as described in the specification.
