<ABSTRACT>
A flow agent for concrete and mortar based on lignin sulfonate on the one hand and core sulfonated or sulfomethylated aromatics on the other, in which the mixture of the base materials of a condensation and a sulfitation has been subjected. This fluid is inexpensive and meets all requirements for liquefaction, setting behavior and dosage. In the manufacturing method, a core-sulfonated or sulfomethylated aromate can be sulfonated either with the addition of sulfuric acid and then condensed with urea and formaldehy, or sulfitated with the addition of sodium sulfite and water and then condensed with formaldehyde, followed by lignin sulfonate, with the addition of urea and formaldehyde condensed and sulfitated with sodium sulfite. Starting from a core-sulfonated aromat can also be sulfonated first with the addition of sulfuric acid, whereupon condensed with urea and formaldehyde, then sulfitated, subsequently condensed with the addition of lignin sulfonate with formaldehyde and condensed with urea.
