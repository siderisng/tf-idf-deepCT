<ABSTRACT>
the circuit arrangement according to the invention is used for achieving an enlargement and extendability of the addressable data memory volume by means of a selection system of address and data lines.  in the case of direct addressing with, for example 16 bits, 64k addresses can be formed.  by also utilising the data lines (dat) and applying a preliminary information to the address lines (adr), the addressable memory volume can be significantly enlarged.  the version having two comparators (vg1/vg2) is used when the addressing begins at the start of a memory area or when the individual address directly corresponds to the desired memory cell.  if, however, an address area is presented which does not correspond to the start and end of a memory module, this correspondence is produced by using the adder (adw) so that the required memory cell can be directly reached by means of the single address (low-significance bits).  <image>
