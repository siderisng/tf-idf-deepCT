<ABSTRACT>
Heat-sealable, opaque film made of thermoplastic, organic plastic oriented by biaxial routes and the finely divided, solid, in particular inorganic particles of a size of 0.2 to 20 microns, preferably 2 to 8 microns, and an amount of 1 to 25 weight percent, preferably 5 to 15% by weight, based on the weight of the polymer, wherein the film consists of a polymer or copolymer of an α-olefin with 2 to 6 C atoms and at least one of their surfaces a heat seal layer from a copolymer of the propyleneEthnyen or the propylene with butene or a terpolymer of the propylene with ethylene and another α-olefin having 4 to 10 C atoms.The film is preferably prepared in coextrusion method and can be used in width areas of process engineering.

<CLAIMS>
process for the manufacture of a multilayered, additive-containing, opaque film  which has been obtained by means of coextrusion and is comprised of a  thermoplastic, organic synthetic material having a film thickness of 8 to 100 µm  and being oriented by biaxial stretching, said film consisting of a base layer (1)  which comprises an essentially isotactic propylene homopolymer, and of a  heat-sealable layer (2/3) which is present on at least one of the surfaces of  said base layer (1) and has a thickness of 0.5 to 2 µm and comprises a  copolymer of propylene and ethylene or a copolymer of propylene and butene  or a terpolymer of propylene and ethylene and a further α-olefin having 4 to 10  carbon atoms, characterized in that the base layer (1) contains finely divided  calcium carbonate particles ranging in size from 0.2 to 20 µm, preferably from  2 to 8 µm, and being present in an amount of 1 to 25 % by weight, preferably  of 5 to 15 % by weight, relative to the weight of the polymer, and in that the  melt of the polymer forming the base layer (1), with the finely divided particles  contained therein, on the one hand, and the melt of the polymer forming the  heat-sealable layer(s) on the other hand, are simultaneously and jointly extruded  through a flat die, that the resulting flat film is chilled for solidification,  oriented by stretching it in the longitudinal direction and subsequently in the  transverse direction and is heat-set, whereby the longitudinal stretching ratio is  5.5 and the transverse stretching ratio is 9.0 and the temperature during  longitudinal stretching is 120 to 130 °c and thus is up to 20 °c lower than the     temperature at which a clear film of the same material is normally stretched in  the longitudinal direction. process according to claim 1, characterized in that the base layer (1) consists  of a polypropylene homopolymer with an isotactic proportion of at least 90 %. process according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that the heat-sealable  layer(s) consist(s) of a copolymer of propylene and 1 to 6 % by weight,  preferably 2 to 5 % by weight, of ethylene, whereby the comonomers are  substantially statistically distributed. process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the heat-sealable  layer(s) (2/3) consist(s) of a copolymer of propylene and butene-(1),  whereby the butene-(1) component preferably amounts to 10 to 15 % by  weight of the copolymer, and whereby the comonomers are substantially  statistically distributed. process according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the heat-sealable  layer(s) (2/3) consist(s) of a terpolymer composed of     93.2 to 99.0 % by weight of propylene,     0.5 to 1.9 % by weight of ethylene, and     0.5 to 4.9 % by weight of an α-olefin with 4 to 10 carbon atoms,  whereby the comonomers are substantially statistically distributed. process according to claim 5, characterized in that the heat-sealable layer(s)  (2/3) contain(s) butene-(1) or hexene-(1) as the α-olefin comonomer. process according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the film has a  thickness in the range from 8 to 100 µm, in particular from 15 to 50 µm.    use of the film obtained by a process according to one or more of claims 1 to  7 for packaging purposes.
