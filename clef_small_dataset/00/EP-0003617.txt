<ABSTRACT>
1.  apparatus for switching-over direction of flow in a branching member (13) which is arranged in the main flow path between two gaschromatographic separating columns (s1, s2), said member having a first connection point (a1) which is adjacent to the first separating column (s1) and which serves for the connection of a first auxiliary flow path (h1), and a second connecting point (a2) which is adjacent to the second separating column (s2) and which serves for the connection of a second auxiliary flow path (h2) which is continously traversed by carrier gas from the carrier gas source (tg), and having means arranged in the auxiliary flow paths (h1, h2) for adjusting the pressures prevailing within the latter in order to produce pressure gradients of alternating direction in the branching member (13), characterized in that the first auxiliary flow path (h1) is continuously traversed by carrier gas and consists of a branch element (8) which is connected to the carrier gas source (tg) and leads to the first connecting point (a1), and of branch element (6) which leads away from the first connecting point (a1) and is connected via a fixed flow constriction (k1) to a gas-chromatographic detector (d2), the fixed flow constriction (k1) being so designed that the flow of the auxiliary stream which flows at this point is greater than the flow of the main stream which emerges from the first separating column (s1) ; that the second auxiliary flow path (h2) consists of a branch element (9) which leads to the second connecting point (a2) and of a branch elements (7) which leads away from the second connecting points (a2) and contains a fixed flow constriction, the two branches (9, 7) being continuously traversed by carrier gas ; that means are provided for alternatively adjusting the pressures only in the branch element (8, 9), which lead to the connecting point (a1, a2), of the auxiliary flow paths (h1, h2) ; and that the auxiliary flow paths (h1, h2) ; are each connected via a respective capillary (1, 2) to the connecting points (a1, a2) of the branching member (13) arranged in the main flow path.
