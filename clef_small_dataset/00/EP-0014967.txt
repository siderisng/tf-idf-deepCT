<ABSTRACT>
a bushing having a porcelain portion (7) with its one end  being disposed within a cylindrical mounting flange (16), a  central conductor (1) passing through the porcelain portion  (7) and the mounting flange (16), and insulating fluid sealed  within the mounting flange (16) and the porcelain portion (7)  comprises an adapter (15) adapted to have the central conduc­ tor (1) passing therethrough and fixedly secured to said por­ celain portion (7) at the end with a predetermined gap being  left between it and the mounting flange (16), a sealing  member (20) disposed between the cylindrical part of the  mounting flange (16) and the adapter (15), a damping  member (21) disposed between the confronting flat surfaces  (15a, 16b) of the mounting flange (16) and the adapter (15),  and a spring mechanism (18) to elastically connect the adap­ ter (15) and the mounting flange (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
bushing the present invention relates to a bushing and more particularly to a bushing to be used at the outlet of e.g. a super high voltage transformer in the more than 500 kv class, or a tank type electric machinery and apparatus wherein switchgears are immersed in insulating fluid such as insulating gas, insulating oil, etc. in a case where the electric voltage of the electric machinery and apparatus is high and the environment in which it is used is subject to salt or dust contamination, a long porcelain bushing having a long creepage is used at its connecting portion with the aerial cable so as to resist this contamination evironment. when such an electric machinery or apparatus is used in regions where the frequency of occurrence of earthquakes is high (such as in japan), the machinery or apparatus is designed with a view to such risk of earthquakes. in general, when a bushing mounted to an electric machinery or apparatus is affected by earthquake, there is an amplification of the earthquake amplitude at the ground on which the base and the tank portion of the machinery, and the portions of the mounting seat of the bushing, etc., are mounted. further, when the frequency of the machinery which is determined by the weight distribution and the rigidity, is near to, or correspondsto, the frequency of the earthquake, a resonance phenomenon occurs, subjecting the bushing portion to a very large oscillation by the amplification of the oscillations of the base, tank and bushing mounting seat, which may result in the breakage of the porcelain (portion) by exceeding the breakage strength of the bushing. generally, the frequency of an earthquake lies principally in the range of 1 to 10 hz, and bushing of the plus 220 kv class may have a natural frequency, in its mounted state in an electric machinery or apparatus, of 10 hz, this frequency coinciding with that of an earthquake. according to experience, it has been proved that in a bushing of less than 5 m in length the breakage strength of its procelain portion will not be exceeded even if subjected to the strongest earthquake ever experienced, so that it has sufficient strength; but in the case of the 500 kv plus class using a long porcelain of the contaminationproof type, the natural frequency of the bushing is below several hz, so that it may coincide with the earthquake frequency, and so that there is a risk of breakage of the porcelain under a strong earthquake. therefore, it proved necessary to improve the strength of the porcelain portion under the effect of earthquake. when a bushing of the 1000 kv class is utilized as a countermeasure for increasing its strength against earthquakes, it is conceivable to have the bushing strengthened at its forward end by stay insulators in three or four directions. in this case, the oscillation of the bushing portion becomes a string oscillation so that a phenomenon superimposed by an oscillation other than that of
