<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to oil burner combustion  efficiency improving devices, known as diffusers, and particu­ larly to such devices used in conjunction with gun-type pres­ surized oil burners.  the present invention comprises a for­ wardly positioned cone (12) having a central opening (34) and  a series of holes peripherally spaced around the central open­ ing, a cylindrical member (14) extending rearwardly from the  periphery of the cone, and a back ring (16) having a large  central opening radially extending inwardly toward the cen­ tral opening of the cone.  the diffuser achieves nearly com­ plete combustion of the emanating fuel oil from the spray  nozzle with a minimum of excess air and with virtually no  carbon deposit buildup on it or the oil burner components.
