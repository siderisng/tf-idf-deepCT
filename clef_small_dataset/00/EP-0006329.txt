<ABSTRACT>
wastes e. g.  radio active wastes are encapsulated by  setting under aqueous alkaline conditions a mixture of  unsaturated polyester, hydraulic filler and an initiator which  is activated by aqueous alkaline conditions e. g.  a persulÂ­ phate.

<DESCRIPTION>
encapsulating wastes the present invention relates to a process for encapsulating hazardous wastes. it is known to encapsulate various hazardous wastes by incorporating the waste into a fluid material which is then allowed to set to a solid so as to bind the waste. this enables the waste to be handled more easily and prevents hazardous components of the waste escaping to the environment. thus it is known from british patent specification 1 116 319 to incorporate radio active wastes in bitumen, cement or a polymerisable resin. if bitumen is used the waste must be subjected to the elevated temperatures used to melt the bitumen. this is not always desirable and the requirement for a heating step leads to additional complications. the use of bitumen is not very suitable for wet wastes because the elevated temperature will lead to the evolution of steam which may carry with it hazardous components of the waste and because bitumen is hydrophobic. the use of cement as an encapsulating agent is not very satisfactory as the time required for the cement to set is usually undesirably long. the resulting product is friable and does not retain its structural integrity. british patent specification 938 211 discloses a process for solidifying or encapsulating an aqueous radio active waste by mixing the waste with a finely divided hydraulically setting absorption material e.g. portland cement. after the hydraulically setting absorbtion material has set the resulting dry block is then impregnated with a self-hardening synthetic or casting resin e.g. "palatal p6" sold by basf. this is a mixture of unsaturated polyester and styrene and as is well known in the polyester art such resins are cured by the action of conventional organic peroxide curing agents. the process is an impregnation process and is clearly only applicable to a block which has set and is free from water as otherwise the resin will not penetrate the block. pressure is required for the impregnation process and it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory penetration of the resin into the core of the block. the speed of the encapsulation process is dependent on the setting time of the hydraulic filler. the specification mentions setting times of 2 days. the process is thus not a very satisfactory method of encapsulating wastes. among the polymerisable resins which have been suggested for the encapsulation of wastes are unsaturated polyester resins. thus british patent specification 1 353 121 discloses the encapsulation of a radio active waste in the form of a dry powder using a mixture of (1) an unsaturated polyester prepared from maleic and phthalic anhydride reacted with propylene glycol and (2) a copolymerisabie monomer e.g. styrene. polymerisation is initiated by an initiator such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. while most unsaturated polyester resin systems are not intended to be used in the presence of water there is a well known method of using unsaturated polyester resins in the presence of water, namely in the production of a so-called wep or water extended polyester. this

    claim3:      1. a process for encapsulating a hazardous waste by allowing to set an  encapsulation mixture containing an unsaturated polyester, an  ethylenically unsaturated monomer copolymerizable with said polyester  and an initiator, which mixture incorporates the hazardous waste,  characterised in that the mixture contains a hydraulic filler, the  initiator is an initiator which is activated by aqueous alkaline  conditions and setting takes place under aqueous alkaline conditions.   2. a process according to claim 1 wherein the waste is a radioactive  waste.   3. a process according to either of claims 1 or 2 wherein the waste is a  wet particulate waste.   4. a process according to claim 3 wherein the waste contains 20% to 60%  by weight of water.   5. a process according to claim 4 wherein the waste is an ion exchange  resin.   6. a process according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the encapsulation  mixture is of such a composition   -as    to have a setting time less than  1 hour.   7. a process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the unsaturated  polyester is produced from one or more glycols which are substantially  all ether glycol.   8. a process according to any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the hydraulic  filler includes an alkaline reacting hydraulic cement.    9. a process according to claim 8 where the cement is portland cement.   10. a process according to claims 8 or 9 wherein the hydraulic filler  includes a material which is not an alkaline reacting hydraulic cement.   11. a process according to any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the initiator  is a water soluble salt of a per acid.     12. a process according to claim 11 wherein the initiator is an ammonium  or alkali metal persulphate.   13. a process according to any one of claims 1 to 12 wherein the quantity  of water initally present in the encapsulating mixture plus waste is  5% by weight of hydraulic filler.   14. a process accroding to any one of the preceding claims wherein the  mixture is allowed to set in a mould to form a block which is then  transported to a dumping site.
