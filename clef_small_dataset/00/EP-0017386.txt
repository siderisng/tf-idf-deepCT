<ABSTRACT>
a self-contained pressure sensitive recording material  having reduced tendency of spontaneous background stain­ ing and capable of forming an impressed image of deep  color, comprising a supporting material and coated thereon  a layer composed of (1) a colorless dye as color former, (2) a  phenolic resin or a salicyclic acid derivative or its metal salt  as color developer, (3) starch particles, (4) a pigment and (5)  a binder; either said color former and/or color developer  being in the form of liquid composition and encapsulated in  microcapsules of a melamine-formaldehyde resin as wall  material.  the color developer is a phenolic resin or a  salicyclic acid or a metal salt thereof and the starch particles  are present in an amount of at least 1. 5 times the weight of  the encapsulated material(s).  it is preferable for both the  former and developer to be microencapsulated and for  microencapsulation of the developer to be carried out by in  situ encapsulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
self-contained pressure sensitive recording paper this invention relates to a self-contained pressure sensitive recording paper of novel construction. the pressure sensitive recording paper system generally comprises a combination of a top sheet coated with microcapsules enwrapping a colorless dye as color former and an undersheet coated on one side with a color developer which is an acidic substance such as, for example, activated acid clay, a phenolic resin, or a salicylic acid derivative or its metal salt. when both sheets are placed so that the coated sides may confront with each other, and localized pressure is applied by means of a typewriter or a writing instrument, the intended duplicate record is obtained on the side of sheet coated with the color developer. such a recording paper system has been publicly known and is widely in use. there is also known a self-contained pressure sensitive recording paper comprising a supporting sheet and, coated on one side, to consecutive coatings of a color former-containing microcapsule layer and a color developer layer. this recording paper can be printed with letters by means of a typewriter without using an inked ribbon, or can provide a copy by writing or printing on a superposed ordinary paper sheet. such specific uses recently give rise to increasing demand for the paper. japanese patent application laid-open no. 6,207/72 2s disclosed an improved coater for applying two coating payers in manufacturing the said self-contained pressure sensitive recording paper. further, a self-contained pressure sensitive recording paper of the single layer type applied with a single coating composition containing the color former and the color developer has been disclosed in japanese patent publication no. 16,096/72. although this type of recording paper is improved in regard to spontaneous background staining cself-staining), the present inventors found that said recording paper has disadvantages of marked yellowing and insufficient density of the developed image color, because a hydrophilic film forming polymeric substance impregnated with a phenol a;deyde resin is used as the capsule wall material. japanese patent application laid-open no. 6,413/75 has proposed the addition of gamines to alleviate the selfstaining. although effective to some degree, the addition of an amine in an amount required for the complete prevention of self-staining brings about an interference with the color-forming reaction and also a yellowing tendency of the sheet surface. a method is described in japanese patent publication no. 10,780/72, in which the coating composition is incorporated into the paper web during web foratio. in such a record paper, unlike the coated paper, the color forming reaction takes place within the paper sheet, resulting in insufficierlt density of the image color. further, as disclosed in japanese patent laid-open no. 37,710/74, attempts have been made to prepare a self-contained pressure sensitive recording paper improved lith regard to self-stnining by improving the encapsulation method using the reaction of polyvalent isocyanate, polyhydroxy compound and polyamine compound. although self-staining is improved by the use of a wall material and an encapsulation procedure as disclosed in said patent application, it is necessary
