<ABSTRACT>
the properties and performance of a lubricating oil  containing silicones, and particularly the stability of the  silicone molecules in suspension in the oil, are very significantly  improved if during the addition of the silicones to the  oil the mixture is subjected to a particular heat treatment  and/or an electromagentic energy field, particularly a strong  magnetic field.  in a preferred method of manufacturing the  silicone oil, the silicones, preferably a dimethyl silicone fluid,  (up to 20%) is added to a mixture of an oil (up to 40%), and a  silicone solvent, preferably perchloroethylene, (remainder)  in the presence of a magnetic field to form a silicone-rich  carrier, and the carrier is subsequently added, as a small  proportion, to a base oil, for example an sae 30 paraffinic oil  and again subjected to a magnetic field.  the silicone oil  produced should contain, by volume, not more than 1%  silicone, preferably 0. 2% and not more than 4% solvent,  preferably 0. 4% and is suitable for use as a two stroke oil, an  upper cylinder lubricant, or an engine sump oil.
