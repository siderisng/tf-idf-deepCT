<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to a method for producing O, O-diethyl-O- [1-phenyl-2-cyano-propene (1) yl] -thiono-phosphoric acid esters by reacting a benzoic acid ester with propional nitrile in the presence of an alkali alcoholate at temperatures between 50 and150 ° C and subsequent reaction of the reaction mixture with O, O-diethyl thionophosphoric acid diester chloride, characterized in that the propionic acid adrile used as the starting compound is used in an amount of about 5 to 50 moles per mole of benzoic acid ester, which in the reaction of propionitrile, benzoic acid ester andAlcoholic alcohol from the addition of the O, O-diethylthionophosphoric acid diester chloride distilled off and the volume of the reaction mixture is approximately constant by continuous addition of propional nitrile.
