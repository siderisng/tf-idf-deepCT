<ABSTRACT>
a secam-encoded chrominance signal is converted to a  chrominance signal of a quasi-pal form for further processing  in pal decoder apparatus (40).  the converter includes  an fm detector (17) serving to demodulate respective  secam subcarriers sequentially, and a modulator (23)  wherein the color-difference signals recovered by the fm  detector (17) amplitude-modulate, in appropriate sequence,  quadrature-related phases of pal subcarrier frequency oscillations  derived from the pal decoder (40) via a phase  switching circuit (33).  the color-difference signals supplied  to the modulator (23) are augmented (in 21) by line rate burst  pedestals effecting the insertion of bursts in the quasi-pal  signal developed by the modulator (23).  the phasing of the  inserted bursts alternates between a first phase corresponding  to the oscillation phase subject to modulation by r-y  color-difference signals, and a second phase differing from  the first phase by 180Â°.  insertion of bursts of the first phase  immediately precedes the development of r-y modulated  subcarrier waves by the modulator (23), while insertion of  bursts of the second phase immediately precedes the  development of b-y modulated subcarrier waves by the  modulator (23).
