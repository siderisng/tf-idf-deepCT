<ABSTRACT>
To increase the yield, in the production of field effect transistors, the gate electrode consisting of polycrystalline semiconductor Terial is constructed of several layers. First, a self-conductive polycrystalline semiconductor layer (10) is deposited on the insulating gate oxide layer (9). It is applied to a doped polycrystalline semiconductor layer (11) and on this one further polycrystalline semiconductor layer (12) which is more doped than the semiconductor layer under its lying below it. In subsequent hot processes, a diffusion of the doping diameter is also carried out in the initially independent polycrystalline semiconductor layer, whereby the desired doping profile is obtained. Due to the originally independent character of the first deposited polycrystalline semiconductor layer, grain growth and pore formation are reduced in it. As a result, the attack of the under it is substantially reduced by the gate oxide layer by hydrofluoric acid, resulting in increased yield of field effect transistors.
