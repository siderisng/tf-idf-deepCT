<ABSTRACT>
a problem with prior apparatus is the need for a plurality  of separate apparatuses to supply the controlled members.   the invention solves this problem through the use of a single  valve assembly (25) that controls the supply of pressurized  fluid from a fluid source to first (16), second (30) and third (34)  controlled members, in which the single valve assembly (25)  has a first relief valve segment (46) to relieve the pressure of  fluid flowing from the source to the third controlled member  (34) a second relief valve segment (100) to relieve the pressure  of fluid relieved by the first relief valve segment (46), and a  third valve segment (138) to direct the fluid relieved by the first  relief valve segment (46) to the first (16) and second (30)  controlled members.  a movable lever (26) is connected to the  third valve segment (138) to shift this valve segment (138) and  control the direction of the fluid.  the invention is used princiÂ­ pally in hydraulic circuits for earthworking vehicles to actuate  a plurality of controlled members including a flywheel clutch  (16) and clutch brake (30), and steering clutches and vehicle  brakes (34).
