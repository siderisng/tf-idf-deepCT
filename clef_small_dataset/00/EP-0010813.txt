<ABSTRACT>
a system for transmitting visual information via a low  frequency system, such as a telephone system (6), providÂ­ ed with at least two sections, each being adapted to operate  both as transmitter and as receiver and being adapted to  be coupled to each other via the low frequency system.   each section is an integral unit provided with an image  pick-up camera (1), a device (2) connected therewith for  converting high frequency video signals into low frequency  audio signals or vice versa, an image display device (3)  connected to that device, an acoustic coupling device (5)  connected to the converter (2) for effecting a connection  of the relevant section to the low frequency system (6),  and a control processor (7, 8, 9, 10, 11) for controlling  according to a given program all switching operations  required for the operation of the system.
