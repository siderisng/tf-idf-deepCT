<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for controlling the flow of powder to a point of  use in a powder processing system.  the apparatus includes a  first hopper (16) vibrated at a predetermined frequency to  help assure that the powder is discharged as required onto a  horizontal feeder tube (32) which also has vibrators (40) for  transferring powder along the horizontal feeder tube (32).  the  horizontal feeder tube (32) extends into a second hopper (44)  which then channels tha powder to a point of use, such as a  roll compactor.  a level sensor (33 or 56) equipped with a  probe (35 or 55) determines powder height and acts to control  operation of the vibrators (40) which move powder through  the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
vibratory tube feeder for powder transfer system the invent ion described herein relates to powder transfer systems and more particularly to apparatus which utilizes vibratory forces for transferring relatively dense powder from one point to another in the system. the nuclear fuel powder resulting from the conversion of uranium hexafluoride to uranium dioxide must be transmitted through powder hoppers and feeder tubes before being discharged to pellet forming presses or other equipment used in the powder handling system. the powder is heavy and dense and usually is moved by conventional screw-type feeders or conveyors from one area to another as required by tht manufacturing processes. the helically shaped serew in the conveyor fits close ] y t 0 the convqy()r inner walls and is designed to move powder over the re-- quire(l distance. however, the powder attributes, particumarly its density, causes plugging conditions along the screw length and at the conveyor outlet thus creatillg expensive maintenance and repair procedures. to alleviate this problem, other types of powder transfer systems have been used, such as placing the system under a vacuum and utilizing pneumatic forces to move the powder through the system. the introduction of air however, requires that the system be made essentially airtight and this requirement gives rise to a host of complicated seal problems since health regulations prohibit the escape of uranium or other possibly radioactive powders to the environment. the combined effects of powder compaction and bridging in the auguring method of transferring powder has ereated unretiability in the powder movement system in addition to causing high maintenance costs. @@ @@ therefore the principal object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for efficiently flowing a hazardous powder through a system in a controlled manner that is without clogging and without subjecting the environment to hazards. with this object in view, the present invention resides in an apparalus for controlling the flow of powder through a system comprising a first feed hopper adapted to receive powder to be transferred through a system and having vibrators mounted thereon for facilitating the flow of powder therethrough, a horizontally disposed feeder tube so positioned below said feed hopper as to receive the powder from said feed hopper, enclosure means associated with said feed hopper and feeder tube for preventing the escape of powder to the environment and for containing the powder in the system, a second feed hopper connected to said feeder tube for receiving powder therefroni, second enclosure means interconnecting the feeder tube with the second feed hopper r for containing powder in the system, and means in communication with an outlet opening in the second feed hopper for receiving powder discharged therefrom, characterized in that vibration means are associated with said feeder tube for moving said powder horizontally to the second feed hopper, and said first feed hopper includes a spout loosely fitted in said feeder tube in spaced relationship from the bottom thereof thereby providing a space between the walls of the tube to accommodate displacement
