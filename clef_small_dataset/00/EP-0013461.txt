<ABSTRACT>
a process for the preparation of a segmented thermop­ lastic elastomer, by conversion in a melt system of   a.  one or more -oh and/or -cooh groups-containing bifunc­ tional polyesters or polyester amides having a melting  point not higher than 100°c and a molecular weight in the  range of 500 to 5000, and,   b.  one or more -oh and/or -cooh groups- containing bifunc­ tonal polyesters or polyester amides having a melting  point not lower than 180°c and a molecular weight in the  range of 500 to 5000 in the presence of such an amount of  diisocyanate that the ratio between the number of -nco  groups and functional groups of both the low-melting and  the high-melting compounds is at least 1,0 and et most 1,5,  the transesterification catalyst present in one segment or  in both being deactivated prior to the conversion process.  the polymers resulting from the process may be heated  for several hours at a temperature of 240°c without losing  their elastomeric properties.
