<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for feeding articles to a work station, for  example for feeding electrical terminals to a work station  between the co-operating dies of a crimping machine, has a  first shaft (22) driven by a main shaft coupled through a  clutch to a motor (16) and a second shaft (23) is arranged to  be driven by the first shaft (22) in an oscillatory motion havÂ­ ing a forward motion and a return motion, a cam (29) being  fixed to the first shaft (22) and a cam arm (31) having a cam  follower (30) being secured to the second shaft (23).  the  second shaft (23) has abutment means (35, 36) which engage  against adjustable stop means (37) to limit the extent of  return motion of the second shaft (23), the adjustable stop  means (37) being readily accessible for manual adjustment.   a driven arm (14) is connected to the second shaft (23) for  moving a feed device to the work station and the angular  position of the driven arm (14) relative to the second shaft  (23) being adjustable whereby the foward limit of motion of  the feed device can be controlled.
