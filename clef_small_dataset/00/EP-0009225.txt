<ABSTRACT>
1.  protective circuit for a switch (sw) to which a first capacitor (c1 ) for limiting the voltage increase is connected in parallel via a first diode (d1 ) and to which an choke (la) for limiting the current increase is connected in series, wherein the choke (la) is bridged by the series connection of two diodes (d1 , d2 ) between which lies a second capacitor (c2 ), characterized in that one of the two diodes (d1 , d2 ) is the first diode and the two diodes (d1 , d2 ) are unidirectionally poled, and that the second capacitor (c2 ) is connected to an energy-recovery device (20) in order to obtain effective utilization of energy.
