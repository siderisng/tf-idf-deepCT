<ABSTRACT>
a pin tumbler lock comprises a housing member (41),  a sleeve member (43) axially and rotationally positioned  within the housing member (41) and a plug member (46)  rotatably received within the sleeve member (43).  opera­ tion of the lock requires release of the two shear surfaces  defined by the contact surfaces of the sleeve, housing,  and plug members.  transversely parallel extending bores  (53, 54, 55) formed through the three members receive  elements of a locking stack assembly (51).  the locking stack  assembly includes tumbler pins (56), driver pins (58), change  wafers (59) and locking pins (57).  upon insertion of a proper  key, the interfaces between the locking stack elements  are positioned at the two shear surfaces thereby allowing  operation of the lock.  the sleeve member (43) additionally  includes chambers (61) containing change wafers (59)  and the relative position of the locking pins (57) can be  selectively changed in the locking stack assembly upon  positioning the sleeve member (43) in combination changing  position.

<DESCRIPTION>
pin tumbler locks the present invention relates to pin tumbler locks, and more particularly to pin tumbler locks in which the key combination can be changed. previously proposed locks having provision for changing the key combination have not proved entirely satisfactory as they employ a large number of intricate parts and are extremely complex in construction and operation. certain of these locks have relatively large physical dimensions and are therefore limited to specific applications. also the number of permutations to which the combination may be changed is limited. in addition, certain of these previously proposed locks require special keys which are significantly different from conventional keys. according to the invention, there is provided a pin tumbler lock comprising a housing member, a sleeve member movably received within the interior of the housing member, a plug member rotatably received within the interior of the sleeve member, said plug member having a keyway formed therein for receiving a key, a locking stack assembly comprising elements including a driver pin, a locking pin, a tumbler pin and means for biasing said locking stack elements in contacting relation, said housing and sleeve and plug members each having a bore formed therein in radially aligned relation to receive the elements of the locking stack assembly, whereby a correct combination key positions the interfaces of said locking stack elements at points coincident with shear surfaces defined between said housing and sleeve and plug members and actuating means for operatively connecting said sleeve and plug members for moving said sleeve member axially within said lock, said actuating means being operative upon positioning a correct combination key in the keyway and upon rotating said plug member substantially out of a position in which the bores through said housing and sleeve and plug members are in radially aligned relation. preferably, to allow changing of the lock operating combination, change wafer bores are formed radially through the sleeve member at positions axially and circumferentially displaced from corresponding bores in the sleeve which receive elements of the locking stack assembly. the sleeve member is operatively connected for selective positioning in a combination changing position. in the combination changing position, the change wafer chambers are positioned in radial alignement with the bores extending through the plug member and the housing member. at least one, but preferably two, change wafers are positioned within and carried by the change wafer chamber. upon rotational and axial movement of the sleeve member to the combination changing position, at least one change wafer in the change wafer chamber is transferred into the locking stack assembly and a corresponding number of change wafers previously in the locking stack assembly is transferred into the change wafer chamber. as a result, the interfaces between at least some of the elements of the locking stack assembly are positioned at different radial depths, thereby resulting in change of the lock combination when the sleeve member is rotated out of the combination changing position into its normal lock operating position. to effectively change
