<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to nitro compounds which show  activity as histamine h₂-receptor antagonists.  the compounds  of the invention are of structure    where het is an optionally substituted 5- or 6- membered  fully-unsaturated heterocycle containing at least one nitrogen  atom, or a furan or thiophene ring substituted by a  substituted or unsubstituted aminoalkyl group; z is sulfur,  methylene or oxygen, m is 0, 1 or 2, n is 2 or 3 with m + n  being 3 or 4; r³ is hydrogen or various substituents; and r⁴  is hydrogen or lower alkyl; and acid addition salts thereof.   the compounds can be prepared by condensing appropriate  moieties containing the het and pyrrole portions of the  desired product.  the compositions of the invention contain  at least one of the compounds of the invention, and a  pharmaceutical carrier.
