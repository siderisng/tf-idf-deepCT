<ABSTRACT>
an all metal printing sleeve having a slight internal  taper for fitting to a similarly tapered printing roll, applying  air under pressure to outlets intermediate the ends of the  roll to expand the sleeve slightly.  the sleeve has an inner  metal layer (41), e. g.  of copper or zinc, and an outer electroÂ­ plated metal layer (42), e. g.  of copper.  the inner layer may  be sprayed in molten form onto a forming mandrel (38)  having a slight taper and provided with a release coating  (39).  the sleeve may be removed from the forming mandrel  by applying air under pressure to outlet holes (22) in the  mandrel.  a sprayed-on first layer may be transferred from  the forming mandrel to a plating mandrel by heating the  sleeve to expand it slightly.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to printing rolls, and is especially applicable to rolls suitable for accepting photo-originating designs, such as used in the gravure or lithographic printing processes. conventionally, a gravure printing surface is provided by etching the surface of a metal printing roll. the production of the roll and the need to replace or discard it after use makes the process very expensive, and only suitable for relatively long printing runs. in ep 0000410 there is disclosed a printing sleeve of tapered internal surface and parallel external surface. it has two or three layers of different metals all electrolytically deposited, the outer or middle layer resp. being ground to uniform outside diameter. this disclosure falls under art. 54(3) epc. us-a-4024045 discloses the production of a simple metal sleeve by electrolytic deposition on a roller and its subsequent removal therefrom. the roller can be tapered to facilitate removal or the sleeve can be expandable by internal overpressure, and may have a chromium release coating. we have previously proposed in be-a 856427 improved methods of producing printing rolls, particularly for flexographic printing. a sleeve made of plastics material, preferably reinforced plastics material, is fitted onto a roll core which can be of metal construction. thus, for different printing jobs different sleeves can be used with a common roll core. in order to assist in getting the sleeve on and off the core, the internal diameter of the sleeve is slightly larger at one end than the other, and the external diameter of the core is similarly slightly larger at one end than the other so that the sleeve can be slid partly onto the core before it wedges. the core is provided with apertures in that region which is initially covered by the sleeve and through which compressed air can be forced to slightly expand the sleeve so that it can be slid fully onto the core. the present invention, however, provides a sleeve substantially as described in the foregoing paragraph, but made in novel manner entirely of metal so as to provide a conductive path from the inside to the outside of the sleeve to assist in electro-plating the outer surface of the sleeve. more particularly, the invention provides a method of making such a sleeve, comprising taking a generally cylindrical mandrel the external diameter of which is slightly larger at one end than the other, and optionally having fluid outlet apertures in a region intermediate its ends, coating the outside surface of the mandrel with a release agent, applying non-electrolytically a first layer of metal over the outside surface of the mandrel, grinding the outside surface of the first metal layer to provide it with a uniform external diameter and electroplating an etchable second metal layer onto the first metal layer. suitably at least one, and preferably both, of the metal layers are copper. it is particularly preferred that said second layer is copper. the outer surface of the second metal layer can be finished in conventional manner to provide

<CLAIMS>
1. a printing sleeve for fitting to a printing roll  one end of which is of slightly larger diameter  than the other end, the sleeve being similarly  dimensioned so that it can be mounted on the  roll by sliding it on lengthwise until it covers  fluid outlet openings in the roll intermediate the  ends of the roll, applying fluid under pressure to  the outlets to slightly expand the sleeve, and  then sliding the sleeve the rest of the way onto  the roll; characterised in that the sleeve (10) is  made entirely of metal and has which contacts  the roll and has a cylindrical  outermost surface, and an etchable  electro-plated outer metal layer (42). 2. a printing sleeve according to claim 1  wherein both the inner layer and said electroplated  layer are of copper. 3. a printing sleeve according to claim 1  wherein the inner layer is of zinc and said  electro-plated layer is copper. 4. a method of making a printing sleeve for  fitting to a printing roll one end of which is of  slightly larger diameter than the other end, the  sleeve being similarly dimensioned so that it can  be mounted on the roll by sliding it on lengthwise  until it covers fluid outlet openings in the  roll intermediate the ends of the roll, applying  fluid under pressure to the outlets to slightly  expand the sleeve, and then sliding the sleeve  the rest of the way onto the roll; characterised  in that the method comprises taking a generally  cylindrical mandrel (38) the external diameter of  which is slightly larger at one end than the  other, coating the outside surface of the mandrel  with a release agent (39), applying non-electrolytically  a first layer (41, 43, 48) of metal  over the outside surface of the mandrel, grinding  the outside surface of the first metal layer to  provide it with a uniform external diameter, and  electro-plating an etchable second metal layer  (42) onto the first metal layer. 5. a method according to claim 4 wherein  said first layer is provided by spraying molten  metal onto the outside surface of the mandrel. 6. a method according to claim 4 or claim 5  wherein the sleeve is removed from the mandrel  by applying fluid under pressure to fluid  outlet apertures in the mandrel to slightly  expand the sleeve and allow it to be withdrawn  axially from the smaller diameter end of the  mandrel. 7. a method according to claim 5 wherein  after applying the first metal layer (48) the  sleeve is transferred from the first mandrel to a  plating mandrel (50) at which the second layer  is electro-plated. 8. a method according to claim 7 wherein  the sleeve (48) is removed from the first mandrel  by heating it to a higher temperature than  the mandrel so that it expands relative to the  mandrel and can be withdrawn axially therefrom. 9. a method according to claim 8 wherein  the sleeve (48) is slid axially onto the plating  mandrel (50) while at a relatively higher temperature  so that it contracts to fit the plating  mandrel (50) tightly on cooling. 10. a method according to any one of claims  7, 8 and 9 wherein the end portions of the  sleeve (48) extend beyond the body of the  plating mandrel (50), the ends of the sleeve  being closed by members (52, 54) which seal  against the inside surface of the sleeve, whereby  the end faces of the sleeve (48) are exposed  for plating.
