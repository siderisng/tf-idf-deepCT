<ABSTRACT>
a gas compressor or blower having a piston rod 88 carryÂ­ ing pistons 162, 173 working within cylinders 161, 172.  the  piston shaft is driven to rotate and reciprocate so that each  piston rotates and reciprocates in its respective cylinder, ports  being provided to allow induction and after compression  exhaust the gas from each cylinder during such movement.   each cylinder comprises a plurality of circumferentially  adjoining sealing segments (such as 203, 204) supported from  bridge pieces (such as 104, 106) by adjusting bolts (such as  (114, 123).  each segment can be set independently of the  others relative to support plates 101, 103) so that the clearance  between the inner surface of the segment and the confronting  surface of the piston is sufficiently low to limit axial leakage  between the piston surface and the segment surface without  the need for any piston ring and to limit leakage to or from  respective ports form in certain of the segments both axially  and circumferentially of the piston.
