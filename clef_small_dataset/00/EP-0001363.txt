<ABSTRACT>
1.  sealing device for the lower end of a filling pipe of a liquid product cistern, comprising at least one tubular element, vertically movable along its axis, so as to penetrate into the interior of the cistern, closed at its lower end by a sealing plate, and equipped with lateral openings for the passage of the liquid, in front of which a cylindrical envelope can place itself, which is mounted in a sliding position on the pipe and connected to the sealing plate, in the closed position, by a tight joint, the said envelope being arrested by support lugs on the cistern, when the pipe penetrates into the interior of the latter, and being taken in charge by the pipe again on the rising part of the latter, so as to close the side openings, characterised in that, in the closed position, the sealing plate (4) can penetrate into the interior of the envelope (62) and that the tight joint is an inflatable joint (41), mounted between the sealing plate (4) and the internal wall of the envelope (62) and capable of being immediately inflated when the envelope (62) is taken in charge by the pipe (21, 22) on the rising part of the latter.
