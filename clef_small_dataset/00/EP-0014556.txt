<ABSTRACT>
a multiplex information handling system for a vehicle  has a number of transmitters and receivers  all interconnected by a common power bus pb and signal  bus sb (50).  the transmitters transmit signals along the signal  bus representing the operational state of control equipment  or equipment controlled by that equipment and the receivers  respond to and act on such signals to, for example, authorise  the display of information received or the initiation of a con­ trol function.  system management (5a, 5b, 53 54) and super­ vision (6c, 65) is provided for such that the transmission of  certain signal states is made dependent upon the state of  other signals in the system and this dependence can be over­ riden, for example, for vehicle servicing.  supervision also  provides for certain urgent signals to be given priority over  or signals.
