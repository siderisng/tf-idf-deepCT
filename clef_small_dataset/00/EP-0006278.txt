<ABSTRACT>
a breakaway pipe coupling which, in use, is located  in the pipeline extending between a movable tanker, such  as a sea vessel, and a storage tank.  the purpose of the  coupling is to provide a weakness in the pipeline so that a  pull be exerted on the pipeline which exceeds a predeter­ mined value, the coupling will break and quickly close off  the pipeline to prevent spillage.  the coupling includes a main body portion (31)  and a breakaway portion (20), valve means (60) in the  main body for closing the conduit (14) passing through  the coupling, actuation means (70) being provided for  operating the valve means to close the conduit (14) on  removal of the breakaway portion from the main body por­ tion and dampening means (76, 80) for controlling the rate  at which the valve means closes the conduit.
