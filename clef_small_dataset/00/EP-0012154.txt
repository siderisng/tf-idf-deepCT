<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a peeling head for copying peeling of wire, rods and pipes with a raw number of peeling knives. Each peeling knife (6) is mounted in a knife holder (8). This in turn is hinged on a slider (13) which is adjustable in a slider (7) radially adjustable with the possibility of locking. The slider (7) is mounted radially movable in the blade head radially to the workpiece. The knife holder is elongated. It is pushed to the workpiece from a spring (12) which is supported on the slider. With the help of the spring and the pivotability of the knife holder, the knife also follows such contours of the workpiece cross section, which are not exactly round. The steering point of the knife holder is chosen so that the resulting vector of the cutting force passes through. Each peeling knife is a tactile pin (17) is arranged. From the position difference between the stylus and the main pitch of the peeling knife, the chip depth results.
