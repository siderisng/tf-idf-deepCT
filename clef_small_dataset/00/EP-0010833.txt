<ABSTRACT>
a fixing device (10) which can be mounted in a hole  (18) in a structural member (19), such as a floor beam,  and which can be engaged by an external component,  such as part of a pipe support arrangement, in order to  mount the latter on the structural support member (19).   the fixing device (10) can be manipulated between a first  position in which it presents minimal transverse cross-­ section so as to move upwardly through the hole (18) and  thereafter to a second position in which the device presents  a maximum transverse cross-section and engages diametri­ cally opposed regions of the surface of the structural sup­ port member (19).  the device (10) comprises a coupling  portion (11) which can be seated in the hole (18) when  the device (10) occupies the second position, and is inter­ nally tapped in order to receive part of a pipe support ar­ rangement.  a retaining portion (12) takes the form of an  elongate plate and is rigidly connected to the coupling por­ tion (11) in order to engage the diametrically opposed  regions of the surface of the structural support member  surrounding the hole (18).  a handle portion (13) is pivotally  mounted on the device (10) to enable the device to be  manipulated between the first and second positions, and  projects downwardly from the coupling portion (11) through  the hole (18) when the device occupies the second posi­ tion.  the handle portion (13) then provides visual indica­ tion of the location at which an external component may be  secured in position, and preferably can be detached subse­ quently from the coupling portion (11) when the external  component has been connected thereto.
