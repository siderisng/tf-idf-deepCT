<ABSTRACT>
tracer control apparatus, for a tracer machining system,  has a memory storing position a, along the pickfeed axis,  of the first clamping feed in initial tracing of a clamping feed  area h1 and position b at which clamping feed is absent after  initial tracing of area h1.  using the stored positions the apparatus causes repeat  tracings back and forth between a and b.  clamping level setting means 11 to 15 set an initial  clamping level lcz for clamping feeds in initial tracing of area  h1, and add increments inc to that level for successive repeat  tracings.  only when the incremented clamping level is not reached  in a repeat tracing, or the incremented level reaches a limit  value, does tracing proceed beyond area h1.  the clamping  level is set back to its initial value.  a method of machining is provided in which repeat  tracing is carried out only in areas where required, e. g.  h1, in  dependence upon stored positions a and b and incrementing  clamping levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
tracer control apparatus for, and a method of machining in, a tracer machining system. this invention relates to tracer control apparatus. when tracer machining it is general practice in conventional profile working to set up a clamp level and carry out tracing until the tracer head tracing the model surface reaches the clamp level, and then to perform clamping feed, thereby to prevent excessive working of a workpiece (e.g. excessive depth of cut). a clamping feed is a feed carried out at a predetermined machining level, corresponding to the clamp level. repeated tracings are carried out and the clamp level is changed after each tracing. eventually profile working in a clamping feed area is completed after a plurality of tracings have been effected. in such conventional profile working, when clamping feed is required at a plurality of areas over a tracing area, profile working involves a plurality of tracings not only at those areas but at non-clamping feed areas also, resulting in the profile working involving a waste of time. according to the present invention there is provided tracer control apparatus, for a tracer machining system operable to effect tracing by tracing feeds and pick feeds and to effect clamping feeds at a preset clamping level, characterised by memory means for storing a first position along the pick feed axis, which position corresponds to the first of a succession of tracing feeds in the course of each of which clamping feed is effected in an initial tracing, and for storing a second position along the pick feed axis, which position corresponds to a tracie > < feed, following next after the last tracing feed of the succession, in the course of which clamping feed is not effected, means operable in dependendeupon the first and second positions as stored in the memory means to cause tracing between the first and second positions to be repeated, back and forth between those positions, and clamping level setting means for setting an initial clamping level in respect of the initial tracing from the first to the second position, and for changing the clamping level for respective subsequent repeat tracings between the first and second positions until, in such a repeat tracing, clamping feed is not effected at the changed clamping level set for that tracing or a limit clamping level value is reached, whereafter the initial clamping level is set once more, and tracing proceeds beyond the second position. according to the present invention there is also provided a method of machining in a tracer machining system that is operable to effect tracing by tracing feeds and pick feeds and to effect clamping feeds at a preset clamping level, characterised in that the method comprises: in an initial tracing, storing a first position along the pick feed axis which position corresponds to the first tracing feed of a succession of tracing feeds in which clamping feed is effected and storing a second position along the pick feed axis which position corresponds to a tracing

<CLAIMS>
claims   1. tracer control apparatus, for a tracer machining system operable to effect tracing by tracing feeds and pick feeds and to effect clamping feeds at a preset clamping level, characterised by  memory means for storing a first position along the pick feed axis, which position corresponds to the first of a succession of tracing feeds in the course of each of which clamping feed is effected in an initial tracing, and for storing a second position along the pick feed axis, which position corresponds to a tracing feed, following next after the last tracing feed of the succession, in the course of which clamping feed is not effected,  means operable in dependenceupon the first and second positions as stored in the memory means to cause tracing between the first and second positions to be repeated, back and forth between those positions,  and  clamping level setting means for setting an initial clamping level in respect of the initial tracing from the first to the second position, and for changing the clamping level for respective subsequent repeat tracings between the first and second positions until, -in such a repeat tracing, clamping feed is not effected at the changed clamping level set for that tracing or a limit clamping level value is reached, whereafter the initial clamping level is set once more, and tracing proceeds beyond the second position.   2. apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a counter arranged for counting pulses from a pick-feed axis position detector of the system, wherein the memory means are operable to store the first and second positions in terms of the counts   reacheci.hv    the counter for those positions, the count correspondlto the first position being entered into the memory in response to the occurrence of clamping feed, in the first of the succession of tracing feeds, and the count corresponding to the second position being entered into the memory in response  to the absence of clamping feed in the next tracing feed after the last of the succession.   3. apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the clamping level setting means comprise a first register holding the initial clamping level, a second register holding a clamping level increment, and a clamping level setting counter operable to derive the changed clamping levels for each of the said respective subsequent repeat tracings by adding the said increment to the clamping level applicable to the last preceding tracing.   4. a method of machining in a tracer machining system that is operable to effect tracing by tracing feeds and pick feeds and to effect clamping feeds at a preset clamping level, characterised in that the method comprises:  in an initial tracing, storing a first position along the pick feed axis which position corresponds to the first tracing feed of a succession of tracing feeds in which clamping feed is effected, and storing a second position along the pick feed axis which position corresponds to a tracing feed, following next after the last tracing feed of the succession, in the course of which clamping feed is not effected,  in dependence upon the stored positions, executing repeat tracings back and forth between those positions,  in respective such repeat tracings after the initial tracing,   changing the clamping level from an initial clamping level value applicable to the initial tracing, until in such a repeat tracing clamping feed is not effected at the changed clamping level set for that tracing or a limit clamping level value is reached,  then, setting the initial clamping level once more and tracing beyond the second position.
