<ABSTRACT>
the internally-reinforced plastic frame is for doors and windows, and comprises two separate halves.  these are virtually symmetrical and of the same volume, and their mitred portions are welded in a mirror image pattern before an internal peripheral angular frame is fitted between the halves.  this frame can extend into the mitred portions, and it can be in one or more pieces, and of metal or wood.  one or both the frame halves can have a stop section, and they can be profiled to allow insertion of a sealing strip to secure the glass in place.  they can be held together by screws passing through them to screw into the reinforcing core.
