<ABSTRACT>
the change of angular acceleration sensor has a wire  wound rotor (44) resiliently mounted (at 40, 42) for rotation  about a sensing axis (3:3) and has a magnetic field produced  by permanent magnets (14, 16, 18) at right angles to the  sensing axis and across the wound rotor so that a signal  voltage is generated in the windings by the motion of the  windings in the field in accordance with the third time derivaÂ­ tive of angular motion of the sensor about its sensing axis.
