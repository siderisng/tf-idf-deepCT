<ABSTRACT>
a detergent product comprises a water-permeable  closed bag containing a particulate detergent composition  with a bulk density of at least 0. 5 g/cc.  the bag material may  be insoluble and formed from paper or plastics material  sheet.  the pore size distribution of the bag material is  selected in relation to the particle size distribution of the  detergent composition to give less than 5% dusting.  the bag  may contain conventional detergent compositions and/or  other fabric treatment materials.  the high bulk density powÂ­ der enables the bag to be smaller with a saving in the bag  material or to be less completely filled which gives better  powder discharge in the wash.

<DESCRIPTION>
detergents products tecknical field niche invention relates to detergent products which are suitable for treating fabrics in a washing machine and which contain detergent compositions in particulate foria background art although the marketing of particulate detergent compositions packaged in cartons is common practice, this imposes constraints both on their formulation and methods of production. for example the compositions must be free flowing and have an attractive appearance to the consumer, and the ingredients should not segregate during transport and storage. the products must also be safe, both for contact with the skin and in the event of accidental ingestion; in particular, the compositions should not contain too high a level of alkaline materials, although alkalinity is beneficial for detergent properties. when using 'washing machines which have a rotating drum in which the fabrics are placed, there can also be substantial losses of conventionally dosed detergent powder by retention in the dispenser and by its accumulation in the dead spaces beneath the drum, such as the drain hose. it has been proposed previously to market powdered detergent compositions in packages, each of which contain a suitable amount of a detergent powder for an individual wash under standard washing conditions. in particular, the detergent powders can be contained within bags of water permeable or water-soluble materials, such as polyvinylalcohol, but such packages have not yet met with much commercial success. one of the reasons for this is believed to be the higher cost of packaging the detergent powders in this way which has outweighed the increased convenience in using the products. disclosure of tee invention we have now found that improved products of this type can be made by substantially increasing the bulk density of the detergent compositions used, which decreases the packaging costs and may also enable cheaper production methods to be used. according to the present invention a detergent product comprises a particulate detergent composition, the bulk density of which is at least 0.5 g/cc, contained within a closed water-permeable bag. the bag may be formed of natural or synthetic, woven or non-woven materials, which preferably are water-insoluble. while the preferred detergent composition is a fully formulated detergent composition, it may be constituted by any other fabric treatment material. as the conventional spray dried detergent compositions which have been proposed for. inclusion within bags before have bulk densities of the order of 0.3 to 0.4 g/cc, there can be a significant reduction in the size of the detergent bags whilst still containing enough weight of the detergent composition in teach bag for effective fabric washing. by using a detergent composition of high bulk density, the same weight of detergent composition can be contained in the same size bag, while enabling the bag to be less tightly filled. an alternative or additional advantage of filling the bag less tightly is that a greater rate of release of powder into the washing machine may be achieved. in addition, the use of a higher bulk density for the detergent compositions, enables one to

 claims   1. a detergent product comprising a closed water-permeable bag containing a particulate detergent composition, characterised in that the particulate detergent composition has a bulk density of at least about 0.5 g/cc.   2. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised in that the closed water-permeable bag is formed of a waterinsoluble material.   3. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised in that that material of which the closed water-permeable bag is formed is coated with a water-soluble or removable water-insoluble agent to reduce dusting.   4. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised in that the bag is closed by seals formed by heat-sealing or cold pressure sealing.   5. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised in that the particulate detergent has a bulk density of from about 0.6 to about 0.8   g/cc.         6. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised  in that the detergent composition is selected from fully  formulated detergent compositions, bleaches, bleach   precursors     fabric softeners, starch, perfumes, anti-bacterial agents,  anti-static agents, whitening agents, blueing agents, stain  removing agents and mixtures thereof.    7. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised  in that the material of which the closed water-permeable bag  is formed has a porosity which is such in relation to the particle size distribution of the particulate detergent    composit on    that no more than about 5% of the particulate detergent   composition    can pass through the material.    8. a detergent product according to claim 7, characterised  in that no more than about 1% of the particulate detergent  composition can pass through the material.    9. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised  in that the amount of particulate detergent composition  contained in the closed water-permeable bag is less than  50% of the maximum amount of such detergent which the bag  could contain0 10. a detergent product according to claim 1, characterised  in that the bag includes at least two compartments containing  different detergent ingredients, at least one of said  11. a detergent product acording to claim 1, characterised   in    that the pore size of the bag material is sufficient to allow water and also particles of about 10 microns and smaller to pass through and in that the bag material has a weight of less than 60 g/m2.
