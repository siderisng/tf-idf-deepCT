<ABSTRACT>
a disk file for storing data is disclosed which comprises  two major separable assemblies, an hda assembly (13) and a  disk drive assembly (14).  the hda assembly has two separate  carriage units each of which function to position a plurality of  magnetic transducers in transducing relationship with a different  group of magnetic disks which are mounted on a common  horizontally disposed disk spindle journalled at (26b).  the disk drive assembly has an integral baseplate whose  front section is generally u-shaped in cross-sections permitting  the lower portion of the hda assembly which surrounds  the magnetic disks to be positioned within the opening  defined by the opposed surfaces of the u-shaped front portion.   the front portion is open to accommodate the positioning  of the hda assembly on the drive assembly by a horizontal  loading motion the drive portion of the baseplate is provided with a  horizontally disposed shelf portion to which the magnetic  structure of a voice comotors are mounted.  the annular flux  gaps of the voice comotor are positioned to receive voice  coils which are permanently associated with the carriage  units of the hda the drive assembly further includes a motor which is  disposed beneath the horizontal shelf portion and which may  be coupled to drive the spindle of the hda assembly.  additionally,  an air supply system (20) including a blower which is  connected directly to the spindle motor shaft is provided to  supply contaminant free air to the hda assembly.
