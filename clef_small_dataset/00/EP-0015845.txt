<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new esters obtained by reaction of a formula: with a butadiene-1,3 of formula: wherein R₁ represents an alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R₂, R₃, R₅, R₈ and R₉ identical or different are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R₄, R₆ and R₇ represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, at least at least one of them being a hydrogen atom, R₁₀, R₁₁, R₁₂ and R₁₃ represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, at least one of them being A hydrogen, R₁₄, R₁₅, R₁₆ u₁₇ atom identical or different representing each a hydrogen atom or a Kyle radical, in the presence of a compound of rhodium and a cool al. These esters can be used as an intermediate for the preparation of alcohols after hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis and soap after hydrogenation and saponification.
