<ABSTRACT>
in such a reel, the expansion mandrel has annular elastic expansion elements (3, 20) which are seated next to one another in axial series on a mandrel core (2) connected to the reel shaft and alter their outer diameter by a pressure-means-controlled cross-section deformation.  in order to obtain an expansion mandrel which has a continuously smooth surface despite a large expansion area, the expansion elements (3, 20) are resiliently enclosed by a slotted mandrel casing (7), preferably made of spring steel, the circumferential length of the mandrel casing (7) corresponding to the circumference of the expanded mandrel (1).  the expansion elements (3, 20) are hollow in design and are directly subjected to pressure means.  <image>
