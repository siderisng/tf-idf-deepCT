<ABSTRACT>
Reference voltage source (RG), in particular for ver strong circuits in which the reference voltage is pending to the interconnected bases of two transistors (T1, T5), one of which is switched as a diode (T5) while the other (T1) is operated normally. In the collector current of these two transistors (T1, T2), a current mirror circuit (T4, T5, R1, R2) is inserted, to which another in the current mirror circuit is belonging to the transistor (T6) connected in series, which in series with a reference potential (0) Losed corresponding transistor (T8) is connected, the base of which is connected to emitter resistors (R6, R7) of that transistors (T1, T2), the reference voltage is present at the base. The reference voltage is taken from the connection point between the collector and the emitters of the series-connected transistors (T6, T8) for the thus supplied amplifier circuit (VS). There are still further current mirror circuits (T7, T9, T10, T11, T12, T19; T15, T16, T17, T18, T22; T25, T26) provided by which a symmetrical operation of the amplifier circuit (VS) is enforced.
