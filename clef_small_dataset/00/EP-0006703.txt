<ABSTRACT>
a method of making on site, a ground anchor com­ prising an anchor element (9) having a corrosion proof  sleeve (1) secured to an end portion of the element, com­ prises locating a number of lengths of the sleeve (1) about  the end portion of the element (9), applying a cap (11) to  the end of the sleeve, and supplying a self-setting compo­ sition via the cap into an annular clearance (15) between  the sleeve (1) and the element (9).  the cap (11) may be  left in place to seal the end of the anchor and to protect  the anchor during insertion into a borehole.  the sleeve (1)  preferably comprises an outer layer of plastics, an interme­ diante layer of set filler and an inner layer of metal.  the in­ vention includes the sleeved anchor element and the slee­ ve lengths themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
g.r s anchors this invention concerns ground anchors for use in the civil engineering, construction and mining industries for exarple, there is a requirement for ground anchors to have at least a double corrosion protection about the central anchor element, such as that provided by a waterproof sleeve which is grouted on to the element. such anchors are known, but the sleeves are applied to the anchor element in a factory and each anchor must be purpose-built. this makes it expensive to manufacture and transport a small number of anchors for a specific application, and there is often a long delay before the anchors can be delivered to the site of use. there is therefore a need for a simple and cheap way of corrosion proofing an anchor element on site to specific requirements, and this invention fulfills that need. according to the invention there is provided a method of at least double corrosion proofing an anchor -nt on site, comprising (i) locating a sufficient number of lengths of corrosion proof sleeve in erd-to-end relation about an end portion of the anchor element to cover the length of the element to be corrosion proofed, (ii) applying a cap to the sleeve at the end of the anchor element, the cap having an inlet for self-setting composition, and (iii) supplying a self-setting composition through the inlet, via the cap; into an annular clearance between the element and the sleeve there to set to secure the sleeve to the element. preferably the cap is secured to the anchor element by earns of the self-setting composition to seal the end of the anchor against ingress of moisture and to protect the leading end of the anchor during insertion into a borehole. the sleeve lengths will usually be connected together such that the sleeve is sealed against escape of self-setting composition during introduction of the composition into the sleeve. preferably the sleeved anchor element is upvrardly inclined away from the cap for best escape of air whilst the self-setting composition is supplied into the sleeve. the inlet is preferably located in the side of the cap. when the anchor is upwardly inclined for introduction of selfsetting composition, the inlet is less liable to damage in this location, and the inlet is less likely to become blocked by dirt. the sleeve preferably has at least two corrosion-proof layers. it is especially preferred for the sleeve to comprise three layers, the intermediate layer being of set filler such as a resinous or a cementitious grout and at least one of the other two layers being of plastics. most preferably the sleeve comprises an outer layer of plaatics, an intermediate layer of set filler and an inner layer of metal. the metal inner layer serves to strengthen the sleeve for handling purposes. me the anchor element may be a bar such as macalloy or dividag bar having either a plain or a ribbed profile. plain bars may be used with threaded nuts and plain washers, the nuts
