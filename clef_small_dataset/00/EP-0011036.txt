<ABSTRACT>
a control system for hydraulic servomechanisms com­ prising a doubleacting jack the working chambers of which  are selectively and alternately connectable to a source of  pressurized fluid and to a fluid discharge through a reactive  switching valve which itself is operated by a control  member.  according to the invention, there are provided between  the valve and each working chamber of the jack means for  intercepting the passage of fluid toward said chamber as  long as the upstream pressure does not reach a predeter­ mined threshold value.  the application may be advantageously used in power-­ assisted steering systems for automotive vehicles.
