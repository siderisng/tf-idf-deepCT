<ABSTRACT>
polycarbonate copolymers from bisphenol-a containing  terephthalate or hydroquinone moieties in the range of  about 3 to 10 mol percent of the polymer, whereby after  long exposure to working temperatures the polymer retains  izod impact resistance of at least 6 ft. -lbs.  per inch (3. 203  j/cm) of notch.

<DESCRIPTION>
description polycarbonates with suppressed aging characteristics background of the invention polycarbonate polymers from bisphenol-a molecules, linked together by carbonate linkages as obtained by condensing bisphenol-a and phosgene, are a well known and very useful class of polymers. one of their defects, however, which has been noted in studies by a number of workers, is the drastic drop in impact resistance of these polymers resulting from thermal treatment at temperatures between 700c. and the polycarbonate glass transition temperature of about 1500c. for example, such loss of impact resistance is discussed in an article by l.j. broutman et al. in polymer engineering and science, vol. 16 of 1976, page 74. it has been proposed heretofore to modify polycarbonate polymers by introducing polyester units into the polymer chain, in particular polyester units from bisphenol-a ("bpa") and terephthalic acid ("tpa"), together with carbonate units from phosgene (usp 3,169,121 of feb. 9, 1965 to e. p. goldberg). a thorough reinvestigation of such copolymers resulted in greatly improved products, especially improved in melt processability and heat deformation temperature or glass transition temperature, t . (allowed u.s. patent g application serial no. 764,623 of prevorsek and kesten filed fez. lit 1977). such copolymers have mol ratios of the bpa:tpa:carbonate moieties in the range 1:0.4:0.6-1:0.65:0.35. moreover it has been disclosed that polycarbonates can be obtained from phosgene and polyfunctional phenols such as hydroquinone, which polycarbonates "are insoluble in customary solvents and decompose at their melting temperatures". (usp 3,028,365 of april 3, 1962 to h. schnell et al. - col. 1, lines 15-20). summary of the invention we have now found that the above noted rapid loss of impact resistance in polycarbonate polymers can be dramatically reduced by copolymerizing only small amounts of tpa moieties, or alternatively hydroquinone ("hq") moieties or a mixture of tpa and hq moieties, with polycarbonate polymers, namely amounts of such moieties in the range between 3 and 10 mol percent of the polymer, corresponding to mol ratios of bpa:tpa or hq moieties from about 1:0.05 up to 1:0.2. thereby, instead of dropping precipitously, when measured on a 0.125 inch thick (3.175 mm) plate, to a plateau of less than 3 ft.-lbs. per inch (1.601 j/cm) of notch in ten hours or less of heating at 1200c., the impact resistance of the resulting copolymer remains at least 9 ft.-lbs. per inch (4.805 j/cm) of notch for tpa and at least 6 ft.-lbs. (3.203 j/cm) for hq copolymers over times of heating such as 90 hours or more at 1200c. or above. moreover the copolymers are soluble in solvents such as dichloromethane and can be molded in fused state to form impact-resistant articles. the improved polycarbonate copolymer of the invention, having improved resistance to embrittlement, consists predominantly of bisphenol-a moieties joined together by carbonate linkages, wherein the improvement consists of copolymerized terephthalate moieties and/or hydroquinone moieties constituting between 3 and 10 mol percent of the polymer, such that the polymer after exposure in the form of a 0.125 inch (3.175 mm) thick plate to temperature of

we claim:    1. polycarbonate of improved age-resisting properties, consisting predominantly of bisphenol-a moieties joined together by carbonate linkages, wherein the improvement cpnsists in a content of copolymerized terephthalate and/or hydroquinone moieties constituting between 3 and 10 mol percent of the polymer, such that the polymer after exposure in the form of a 0.125 inch (3.175 mm) thick plate to temperature of 1200c for at least 90 hours retains izod impact resistance at room temperature, as measured by astm test d256 of at least 9 ft.-lbs. per inch (4.805 j/cm) of notch for poly(bisphenol-a/terephthalate/carbonate) and at least 6 ft.   lbs.    per inch (3.203 j/cm) of notch for poly(bisphenol a/hydroquinone/carbonate).     2. polycarbonate of claim 1 wherein the moiety copolymerized with bisphenol-a and carbonate is the terephthalate moiety.    3. polycarbonate of claim 1 wherein the moiety copolymerized with bisphenol-a and carbonate is the hydroquinone moiety.    4. polycarbonate of claim 1 wherein the content of the copolymerized moiety is about 5 mol percent of the polymer.
