<ABSTRACT>
a sectional ingot mold (10) formed of a plurality of side  wall sections (12,14,16,18) which when assembled define at  least the side periphery of a mold cavity, with means coacting  on the side wall sections for coupling the wall sections  together into an integral unitary ingot mold (10); said means,  providing for automatic compensation for expansion and  retraction of the mold assembly sections when molten metal  is poured into the ingot mold by providing for expeditious  expansion of the mold assembly sections with respect to one  another while aiding in sealing the mold sections from leak­ age of molten metal during the pouring and cooling of the  ingot in the mold.  in certain embodiments, yieldable gasket  (34) material is disposed between the wall sections at their  junctions for aiding in preventing leakage of molten metal  from the ingot mold assembly during pouring and solidifica­ tion of an ingot in the mold.  the interior surface (22) of each  mold section may be sinuous for aiding in stress relief of the  formed ingot while aiding in reducing external skin cracks of  the ingot or leakage of molten metal from the mold and/or the  interior (22) of the newly formed ingot.
