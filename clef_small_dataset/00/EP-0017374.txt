<ABSTRACT>
a narrow single stripe contact double heterostructure  injection laser device in which, in the laser chip 80, dielectric  waveguiding in the transverse direction in avoided and gain  guiding promoted thereby producing an astigmatic optical  output with a relatively wide spectral emission and near field  pattern.  the astigmatism is corrected with an astigmatic  microlens 83 adjacent the output facet of the laser chip.   preferably the microlens is substantially semicyclindrical.

<DESCRIPTION>
injection laser devices this invention relates to stripe contact double heterostructure injection laser devices. the simple form of double heterostructure ga(l x)alxas (xo) laser, having a flat active layer sandwiched between two flat layers of material having a higher band-gap and lower refractive index than that of the material of the active layer, typically has a much greater efficiency than homostructure gaas lasers. this is because the heterostructure provides a measure of optical dielectric waveguiding and injected carrier confinement. the refractive index difference at the two heterojunctions provides a dielectric wave guiding effect in the direction normal to their planes, and similarly carrier confinement in this direction is provided by the difference in bandgap at these two heterojunctions. in the direction of the laser axis the heterojunctions provide no dielectric waveguiding effect and no injected carrier confinement; but then none is required. in the transverse direction both appear to be desirable in the interests of laser efficiency, but neither are provided by planar heterojunctions. various ways and means have been proposed for providing at least a measure of optical dielectric waveguisng, or injected carrier confinement, or both, in the transverse direction. among these are included the buried heterojunction structure and the intersecting p-n and hetero-junction structures described in our uk patent specification nos. 1 273 28h, 1 494 518 and uk patent application no. 13957/77 (g.h.b. thompson 10, 19, and 23-6), the parallel etched tracks structure described in our uk patent specification no. 1 258 560 (g.h.b. thompson et al 12-10-1), the rid structures described in our uk patent specifications nos. 1 531 238 and 1 558 642 (g.h.b. thompson et al 20-2 and 22-4), the channelled substrate structures described in our uk patent specification no. 1 530 525 (p.a. kirkby 2) and uk patent application no. 05811/78 (g.h.b. thompson 25), the stress-indueed laser waveguide structures described in our uk patent application no. 2,029083a (p.a. kirkby 5), and the double stripe contact laser structures described in our uk patent specification no. 1 557 072 (c.k.l. goodman et al 9-5). if no such steps are taken to provide dielectric waveguiding or injected carrier confinement in the transverse direction, it has been customary to confine the width of the active region, that is the population inverted region, of the laser by using a stripe contact for one of the laser electrodes, and by arranging for the active layer to be as close as possible underneath this contact so as to limit the lateral spread of the current that occurs in the intervening region. typically the stripe contact may be 20 microns wide and situated about 2 microns above the active layer. in such a device the profile of the injected carrier concentration across the width of the active region of the lasing threshold exhibits a distinct plateau about 20 microns wide which falls away relatively steeply over the next few microns. the present invention is concerned with single stripe contact double heterostructure injection laser devices in which the stripe contact is much

claims:   1. a single narrow stripe contact double heterostructure injection laser device including a laser chip and associated astigmatic lens wherein the stripe contact is sufficiently narrow for there to be no significant plateau in the injected carrier distribution profile measured across the width of the laser at the lasing threshold current, characterised in that the astigmatic lens is a microlens located adjacent the output facet of the laser, and in that the astigmatic power and positioning of the microlens is such as to compensate the natural astigmatism of the laser output beam.   2. a laser device as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the laser chip is bonded to a heat sink provided with a front surface substantially flush with the output facet of the laser.   3. a laser device as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that the microlens is bonded to the front surface of the heat sink.      14.    a laser device as claimed in claim 1, 2, or 3 characterised in that the microlens is a planoconvex cylindrical microlens.    5. a laser device as claimed in clam   4    characterised in that the thickness of the lens is substantially matched with its radius of curvature.   6. a laser device as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the microlens forms part   of a    compound lens system which forms an enlarged image of the near field pattern of the laser viewed through the microlens, the size and emission cone angle of which image matches the core size and acceptance angle of a single mode optical fibre having a numerical aperture of 0.18.     7. a laser device as claimed in any preceding claim characterised   in    that the laser chip is   made    of gal-xalxas   (x#0).
