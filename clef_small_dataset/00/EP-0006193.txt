<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for ultrasonic stitching of objects, in particular of the human body, with an ultrasonic scanning head (14), which rotatably by means of articular arm (10) about a vertical central axis (3) on one of base foot (1) and pivot boom (4) is mounted soil stand, wherein the vertical central axis (3) in imagined extension through a slide (25) isozen trum for radical cuts to be legend to the central axis at orientation of the articulated arm. The structure of such a device is desired, which is particularly easy to handle at the cutting level setting. In particular, the device mass to be moved should be small, so that a rotation of the entire scanning system can be carried out without the need for an auxiliary person directly at the workplace from the examination person. This is achieved in that at a bottom-resistant central foot (1) as the base of the ground stand about a vertical central axis (3) which is carried by this central base (4) is rotatably hinged as a carrier for the articulated arm (10) and that the slide (25 ), preferably movably displaceable, via the floor-resistant central base (1) and the boom (4) pivotable below the carrier is arrangable.
