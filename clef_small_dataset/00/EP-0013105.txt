<ABSTRACT>
a dust cover (5,7) formed of a flexible material for sealing  a space between a body member (1) and a shaft (2) which is  movably received in the body member the dust cover having  one end portion (5a, 7a) secured to the shaft and the other end  portion (5b, 7b) secured to the body member, the two end  portions being interconnected by a thin intermediate portion.  in order to prevent the intermediate portion from being  damaged during assembly and in order to provide a more  effective seal the other end portion (5b, 7b) of the dust cover  secured to the body member sealingly engages with the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
descrition "a dust cover fo }'or sv g x space between too d3r?s" the invention relates to a dust cover for sealing a space between two members and more particularly for sealing a space between a body member and a shaft which is received fittingly in the body member so as to prevent the ingress of dust, water or the like into the space. a known dust cover is formed of a flexible material such as rubber or the like, with one end portion thereof sealingly secured to a shaft at a position where the shaft projects out of the body member, and the other end portion thereof being secured to the body member. the end portions are connected by a thin, intermediate portion which accommodates the relative movement between the shaft and the body member. however, in dust covers of this type, the sealing function is solely attained by the thin intermediate portion thus the sealing function will be decreased when the thin intermediate portion is aged or impaired. further, in mounting this type of dust cover and in fitting the shaft into the bore the thin intermediate portion, particularly, the portion adjacent to the end portion secured the body member will sometimes displace radially inwardly to contact with the circumference of the shaft and, thus, be carried into a bore of the body member and become trapped between the shaft and the body member. accordinglytheintermediate portion may be damaged. in accordance with the present invention there is provided a dust cover formed of a flexible material for sealing a space between a body member and a shaft which is received fittingly in the body member, one end portion of said dust cover being sealingly secured to a portion of the shaft projecting out of the body member, and the other end portion of said dust cover being secured to the body member characterised in that the inner circumference of said other end portion of the dust cover which is secured to the body member also sealingly engages with the shaft. an advantage offered by the invention is that the sealingness can reliably be maintained even if the tbin flexible intermediate portion of the dust cover would be damaged. the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate two embodiments of the invention as applied to a hand brake mechanism in a disc brake, in which: fig. 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of the essential portion of a hand brake mechanism of a disc brake; fig. 2 is an enlarged partial view of the essential portion of sig. 1; fig. 3 is a view similar to fig. 1, but showing a second embodiment of the invention, and fig. 4 is an enlarged partial view of the essential portion of fig. 3. in fig. 1, designated at 1 is a main body or a body member of a disc brake. the body member 1 receives rotatable therein a
