<ABSTRACT>
a method for the manufacture of an amino-formaldehyde  resin.  an amino compound is reacted with  formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in the liquid phase, the  latter being ensured by the presence of a reactive modifier in  the reaction mixture.  the reactive modifier comprises an amino-formaldehyde  resin which is capable of reaction with further  monomers and capable of rendering the mixture of reactants  liquid at least at the temperature at which the reaction is to  be carried out.  an amino-formaldehyde resin obtained by this method.
