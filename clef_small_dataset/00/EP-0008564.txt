<ABSTRACT>
1.  control arrangement for the automatic switching of the lighting system of a vehicle, especially of a bicycle, from generator operation to battery operation and vice versa, in which the battery (b) can be charged by the generator (g) the arrangement comprising a control circuit with a first transistor (t1 ), a first resistance (r1 ) and a second resistance (r2 ) in order to switch off the power supply of the lighting system from the battery when the battery voltage falls below a prescribed value, together with a changeover switch (c) which switches off te control circuit in the position, characterized by the generator (g) being connected to the lighting system (la, lp) by a parallel circuit, which contains a first diode (d1 ) in a first parallel branch and a second diode (d2 ) in a second parallel branch, in which the chargeable battery (b) is connected to the parallel branch belonging to the second diode (d2 ), with the second diode (d2 ) having its polarity such that discharging of the battery through the generator is prevented, and that after the point of attachment of the battery (b) the emitter-commutator stage of a second transistor (t2 ) is included in the parallel branch of the second diode (d2 ), with the base of the second transistor (t2 ) being connected by a third resistance (r3 ) to the commutator of a first transistor (t1 ), the emitter of which is connected with the base through the second resistance (r2 ) and through the first resistance (r1 ), with the emitter of the translator (t2 ), the parallel circuit containing the diodes (d1 , d2 ) is connected to the lamps headlamp lp and rearlamp la of the bicycle lighting system ; the other terminals there may be of the generator (g), of the chargeable battery (b) and of the lamps (lp and la) are earthed, with the changeover  switch (c) in one switch position (a) connecting the emitter of the first transistor (t1 ) with earth, whilst in a second position (m) it connects the commutator of this transistor (t1 ) with earth, and in a third switch position (0) it connects neither the emitter nor the commutator of the first transistor (t1 ) with earth.
