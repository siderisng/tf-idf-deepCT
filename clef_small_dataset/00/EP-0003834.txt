<ABSTRACT>
a retainer for skis and ski poles which, when used in two  or more, forms a unitary assembly of a pair of skis and ski  poles.  each retainer comprises a web band (10) for encircling  a pair of skis in bottom-to-bottom parallel alignment and,  attached thereto, a clamp block (45) having a pair of parallel,  coextensive through bores (44, 46) for receiving the ski poles  and a lock (53, 54) to secure said clamp block in gripping  engagement of the received ski poles.  preferably the entire  retainer is molded of a resilient elastomer, e. g. , rubber and  the like.  the assembly of the skis and ski poles employs a  pair of the retainers, at opposite ends of the assembly securing  the skis in parallel, bottom-to-bottom array, and a parallel  array of the ski poles.
