<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method for biological total purification by the sludge activation method in which wastewater, which has been preliminarily purified in the coarse rake, fine rake and any sand trap, and air, in particular compressed air, or commercial oxygen, are brought into contact and interaction with activated sludge (bio matter) for purification, including oxidation, nitrification and any denitrification, said activated sludge being formed on adhesion bodies, in the form of open-pore, flexible, sponge or foam-plastic bodies, which are alternately compressed and expanded again, characterized in that the wastewater is routed in a single stage over a freely movable bulk of lumpy adhesion bodies 10-100 cm**3 in size, having a density of 15-30 kg/m**3 in size, having a density of 15-30 kg/m**3 and a pore size of 0. 3-3 mm, or a specific pore surface area of 0. 5-6 m**2/l, until nitrification and any denitrification, said adhesion bodies being circulated in a rotary container rotating at a peripheral velocity of 0. 05-2 m/min.  and thereby being raised above the water surface into the air or oxygen atmosphere.
