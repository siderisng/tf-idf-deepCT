<ABSTRACT>
in a latent heat storage container for receiving chemical latent heat storage media, at least one wall side of a chemical container is designed in such a manner that it can be flowed through by a heat transfer medium, is compression-proof and seals off and/or supports the chemical container on at least one side.  in a special design, the latent heat storage container consists of a flat pressure vessel part (1) for receiving the heat transfer medium, and a housing (2) placed thereon, which, by means of gastight connection to the pressure vessel, forms a gastight container (3) for receiving chemicals (fig.  2).  the latent heat storage container can be arranged in modular style on latent heat stores of any size and makes possible, in a compact construction, an extremely economical use of energy.  <image>
