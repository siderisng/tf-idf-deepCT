<ABSTRACT>
the water curtain which falls over a back plate 14 is gen­ erated by entrainment ducts 15 through which air is drawn by  fan 30 to lift water from the back region 11 of the tank.  the wa­ ter curtain falls into the front region 10 which is divided from re­ gion 11 by a wall pierced only by transfer opening 16 below the  water surface.  a venturi unit with collecting chamber 24 and  delivery pipe 25 removes floating paint from the water surface  in front of opening 16 and delivers it through baffle 18 into a re­ gion defined by baffle 19.  the paint-laden water flows along  this region under the water curtain, passing over one or more  transverse baffles, before passing around the far end of baffle  19 to return through region 20, ensuring that paint is dispersed  and sinks before reaching opening 16.  the back plate 14 is pi­ votally mounted at its lower end and adjustable on bracket 34  to vary the air extraction gap between the upper edge of plate  14 and the lower edge of weir plate 33.
