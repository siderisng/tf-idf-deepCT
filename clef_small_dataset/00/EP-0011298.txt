<ABSTRACT>
an all-position carburetor having an air fuel mixing pas­ sage with a rotary throttle valve (14) rotatably disposed in the  carburetor body (12) across the mixing passage.  the throttle  valve has an opening therethrough to provide a venturi pas­ sage (26) in conjunction with the mixing passage.  a by-pass  groove (30,32) is formed in the outer surface of the rotary  valve (14) on the bearing surface (28) of the body to allow fuel  which might otherwise accumulate in a pocket, in certain  positions of the carburetor, to flow into the main air fuel  mixture, thus avoiding overrich conditions when the car­ buretor is turned from one position to another.
