<ABSTRACT>
a nonwoven fabric is prepared by simultaneously heat­ ing and compressing a nonwoven web of organic fibers which  contains a bonding quantity of water as defined in the descrip­ tion.  compressive force and temperature and time of web  exposure thereto are correlated to provide a wash stable  fabric, but the correlation is such that wash stable bonding of  an otherwise dry web is not obtained.  a "dry" web is one  containing equilibrium water content at 65% relative humidity  at 22°c.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for making nonwoven fabrics by bonding organic fibers this invention relates to processes for bonding organic fibers. more specifically, the invention relates to such processes wherein water is utilized as an agent for effecting autogenous bonding of fibers constituting nonwoven webs. nonwoven fabrics and the utilization thereof are well known to those skilled in the art. such fabrics are prepared by forming a web of continuous filament and/or staple fibers. such webs, as formed, are generally lacking in physical integrity and readily disintegrate when handled. therefore, it is customary to increase the integrity of such webs by bonding the fibers constituting the web at fiber crossover points. fiber bonding has been successfully accomplished by mechanical entanglement of web fibers; application of adhesives; and autogenously by the use of heat or liquid or gaseous agents to soften the fibers and render them cohesive. autogenous bonding has been found particularly advantageous from the standpoint of providing fabrics of good strength without incorporating an adhesive having a composition differing froz that of the fibers in the fabric. in autogenous bonding. strength can in some instances be improved and/or cecorafiive sau¯ . oat-erns or modified tactile properties provided by overall or intermittent compression of the softened fibers. however, certain process difficulties have hitherto been associated with autogenous bonding. for example, in processes employing thermal softening of fibers, careful control of temperature (and pressure, if utilized) is required to obtain adequate bonding without complete melting resulting in destruction of the fibrous structure uidlor sticking of-the web,to supports or pressure applying devices. techniques using liquid softening agents must similarly be carefully controlled to prevent total web dissolution. further, many liquid bonding agents and gaseous bonding agents, e.g. hci, are corrosive to equipment and/or pose potential hazards to operating personnel if carelessly handled. the bonding of fibrous webs by the application of specified amounts of water followed by compression of the web to prescribed thicknesses at specified temperatures is described in japanese patent publication nos. 74-3459; 74-3460; and 74-3461. however, attempts to prepare non-vvoven fabrics in accordance with the teachings of the aforesaid japanese publications have yielded materials which failed to satisfactorily withstand conventional usage such as washing. a practical process utilizing water as an agent for bonding organic fibers to form fabrics of acceptable physical properties would represent a substantial advance in the art. 5summary of the invention the process of the invention is one for making nonwoven fabrics, and is characterised by simultaneously compressing and heating a nonwoven web of water bondable organic fibers, said web containing a bonding quantity of water: the compressive force, temperature, and time of exposure of the web thereto being correlated to effect autogenous fiber bonding sufficient to provide a wash-stable fabric but the correlation being such as not to effect autogenous bonding of fibers of an otherwise equivalent dry web sufficiert to provide a wash-stable fabric. a preferred process according to the invention is characterised by providing a bonding quantity of water in a nonwoven web of water
