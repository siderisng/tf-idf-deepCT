<ABSTRACT>
a wovon carpet backing incorporating weft yarns pro­ duced by extruding and stretching a foamed ribbon prod­ uct produced from a thermoplastic polymer composition  comprising polypropylene and a blowing agent.  the yarns  may be subjected to fibrillation and/or heatsetting.  the  carpet backings may be prepared in a conventional manner  and used in tufted or woven carpets.  carpets incorporating  the carpet backings are softer than carpets produced from  carpet backings incorporating conventional polypropylene  weft yarns.

<DESCRIPTION>
woven carpet backings and carpets incorporating same this invention relates to fabrics for use as carpet backings and also to yarns for incorporation therein. carpets have traditionally been made using woven fabric backings incorporating spun natural fibre weft yarns, generally yarns derived from jute or flax. recently, such natural fibre weft yarns have been increasingly replaced by synthetic yarns, as the use of such synthetic yarns is often more economical and also possesses technical advantages. synthetic weft yarns incorporated into woven carpet backings for use in the manufacture of carpets, for example axminster and wilton carpets, should in general give the carpets the following properties: (a) a good weaving efficiency; (b) a good dimensional stability so that, for example, the carpet does not contract in width during the weaving operation; and (c) carpets containing the weft yarns should not contract in width during the drying cycle which normally follows the application of latex to the back of the woven carpet. producing carpets having the first of these properties has proved to be relatively straight-forward by using fibrillated polypropylene weft yarns, and such yarns give good weaving performance in axminster or wilton carpets. however, such polypropylene yarns have a much higher extensibility than the jute yarns which they replace and therefore give an unacceptable carpet width contraction during the weaving operation. another disadvantage of these yarns is their high thermal shrinkage, often exceeding 2% at 130 0c. traditionally, axminster and wilton carpets were finished by back sizing with a conventional starch preparation. this treatment locked the pile into position and did not require the application of large amounts of heat to the back of the carpet during a drying cycle. however, with the substitution of natural fibre yarns in the backings with polypropylene yarns, carpet manufacturers discovered that the count or thickness of the weft yarn could be dramatically reduced due to the superior strength of such yarns. this enabled the weaver to use yarns of a smaller diameter which in turn meant that the backing fabric into which the pile was woven was lighter. these lighter backing fabrics gave a poorer tuft lock and were found to be unacceptable. in order to obviate these disadvantages, the carpets have been back coated with a latex preparation. while such coating stiffened the carpet to a suitable extent and gave excellent tuft lock, it required the carpet to be subjected to a prolonged heating cycle during the drying of the latex. this prolonged heating cycle, for example at temperatures up to about 1300c, required the polyprqpylene weft yarns to exhibit virtually no shrinkage at this temperature. it was found that the extensibility and shrinkage problems in polypropylene weft yarns could be avoided if about 20% polyethylene was added to the polypropylene polymer and the orientated yarns made from this polymer combination were subjected to draw ratios in excess of 20:1. such yarns exhibit extensibilities comparable to jute yarns and shrinkages of less than 1.0% at 1300c. this discovery has led to the acceptance
