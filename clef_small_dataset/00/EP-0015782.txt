<ABSTRACT>
a snap action switch has a q-shaped blade (1) having  two spring arms (3, 4) terminating in outwardly projecting  parallel end portions (7, 8) which are located in a slot (18)  in a contact element (17), these end portions being drawn  together upon insertion into the slot, and thereby stressing  the blade for snap action.  the end portions (7, 8) are reÂ­ tained in the slot (18) by the reaction forces due to the  stressing of the blade, and make good electrical contact  with the contact element.  the blade end portions may be  drawn together by a clip to which a contact is rivetted.  the contact element may alternatively be carried by a  conductive arm separate from the blade and operable by  the latter.
