<ABSTRACT>
a coating method is provided based on the use of a uv  curable mixture of a polyolefin and a polythiol having an  onium salt photoinitiator.  this invention attempts to over­ come the problem of increasing the cure time of elastomeric  products when inhibitors are used in conjunction with photo­ initiators.  liquid polythiol-polyene mixtures can be converted  to elastomeric solids by a condensation polymerisation  method, without the need for an inhibitor, by substituting an  onium salt for a free radical accelerator.  specific photo-­ decomposable cationic photoinitiators are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
coating method and curable compositions the present invention relates to ultraviolet radiation curable compositions having a polyolefin component and a polythiol cout- ponent and an effective amount of a photoinitiator. the present invention also relates to a coating method 'involving the application of the aforementioned curable compositions onto a substrate followed by exposing the treated substrate with ultraviolet radiation. prior to the present invention, photocurable compositions such as kehr et al u.s. patents 3,697,395, 3,697,402 and 3,700,574, etc., showed that curable liquid polyenepolythiol mixtures could be converted to solid elastomeric products. as further discussed by kehr et al in division of organic coatings and plastics chemical, vol. 33, no. 1, of april 8-13, 1973, on page 295, the photocure of such polythiol-polyene system is identified as a free radical cure requiring an inhibitor to improve the shelf life of the composition. a photocuring rate accelerator is employed, such as benzophenone, to effect addition between the polyene component and the polythiol component resulting in the production of an elastomeric coating. although effective results can be achieved with the above-described free-radical initiated curing system of kehr et al, a significant amount of inhibitor must be used to offset premature gellation. experience has shown, however, that the use of inhibitors to improve the shelf life of the curable polythiol-polyene mixture also lengthens the cure time of the mixture. as shown by the above kehr et al. patents, cure times of several minutes to several days are not unusual. the present invention is based on the discovery lhat liquid polythiol-polyene mixtures can be converted to elastomeric solids by a condensation polymerization method. a photocurable mixture is provided which does not require the use of an inhibitor, and which can be cured to a coating having a thickness of up to 20 mils or more. a faster cure can be achieved by substituting an onium salt photoinitiator for the free radical photocuring rate accelerator of the prior art. onium salts, such as triphenylsulfoniumfluoroborate, are capable of releasing a lewis acid catalyst upon exposure to ultraviolet light. included among the preferred onium salts which can be used in the photocurable compositions of the invention, are compounds such as triarylsulfonium hexafluoroarsenate salts. although less effective than the aforedescribed onium salts because of the requirement of the need of a stabilizer, and undesirable side reactions, such as bubbling and discoloration due to nitrogen release, diazonium compounds such as shown by schlesinger u.s. patent 3,703,296, also provide for condensation polymerization based on the release of a lewis acid. there are provided by the present invention, curable compositions comprising, a polyolefin component, a polythiol component, and an effective amount of an ultraviolet radiation photoinitiator of the formula, (1) (y+)3 (mxk)- (k-l) where m is a metal or metalloid, and y is a cation selected from the class consisting of l(r) (rlb q3 b [(r)c (r2)d (r3)e d]+, [(r)f (r4)g (r5)h z]+, and r is a monovalent aromatic organic radical, r1 is a divalent aromatic organic radical, r2 is a monovalent
