<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a set of four stress gauges mounted on said electrical flexural beam connected together in the form of a bridge (9) so that said bridge develops an output voltage (ΔV) function of the intensity. said force applied to the beam when said bridge (9) is powered as possible; a voltage source (10) for supplying said bridge (9); an amplifier (14) connected at the output of said bridge (9); a digital analog converter (16) connected at the output of said amplifier (14), to which a microprocessor (24) is associated with it; and a display member (13) connected at the output of said microprocessor (24), of the Tiné to allow the display of a signal representative of the intensity of said force. In order to eliminate all the annex stabilization and compensation circuits that are required when it is desired to carry out such a quality circuit, an analog-digital converter (16) of the double-ramp type comprising switching means (19, 20 ) controlled by the microprocessor (24) for taking as a reference voltage the supply voltage (10) has been incorporated into the device. Application including weighing.
