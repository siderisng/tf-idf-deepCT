<ABSTRACT>
1.  clamp for a safety line for persons in danger of falling, comprising a clamp housing encircling a substantially vertically extending safety line, and a clamping lever which is movable on the housing to a limited degree about a pivot axis and to which a connecting line is fastened for attachment to the person in danger of falling and which in the event of a fall is able to trigger a clamping of the safety line preventing slipping of the clamp on the safety line, characterised in that the safety line clamp (15) has a further lever (40) triggering a clamping of the safety line, said further lever projecting above the clamp housing (18) adjacent to the safety line, being here displaceable parallel to the safety line, and being coupled to the clamping lever (24) between its pivot axis (30) and the position where it is fastened to the connecting line (13).
