<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus centrifugally separates blood into plasma-­ rich and plasma-poor components the latter being returned to  donor.  a self-balancing centrifuge is used immediately adja­ cent the donor.  the blood pathway is completely disposable  and includes a phlebotomy needle (16) and blood-compatible  tubing connecting to a flexible blood processing bag (50) sup­ ported within a contoured processing chamber between  shoes (74,78) in the centrifuge rotor (94) so that second blood  component travels along a short internal bag dimension to  achieve separation.  blood from the donor is pumped by pump  (36) under control of weight and pressure detectors (32 and  34) to the bag (50) via tubing (41 and 49) and tubing (49) is cut  and sealed.  a displacement chamber (69) provides a fluid ope­ rated diaphragm to express separated first blood component  from the bag (50) through tubing (60) into receiver container  (61) as the centrifuge rotor spins.  expressing fluid is supplied  via tubing (92) from station (93).  piston and cylinder (95) ope­ rates fluid clamp (142).  the centrifuge can then be stopped to  allow return of second blood component to donor via spike  (46′) plugged into an outlet port in the bag (50) when displace­ ment chamber (69) is further operated.  further spike (46) al­ lows the corresponding return of a further plasma-poor frac­ tion to the donor, by pump (38) through spike (46′) after a fur­ ther contribution fed into the bag (50).
