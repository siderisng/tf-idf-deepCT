<ABSTRACT>
double skin, polyurethane foam core building panels are  fabricated in a process wherein polyurethane foam forming  ingredients (20) are applied to a lower one of the two skins  (13), (14) and allowed to rise vertically upwardly into  engagement with the upper skin (14) which has a preformed  pad (19) of continuous filament glass fibres secured to its  inner surface, i. e.  the surface toward which the expanding  polyurethane foam is advancing.
