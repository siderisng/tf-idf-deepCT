<ABSTRACT>
strip electrode welding appts.  has a pair of feed rolls which reform the strip as well as advance it.  the reforming operation provides strength to the electrode so that it does not require external support as it extends from the welding head to the work surface to be clad.  the electrode body is formed into an arc in a plane transverse the longitudinal axis of the strip-clad electrode.  the reforming operation stiffens the relatively thin ribbon of electrode so that its tip supporting the arc to the work surface is steady and reliable in forming the bead that clads the work surface.
