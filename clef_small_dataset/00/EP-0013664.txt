<ABSTRACT>
the device is arranged on a physical training apparatus having a pedal crank gear about the axis thereof (9) actuating a drum (6) braked by a shoe (7).  it comprises a disc (10) driven in synchronisation with the drum (6) and a roller (11) fixed in contact with the surface of said disc (10) and driven rotatingly by said rotary disc (10).  the rotation speed of said roller (11) varies on one hand with the variation of the position of the disc (10), corresponding to a variation of the position of the shoe (7) held by the spring (23), and on the other hand with the variation of the rotation speed of the disc (10) corresponding to a variation of the rotation of the drum (6).  the rotation of said roller (11) is transmitted by means of a cable (14) to a speedometer (13) gratuated in power units.
