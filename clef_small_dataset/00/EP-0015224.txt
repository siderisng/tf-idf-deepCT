<ABSTRACT>
a flat cylindrical carcass band is built on a cylindrical  surface provided by a unique shaping means and abutting  turnup means.  the shaping means has inner and outer walls  the ends of which are juxtaposed solid elastomeric end rings  (82) so as to form an annular envelope (27).  the outer wall has  between its inner and outer layers an arrangement of spring  blades (100) of particular shape formed to control the toroidal  shape of the expanded outer wall to a precisely determined  contour.  the turnup means each include an inner and an outer  bladder (22,73) the edges of each being also juxtaposed solid  elastomeric end rings.  the end rings of each turnup means  are seated with the associated end rings of the shaping means  in a common retaining groove formed in a circumferential set  of radially extendable segments which expand the end rings  and the overlying carcass to conform the carcass initially  about prelocated bead cores.  to conform the carcass about  the bead cores before fully shaping the carcass toroidally, the  shaping means has also a pair of inner bladders (20) each  having a solid elastomeric ring interfitting respectively with  and between the end rings of the mentioned envelope.  these  latter inner bladders cooperate on inflation to roll the carcass  band lying close to the respective beads outwardly and to  compact the bead region, and thereafter the shaping means  envelope is inflated to shape the carcass between the bead  regions and the outer bladder of the turnup means is inflated  to extend the turnup, and optionally, to apply sidewall mater­ ial.  the foregoing abstract is not to be taken as limiting the  invention of this application, and in order to understand the  full nature and extent of the technical disclosure of this appli­ cation, reference must be made to the accompanying drawing  and the following detailed description.
