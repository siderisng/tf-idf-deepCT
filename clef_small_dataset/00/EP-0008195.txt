<ABSTRACT>
in an orthopedic bandage which hardens by means of  a free radical catalyzed polymerization reaction, wherein  said bandage comprises a cast forming composition in­ cluding a solid water soluble vinyl monomer such as diace­ toneacrylamide (daa), n-isopropylacrylamide (n-ipa) or  mixtures thereof, and at least one component of an impro­ ved redox catalyst system capable of initiating the polyme­ rization of such vinyl monomer, said redox catalyst system  comprising a copper containing compound in combination  with a reducing agent, supported on a flexible carrier, the  improvement which comprises increasing the effective  working time of such bandage by providing in said banda­ ge prior to or during polymerization thereof an alkaline  earth metal salt, e. g.  calcium sulfate.  the copper contain­ ing compound may be cupric acetylacetonate.
