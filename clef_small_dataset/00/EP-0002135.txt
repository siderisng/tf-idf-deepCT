<ABSTRACT>
silicon platelets essentially free of iron are precipitated  from a solution of metallurgical grade silicon in molten  aluminium and are melted in contact with silica slag to produce  a refined metallurgical silicon (rms).  multigrained  boules of said rms may be pulled by the czochralski method  on a rotating silicon seed rod from a melt of said rms.   alternatively, the silicon-slag melt can be directionally solidified  to produce a directionally solidified refined metallurgical  silicon (ds/rms) separated from a region of solidified  melt having a high concentration of impurities rejected by  the silicon as it solidifies.  multigrained ds/rms boules may  be pulled from a melt of said ds/rms.  alternatively, the  ds/rms is remelted and directionally solidified a second  time with single crystal ds/rms boules being pulled from  a melt of the twice directionally solidified material.  the  thus-pulled multigrained rms and ds/rms and single  crystal ds/rms materials are low-cost products having a  substantially higher impurity content than in conventional  high purity semiconductor grade silicon while, at the same  time, having desirable solar cell properties.
