<ABSTRACT>
a clamp binder for clamping about a material portion  such as a constricted and portion of bags or of sausage  casings, comprising a u-member (6) for insertion over the  material portion from one side thereof, an apertured cross  member (8) mountable against the opposite side of the  material portion for receiving through its aperture the free  leg ends of the u-member (6) as the material portion is  clamped between the cross member and the base portion  of the u-member, and a wedge member (20) adapted to  be forced into the space between the free leg ends for  bending these outwardly into a locked position in which  the u-member is prevented from retraction from the cross  member, the wedge member being formed of two half-pieces  (20) integrally associated with the respective  free leg ends of the u-member (6) by a breakable connection  (18), such that the half-pieces will be jointed into a  combined wedge member when they are caused to be  displaced towards the locking position, whereby the  wedge will automatically assume its correct position prior  to its being forced into the locking position.
