<ABSTRACT>
a magazine (10) for articles (38), in a stack (40), the articles  (38) to be sequentially removed from a dispensing station (15)  of the magazine (10).  a stack positioning element (45) in the  magazine (10) has an anti-backup member including a pair of  pawls (50, 52) resiliently urged into engagement with  cooperating ratchet teeth (56) on opposed inner wall surfaces  of the magazine (10) to inhibit movement of received articles  (38) away from the magazine's dispensing station (15).  the  magazine (10) is adapted to receive a plunger (42) which  provides the required force to move the stack positioning  element (45) and article stack (40) toward the dispensing staÂ­ tion (15) incrementally as articles (38) are removed therefrom.   it is arranged that pressure from the plunger (42) causes a  reduction in the force of engagement of the paws (50, 52) with  the ratchet teeth (56) in order to minimize the force required of  the plunger (42) to move the element (45) and article stack (40)  toward the dispensing station (15).
