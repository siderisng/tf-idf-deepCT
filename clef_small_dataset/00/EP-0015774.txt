<ABSTRACT>
a wheeled pallet or other carrier having a pair of  spaced wheels (12, 13) mounted on a body (10) and a  respective brake element (26) for each of these wheels.  a  common foot pedal (28) for the brakes is connected with the  brake elements by a rod (29) which extends across the body  and is rotatable about its own axis.  cams formed on oppo­ site end portions of the rod engage respective levers (33)  operating plungers (30) which depress the brake elements.   to enable compensation to be made for variations in the  dimensions of components of the load carrier, each lever  (33) is provided with an adjustable fulcrum (37).  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to a load carrier of the kind comprising a body, a pair of wheels mounted on the body at respective spaced positions, respective brake elements engageable with said wheels for braking rotation thereof, an operating member mounted on the body for movement relative thereto and transmitting means for transmitting force from the operating member to the brake elements or to parts in force-transmitting relation therewith. a wheeled pallet is a common example of a load carrier of the kind referred to. in some known load carriers of this kind, small variations in the dimensions of components result in unsatisfactory operation of the brake elements of certain samples of the load carriers. it is an object of the invention to enable load carriers of the kind referred to having satisfactory braking means to be produced more economically. according to the invention there is provided a load carrier comprising a body, a pair of wheels mounted on the body at respective spaced positions, respective brake elements engageable with said wheels for braking rotation thereof, an operating member mounted on the body for movement relative thereto and transmitting means for transmitting force from the operating member to the brake elements or to parts in force-transmitting relation therewith, characterised in that the transmitting means includes an adjustable lever. in a load carrier in accordance with the invention, the lever can be adjusted to compensate for dimensional differences between load farriers which are nominally identical with each other. the load carriers can be manufactured more cheaply if the dimensional tolerances observed are fairly large. in the accompanying drawings: figure 1 shows a perspective view of one example of load carrier in accordance with the invention; figure 2 shows a plan view of one end portion of the carrier, a load platform being omitted; and figure 3 shows on an enlarged scale a cross-section on the line 3-3 of figure 2. the load carrier illustrated in the accompanying drawings is a wheeled pallet having a body 10 supported on four wheels, three of which are shown at 11, 12 and 13 in figure 1. on the body 10 there is mounted a load platform 14. the load platform and body 10 are rectangular, as viewed in plan and the wheels are positioned near to respective corners of the body. to enable the pallet to be steered, at least the pair of wheels 12 and 13 are incorporated in castors. the construction of the castor incorporating the wheel 13 is illustrated in figure 3. the wheel is rotatably mounted on an axle 15 which extends between a pair of horns, one of which is shown at 16. at- their upper ends, the horns are joined together by a lower bearing plate 17 having a central aperture through which a sleeve 18 extends. above the plate 17, there is an upper bearing plate 19 and a plurality of balls or other rolling elements are interposed between the bearing plates to facilitate relative rotation of the

claims:   1. a load carrier comprising a body, a pair of wheels mounted on the body at respective spaced positions, respective brake elements engageable with said wheels for braking rotation thereof, an operating member mounted on the body for movement relative thereto and transmitting means for transmitting force from the operating member to the brake elements or to parts in force-transmitting relation therewith characterised in that the transmitting means includes an adjustable lever (33).   2. a load carrier according to claim 1 further characterised in that each brake element (26) is integral with or is engaged by a respective plunger (30) which is movable towards and away from a periphery of the associated wheel (13).   3. a load carrier according to claim 1 or claim 2 further characterised in that the lever (33) has a fulcrum which is adjustable relative to the body (10).   4. a load carrier according to claim 2 or claim 3 further characterised in that the transmitting means comprises a pair of adjustable levers (33), one associated with each plunger (30).   5. a load carrier according to claim 4 further characterised in that each plunger (30) is free to turn relative to the associated lever   (33)°    about a longitudinal axis of the plunger.   6. a load carrier according to claim 4 further characterised in that the effective length of each lever (33) is substantially less than the distance between the operating member (28) and the brake element (26) associated with that lever and in that the transmitting  means comprises a further element (29) which   transmits    force between the operating member and the lever.    7. a load carrier according to claim 6 further characterised in that the further element (29) is rotatable by means of the operating member (28).   8. a load carrier according to claim 3 further characterised in that the fulcrum of the lever (33) is provided by a fulcrum element (36) having an end portion which is connected by screw thread means (39) with the body, there is engagement between the lever and the fulcrum element adjacent to the opposite end of the fulcrum element and said engagement restrains movement of the lever in a direction along the length of the lever relative to the fulcrum element.
