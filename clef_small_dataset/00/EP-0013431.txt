<ABSTRACT>
a venturi-type rod scrubber (10) for effecting the cleaning  of the flue gas produced as a by-product of the combustion  process that occurs during the course of the operation of fossil  fuel firing steam generators, before the flue gas flows up the  exhaust stack and is released to the atmosphere.  the subject scrubber includes means (14) through  which the flue gas enters the scrubber (10) and outlet means  (36) through which the flue gas exists from the scrubber (10).  a first spray system (28) is suitably mounted in juxtap­ osed relation to the inlet means (14) so as to be operative to  introduce liquid into the stream of flue gas entering the scrub­ ber (10) through the inlet means (14).  in alignment with but in  spaced relation to the inlet means (14), the scrubber (10) is  provided with a throat region (34) i. e. , a region of restricted  cross-section.  a plurality of spaced rows of parallel rods (40)  are suitably mounted within the throat region (34) so as  extend substantially perpendicular to the path (12) of flow of  the flue gas flowing therethrough.  interposed between the  inlet means (14) and the throat region (34), the scrubber (10) is  further provided with a second spray system (38) that is also  operative to introduce liquid into the flue gas stream.  the first  spray system (28) and the second spray system (38) mutually  cooperate to effect an even distribution of liquid across the  entire cross-sectional area (32) of the throat region (34) that is  being traversed by the flue gas as the latter flows through the  scrubber (10).  this even distribution of liquid provides for an  efficient removal of the particulate matter, entering the scrub­ ber (10) in entrainment with the flue gas.  concomitantly a  reduction is achieved in the amount of particulate emission  being released from the stack to the atmosphere.
