<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for inspecting a defect of a periodic pattern  on an object is provided with a laser device (14) for  projecting a laser beam toward the object.  a mechanism (30)  further included in the defect inspecting apparatus rotates  the object in a plane orthogonal to an optical path of the laser  beam while moving in the same plane.  a spatial band-pass  filter (12) is located at the backward forcal point of a lens (22)  for fourier-transforming the laser beam including the infor­ mation of the periodic pattern and a defect, the laser beam  coming from the object.  the band-pass filter (12) has a  spot-like area for blocking the zero-degree diffraction light  transmitted through the periodic pattern a peripheral light  blocking area for blocking the first and higher-degree  diffracted light beams, and a ring-like light transmission area  permitting the light beam component including the informa­ tion of a defect to pass therethrough, the light transmission  area being located between the spot-like area and the  peripheral area.  a photo-electric converter (28) for picking up  the light beam component including the defect information  transmitted through the filter (12) is located on an image  forming plane where an image of the object is formed by a  lens.
