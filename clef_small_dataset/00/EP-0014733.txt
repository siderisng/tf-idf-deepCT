<ABSTRACT>
the articulated boom-dipper-bucket assembly is utilized  in a tunnel boring machine of the type which includes a hollow  cylindrical body (12) with a front circular cutting edge (14) and  a central axis on which an excavator (30) including the assem足 bly is positioned.  the assembly includes a base (46) having a  front face (48) facing axially of the machine and being  mounted on a bulkhead (40) having siderails which are  received in channels fixed to the body and extending parallel  to the central axis.  a piston and cylinder mechanism is associ足 ated with the bulkhead (40) for reciprocating same in a direc足 tion parallel to the central axis.  the assembly further includes  a boom (52) having one end pivotally mounted to the front  face (48) of the base (46) at one side thereof and a second end  positioned outwardly from the base, an elongate dipper  member (58) pivotally mounted at a first inner end (60) to the  second outer end (62) of the boom, and a bucket-scoop (13)  having an inner edge and an outer cutting edge (64) and being  pivotally mounted to a second outer end of the dipper  member (58).  the assembly also includes a mechanism for  rotating the base on the bulkhead, a first reciprocal power  mechanism (66) pivotally connected at one end to the front  face (48) of the base (46) at the other side thereof and pivotally  connected at the other end to the boom (52) at a point spaced  from the first end thereof, a second reciprocal power mechan足 ism (72) pivotally connected at one end to the first end of the  boom (52) and at the other end to the first end of the dipper  member (58) and a third reciprocal power mechanism (80)  pivotally connected at one end to the first end of the dipper  member (58) and at the other end to the inner edge of the  bucket-scoop.
