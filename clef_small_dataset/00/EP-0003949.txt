<ABSTRACT>
1.  an annularly closed chain comprising eight interconnected equally sized parallelepipeds (1 to 8) comprising pre-notched folded-up cardboard blanks which are rigid by virtue of insertion flap portion (36) and for each parallelepiped at least one adhesive flap portion (26, 27) which is stuck in place, each two successive parallelepiped in the chain being hinged together at a hinge location (14) along equal length side edges (21, 22), and each being hinged to a respective equal-length side edge of adjoining parallelepipeds on both sides in the chain, to form one of two groups of parallelepipeds, at two further hinge locations (11, 12) which are spaced from said side edges (21, 22) and which extend transversely with respect thereto and which are also disposed in symmetrically opposite positions when the parallelepipeds are disposed in succession in a row, wherein the two outermost parallelepipeds (5, 8) of one group are hinged to the corresponding two parallelepipeds (1, 4) of the other group along a respective side edge which is spaced from its hinge location (11 and 12 respectively) and which extends transversely with respect thereto, and the hinge locations (9 to 16) comprise additional wall strip portions (23) of the cardboard material, of a width substantially corresponding to from three to five times the wall thickness thereof, which are connected on both sides to the associated parallelepipeds by way of a respective fold line which also forms the adjacent side edge thereof, characterized in that the additional wall strip portions (23) are interrupted by slots (24) and the connecting flap portions (25) which are formed between the slots are about half the length of the slots (24) in the longitudinal direction of the wall strip portions (23) and are also fo a length which approximately corresponds to fifteen times the thickness of the cardboard materials.
