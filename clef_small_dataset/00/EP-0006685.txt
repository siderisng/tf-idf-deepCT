<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacture of a polyester polyol  which comprises reacting an organic polyol with a lower  alkyl ester of a polycarboxylic acid and removing lower  alkanol from the reaction mixture as it is formed and,  towards the end of the reaction, adding an organic  polyol or a polycarboxylic acid to the reaction mixture  and then continuing the reaction to the desired extent.  the process provides polyester polyols which, having  a minimum number of unreactive end groups, are partiÂ­ cularly useful in polyurethane manufacture.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
this application relates to polymeric materials and ore particularly to a process for the manufacture of polyester polyols. it is knownto make polyester polyols by a transesterification reaction between a polyol such as ethylene glycol and a lower alkyl ester of a polycarboxylic acid, for example a dimethyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid. in the course of the reaction, the lower alkanol, formed by the splitting of the lower alkyl ester, is displaced from the reaction mixture and the polyester of the polyol and the polycarboxylic acid is formed. in order to form a polyester having hydroxyl end-groups, an equivalent excess of polyol is employed relative to the lower alkyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid, the molecular weight of the polyester being controlled by the amount of the excess. towards the end of the reaction when the concentration of reactive species is low, the rate of reaction is low and the final traces of lower alkoxy groups can be difficult to remove even in the presence of conventional transesterification catalysts. for some purposes, the presence of alkylated end groups in the polyester in addition to hydroxyl groups is unimportant but for other purposes, for example where the polyester is to be used as a reactive entity suchasinthe preparation of polyurethanes, it is desirable to replace the residual alkylated end groups by hydroxyl (or carboxyl) groups as completely as possible. the present invention provides a means of maximising the conversion of the residual lower alkoxy residues to hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. thus, according to the invention, there is provided a process for the manufacture of a polyester polyol which comprises reacting an organic polyol with a lower alkyl ester of a polycarboxylic acid and removing lower alkanol from the reaction mixture as it is formed and, towards the end of the reaction, adding an organic polyol or a polycarboxylic acid to the reaction mixture and then continuing the reaction to the desired extent. up to the point where the organic polyol or polycarboxylic acid is added to the reaction mixture, the process of the invention may be carried out in a completely conventional manner. thus, the initial charge of organic polyol and polycarboxylic acid ester is heated in a conventional reactor at temperatures up to a maximum governed by the thermal stability of the reactants and product. suitable maximum temperatures are in the range 200-2500c and the reaction may be assisted by the inclusion of a known transesterification catalyst, for example tetra-n-butyl orthotitanate. it is usual to facilitate the reaction by taking steps to remove the by-product alkanol such as purging with an inert gas, for example nitrogen or carbon dioxide which may be combined with the application of reduced pressure especially towards the end of the reaction. the reaction mixture should be well agitated and it is useful if the agitation results in a fine dispersion of the inert gas stream. when volatile starting materials are used, it is necessary to minimise their loss from the reactor with the alkanol
