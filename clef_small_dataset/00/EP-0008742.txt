<ABSTRACT>
this disc printer uses a relatively massive, rigid print disc  (22) having a flat face on which two sets of raised character  fronts (21,22) are arranged in separate spirals.  advantage­ ously, the inner font set (21) contains machine readable  characters which are printable with high resolution, and a  second font set (22) arranged so that the characters are  upright as they pass a print zone which is vertically offset from  the zone in which the high resolution characters are printed.   the print disc acts as the platen for printing.  with this  arrangement, the same print disc can be used to print charac­ ters onto a record medium (10) at two different elevations,  while maintaining the medium flat, and without the need to  transport the medium vertically.  a check printer also is dis­ closed which uses the print disc to print machine readable,  high resolution characters onto the check (10) during linear  transport of the check in one direction, and to print other  indicia onto the check during linear transport thereof in either  the same or the opposite direction.
