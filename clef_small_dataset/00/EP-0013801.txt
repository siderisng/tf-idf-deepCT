<ABSTRACT>
a number of moving objects and stationary playfield  objects are generated on a video display screen (24) by  sharing memory (16, 40) and circuitry (17, 42, 46) on both  a physical and time-share basis.  video graphics data for  playfield and motion objects is stored in a read-only me­ mory (rom) (40).  an object attribute memory (16), which  may be updated at any time, is scanning during each hori­ zontal retrace interval to provide information used to selec­ tively read moving object video data from the rom (40)  and assemble and store a complete horizontal line of mov­ ing object video graphics data in a separate staging me­ mory (50).  during active scan time of the horizontal video  display line, the assembled line of moving object video  data is accessed from the staging memory (50) and com­ municated to the display screen (24) via appropriate video  circuitry to produce the video of the moving objects.  at the  same time, the object attribute memory (16) is accessed  for playfield object information which, in turn, is used to  address the video graphics rom (40) to produce the ac­ tual video image of playfield objects.  the video image of  playfield objects so obtained is also communicated to the  display screen (24) through the video circuits.
