<DESCRIPTION>
description safety check valve for unit fuel pump-injector technical field this invention relates to a fuel injection apparatus and particularly to unit type fuel pumpinjectors for diesel and other engines. background art many internal.combustion engines, particularly those operating on the diesel cycle, require an apparatus to inject a predetermined amount of fuel into the engine combustion chamber at the proper time in the operating cycle. one device for accomplishing this result is a unit fuel pump-injector which performs the dual functions of injecting fuel into the engine combustion space and metering the amount of fuel to be injected. typically, the fuel injector housing contains a cylindrical bore in which a plunger is reciprocable. clamped to the lower end of the housing is a spacer block which defines a pump cylinder for the plunger. this spacer block contains an annular groove connected to a plurality of passageways which lead to a fuel chamber surrounding a needle valve located in the tip of the fuel injector. in the usual case, low pressure fuel is supplied to the plunger cylinder and on each downward or injection stroke of the plunger, this fuel is forced under high pressure through the passageways and into the fuel chamber located in the injector tip. this high pressure fuel forces the needle valve off its valve seat and uncovers multiple orifices leading to the combustion space. fuel is thus injected from the plunger cylinder to the engine combustion space. when pressure on the fuel in the injector tip fuel chamber is relieved, the needle valve is returned to a closed position by a spring. the upper surface of the spacer block defining the plunger cylinder(chamber)usually includes a check valve in the form of a circular flat disc which prevents combustion gases from entering the plunger cylinder if the needle valve fails to close or closes too slowly. this check valve is necessary since proper engine performance depends upon the proper amount of fuel being injected at the proper point in the engine cycle. combustion gas in the pump cylinder will delay and reduce the amount, or completely prevent the injection of fuel during the succeeding injection cycle because the gas must be forced into the combustion space before fuel may be injected. in addition, if a large amount of gas enters the fuel supply system, sudden and unpredictable power loss and/or engine failure may result. during engine operation, it sometimes hap f pens that the needle valve becomes stuck in the open position or the injector tip becomes damaged or broken off entirely. in the typical system, there is no way to prevent low pressure fuel from leaking from the plunger cylinder into the combustion space when this occurs. consequently, low pressure fuel will be allowed to flow from the plunger cylinder into the combustion space during the upward and dwell portions of the plunger cycle. this constant fuel flow will have seriously adverse effects on engine mechanical condition and performance since it will result in fuel waste,
