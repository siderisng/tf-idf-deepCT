<ABSTRACT>
in a calciner of the type having a screw conveyor for  advancing material to and through a calcining reaction zone,  and wherein the screw conveyor comprises an internally  cooled support shaft 12 which is provided with an outer screw  flight shaft 8, an improved comprising means for controlÂ­ ling the bending stress between the inner and outer shafts is  provided.  further, means are also provided for allowing axial  movement of one of the shafts relative to the other.  the  bending stress ranges between the inner and outer shaft are  controlled by means of a plurality of bearing members (68)  which extend in a generally radial direction with respect to the  shafts and which extend between the shafts.  the bending  stress range is also controlled by the axial position of the  bearing members along the shafts.  axial movement of one  shaft relative to the other is permitted by the provision of  bearing cages 60 around the inner shaft with axial slots 64  formed in the cage.  a portion of the bearing member is  tracked in the slot and can thus slide axially therein.
