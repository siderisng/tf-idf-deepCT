<ABSTRACT>
a system and method are disclosed for analyzing opera­ tion of the ink jet head of an ink jet printer.  initiation of start-up  is sensed, as is the pressure build-up in the ink jet head as ink  is supplied thereto.  the time lapse between initiation of  start-up and the commencement of pressure build-up is  determined, as is the time required for the pressure within the  ink jet head to build to an operational level, and outputs  indicative thereof are utilized for determination of fault  occurrence and indication of faults or initiation of fault correc­ tion in response thereto.  the system includes a pair of coun­ ters 33, 35.  counter 33 is controlled by a start-up initiation  signal via gate 29 and the output of a comparator 39 which  receive a predetermined reference signal 1 and a signal indi­ cative of pressure build-up at the ink jet head.  counter 33 thus  reaches a count indicative of the time taken for the ink pres­ sure to reach the first reference pressure.  counter 35 similarly  provides a count indicative of the time taken for the ink pres­ sure to change from the first to the second reference pressure.   the outputs of counters 33,35 or gated to microprocessor 25  where they are analyzed to determine whether the printer is  operating correctly or whether maintainance or repair is  required.
