<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for forming a battery grid from  stock material having an open network and an unopen por足 tion thereon wherein the unopen portion lies centrally  thereon and the open network portions are of greater thick足 ness than the unopen portion, said open network portions  being provided with nodes.  the grid is formed by continu足 ously advancing the stock material along a predetermined  path, forming spaced apart cut out portions on said unopen  portion and simultaneously working the open network por足 tions to orient and size the same whereby the faces of the  nodes are displaced.  the instant invention also relates to the  battery grid so formed, the grid itself comprising a metal grid  structure defining a header and a lug connecting section (28)  thereon, an open network structure (14) depending from the  header over the entire length thereof, said open network  being provided with nodes (15) having elements projecting  therefrom to define cells, said nodes having a trapezoidal  cross section.
