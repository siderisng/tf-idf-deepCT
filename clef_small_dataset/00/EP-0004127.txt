<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a non-throttling, anti-leak manually  reciprocated, plunger pump for attachment to a consumertype  liquid dispensing container to provide drip-free dispensing  of liquid therefrom.  the pump has a hollow-stemmed  skirted plunger (14) which is reciprocable in a pump chamber  to draw liquid through an inlet into the chamber from a container,  and to discharge it from the chamber to atmosphere  through the hollow stem (32) of the plunger.  a check valve  (54) is positioned in the chamber inlet (50) to allow liquid to  enter but prevent its return flow.  a differential force-actuated  control element (56) is nested in the plunger, for reciprocation  therewith but having capability for axial movement  independently thereof.  the control element includes valve  means (64) for blocking discharge through the plunger stem  and the valve is normally biased to blocking position.  in addition  the control element cooperates with a fitment or body  insert at the inlet end of the pump chamber to provide telescopingly  cooperating cylinder and piston members (58,76)  which are engaged throughout full reciprocal travel of the  plunger and control valve.  the fitment includes separate  passage (82,83) for venting the cylinder/piston combination  to the interior of the container through an aperture (92) in the  wall of the pump housing, and for communicating the pump  chamber with the fluid inlet and dip tube of the pump housing.
