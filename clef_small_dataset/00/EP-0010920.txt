<ABSTRACT>
in a liquid phase epitaxial process for producing mag­ netic garnet crystals, primary melt residues adhering to a  magnetic garnet crystal (4) are removed by immersing the  crystal (2, 4) subsequent to growth in a rinse melt at or  near the growth temperature of the primary melt.  the rinse  melt has a saturation to nucleation temperature range  overlapping that of the primary melt and encompassing its  growth temperature, has a solvent different from that of the  primary melt and saturated or super-saturated with respect  to the primary melt's solute, and has no undesirable adhe­ sion properties of its own.  the rinse melt enables residues of bismuth containing  melts to be removed.  bismuth containing primary  melts are used to improve the properties of garnet crystal  structures (2, 4, 6, 8) used for magneto-optic light deflec­ tors.
