<DESCRIPTION>
"process and intermediates for preparing 11-(alkoxy-and alkylmercapto-3-oxoalkyl)-2,6-methano-3-benzazocinest' description this invention relates to a novel process for preparing 3-r1-7-, 8-, 9- or 10-hydroxy-11(ax)-r3-6(eq)-r4-11- (eq)-[ch2ch2co(ch2)n-x-alk]-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-2,6-methano- 3-benzazocines having the formula: emi1.1 where r1 is hydrogen, lower-alkyl, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl, phenyl-lower-alkyl, lower-alkenyl or lower-alkynyl; three of r2, r2', r2" and r2"' are hydrogen and the fourth is hydroxy; r3 and r4 are each hydrogen or lower-alkyl, or r3 and r4 together are divalent lower-alkylene, - ich2)z, where m is one of the integers 3 and 4; n is one of the integers 2-4; x is oxygen or sulfur (-o- or -s-); and alk is lower-alkyl, and is an improvement in the process described in belgian patent 864,950. as used herein, the term lower-alkyl means saturated, acyclic groups which may be straight or branched containing from one to about seven carbon atoms as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl or heptyl. as used herein, the terms lower-alkenyl and lower alkynyl mean monovalent groups of from three to seven carbon atoms containing one double or triple bond as illustrated for example, by 2-propenyl, 2-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 3-methyl 2-butenyl, 1-methyl-2-propenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, 2-propynyl, 2-butynyl, 4-pentynyl, 2-hexynyl and the like. as used herein, the term cycloalkyl means saturated carbocyclic groups containing from three to seven ring carbon atoms as illustrated, for example, by cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 2-methylcyclobutyl, 4-ethylcyclohexyl and the like. according to the' process of the present invention, the compounds of formula i are prepared by heating, in an acid medium, for example with formic acid either alone or in an organic solvent, for example toluene, xylene or mesitylene, at a temperature from 100-150 c., or with a benzyldi-lower-alkylammonium formate or a tri-lower-alkylammonium formate at a temperature from 120-1500c., a lower-alkyl 1 r1-3-[alk-x(ch2)n-co]-4a&alpha;-r3-5&alpha;-r4-6-, 7-, 8- or 9-methoxy methoxy-1,2,3,4,4a,5,10,10a-octahydro-2,5-methanobenzo -oc quinoline-3-carboxylate having the formula: emi2.1 where three of r2, r21, r2" and r2''' are hydrogen and the fourth is methoxymethoxy; r1, r3, r4, n, x and alk have the meanings given above; and alk' is lower-alkyl. under the acid conditions present during the heating of the compounds of formula ii in formic acid or formate solution, the compounds of formula i where one of r2, r2', r211 and r2.' " is hydroxy are produced from the compounds of formula ii where the corresponding group is m2thdymeflxey (ch3och2o) by simultaneous ring opening of the compounds of formula ii between the 2- and 3-carbon atoms, decarbalkoxylation of the resulting 2,6-methano-3-benzazocine moiety and cleavage of the methoxymethoxy group. the above-described process for the preparation of the compounds of formula i via the compounds of formula ii represents a substantial improvement over the known process for preparing the compounds of formula i described in belgian patent 864,950, because the present process combines in one step, i.e. the ring opening/decarbalkoxylation and simultaneous ether cleavage, the conversion of the compounds of formula ii to the compounds of formula i, whereas according to the known process, compounds corresponding to formula ii where three of r2, r2', r2", and r21'' are hydrogen and the fourth is lower-alkoxy
