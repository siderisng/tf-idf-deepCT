<ABSTRACT>
1.  clamping device for a rest member (3) which is mounted in the back rest (1) of a seat or chair so as to be continuously adjustable, in particular for the head rest of a dentistry patient's chair, comprising a support post (2) for the rest member (3) which post is displaceable in a frame (4) of the back rest (1), and comprising at least one clamping member (6, 6a) engaging by frictional force with the support post and so maintaining the latter in each adjustment position and which contains a plurality of spring elements (11) which contact a surface of the support post (2) with a bias force and along which the support post (2) slides during displacement, where the bias force of the elements (11) is selected to be such that on the one hand the support post (2) is automatically fixed, safeguarded from displacement, in each adjusted position of the rest member (3) and on the other hand can be displaced whenever an external force acting in the direction of displacement (arrow 5) is applied, characterised in that, resiliently flexible tongues (11) in the form of saw-tooth like projections are arranged on an elongate-base body (12) arranged fixed in the frame (4).
