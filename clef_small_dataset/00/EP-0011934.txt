<ABSTRACT>
an output circuit for a body stimulator, such as an  implantable cardiac pacemaker, has output terminals 13, 14  and an output capacitor 17.  control inputs on terminals 50, 55  control the amplitude of the output pulse; if an input is pro足 vided to either terminal 50 or 55 transistor 32 connects  charged capacitor 17 to ground making terminal 13 negative.   a 'single' signal at terminal 55 causes terminal 14 to be at  ground potential through the action of transistors 56, 34, 32,  30, and 27.  a 'double' signal at terminal 50 causes terminal 14  to be connected to v + via transistors 33 and 26 giving sub足 stantially twice the output voltage.  capacitor 17 charges through resistors 48 and 25 or more  rapidly through shunting transistors 45 and 23 when a  'recharge' signal is supplied to terminal 20.  a 'single' or 'double' signal results in switch 67, 70 turning  on and then off after the signals and charging of capacitor 64.   during discharge of capacitor 64 transistor 62 blocks transis足 tors 51 and 56 to prevent a stimulating pulse for a predeter足 mined period to provide a rate limit.  a rate limit output is  provided to digital circuitry at terminal 60 and a low input at  this point may override the rate limit function.

<DESCRIPTION>
body stimulator body implantable cardiac stimulators or pacemakers are known to the prior art. an early pacemaker is disclosed by greatbatch in u.s. patent no. 3,057,356, entitled "ed- ical cardiac pacemaker#, which issued in 1962. this device included a relaxation oscillator that generated electrical pulses at a fixed rate. the pulses were applied to the heart to cause the heart to contract each time a pulse occurred. pacing technology has lagged behind conventional state of the art electronic technology in its utilization of digital electronic circuits. one reason for this has been the high energy required to operate digital electronic circuits. energy requirements are a major concern in pacemaker design. however, with the continuing advances of electronic technology, digital electronic circuits are increasingly feasible within the context of cojwrtercial pacemaker units. the accuracy and reliability of digital electron ic circuits are factors that encourage their use within the pacemaker context. the facility with which they can be programmed and reprogrammed to alter one or more operating parameters further enhances their utility. for example, pacemakers have been disclosed which respond to magnetic and/or radio frequency signals to alter an operating parameter. pulse rate and pulse width may be programmed in this manner. in addition, pacemakers have been constructed which are inhibited in the presence of certain signals, al though no known prior art pacenaker is capable of having more than two parameters, features or tests programmed on command. the the implementation of digital electronic circuitry within the pacemaker context provides the opportunity to program or reprogram one or several operating parameters, on command, via externally generated signals. for example, pulse rate, pulse width and pulse amplitude can be externally established at one of any number of combinations. in addition, the refractory period may be established and altered. further, digital circuitry can be programmed on a temporary or permanent basis, as desired. of course, other operating parameters or characteristics can also be externally programmable. clearly then, a pacemaker utilizing digital electronic circuitry would have a more universal application by .allowing the pacemaker to be programmed to fit the needs of a particular application as opposed to being manufactured for limited applications. in addition, such a unit can be instructed to give an external indication of its program status, particularly in instances where that status is not directly observable. however, even with the implementation of digital circuitry, certain analog circuitry is necessary to generate and/or transmit various control signals and to respond to the digital circuitry to effect its programming. the present invention relates to analog circuitry intended for cooperation with digital circuitry to assist in the performance of the @@nction. among the analog circuit functions necessary within the context of a digital pacemaker are the demodulation of a programming signal, the detection of heart activity during operation in a demand mode and provision of clock pulses. additionally, analog circuitry may be employed to give an indication of battery status and to impose an upper rate limit on the stimulation initiating signals generated
