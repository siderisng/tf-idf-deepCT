<ABSTRACT>
Amino acid fractions of different compositions are obtained by fractional filtration to different times after neutralizing the hydrolyzates. In the neutralization of a protein hydrolyzate crystallizy ren the difficult soluble amino acids with different speeds. The first fraction that fails immediately after neutralization is enriched at leucine, and the later fractions after crystallization times of at least 3 days are enriched to tyrosine and cystine. To obtain L-tyrosine, the tyrosine-rich fraction is dissolved at a pH of 10-11, filtered and the tyrosine precipitated at a pH of 8.5 - 10. This solution is set to a pH of 3.0 - 6.0 and the precipitated cystine is separated. The leucine rich fraction is dissolved in acid, by addition of oxidizing agents the methionine oxidized and a raw leucine precipitates at a pH of 1.0 - 2.0 with the content of isolucine in the solution preferably to 1.0 - 1.5% is set. To extract leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, a saline saturated solution of the hydrochlorides of these amino acids is extracted with a water-immiscible alcohol. By washing the alcohol extract with water, the proportion of valine and tyrosine can be further reduced. For the separation of phenylalanine and tyrosine, a neutral solution, the hydrochlorides of these amino acids are supported by a weakly basic and over a strongly basified anion exchanger. By eluting the strongly basic anion exchanger with a hydrochloric acid solution, the phenylalanine and the tyrosine can be removed from the ion exchanger. The eluate is concentrated, the hydrochloric acid content sets to 20-5%, sodium chloride separated at 70-90 ° C, and the pheny lalanine hydrochloride crystallized by cooling.
