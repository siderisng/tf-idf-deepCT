<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a process and apparatus for drying wet  solid material.  the process comprises introducing wet solid  material into a dryer bringing the material into contact with  one side of a plurality of heated surfaces located in the dryer  and vaporizing liquid contained in the wet solid material.  the  vaporized liquid is withdrawn from the dryer and compressed  to a pressure greater than the pressure in the dryer and then  returned to the other side of the plurality of heated surfaces  where, upon condensation, the latent heat energy is released  therefrom and is used to vaporize liquid contained in wet solid  material on the opposite side of the heated surfaces and  withdrawing the condensate from the heated surfaces and  substantially dried solids from the dryer.  the drying apparatus provided comprises a housing (11)  having entrance (13) and exit (15) openings and means (17,19)  for delivering material to be dried into and dried material from  the housing located in the opening and closing and isolating  the interior of the dryer from the outside atmosphere.  a plural­ ity of hollow heat exchange means (25,27) are disposed in the  interior or the dryer housing and are connected to an external  heat source (55) and to the atmosphere.  in addition, compres­ sor means (57) are connected to the housing in the vicinity of  the entrance opening (13) and to the hollow heat exchange  means, the compressor means operating at positive pressure  with respect to the pressure in the housing so that vaporized  liquid is withdrawn from the housing or compressed and then  led to the hollow heat exchange means (25,27) where it is  condensed, giving up its latent heat energy and thus vaporiz­ ing the liquid in wet solid material on the opposite surfaces of  the hollow heat exchange means.
