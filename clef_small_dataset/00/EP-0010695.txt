<ABSTRACT>
when machine elements (1) having a large mass shall  be indexed, i. e.  subjected to short, quick rotating move­ ments, very great acceleration and deceleration forces  must be transmitted via the driving means of the machine.   due to vibrations occurring, increasing the stresses on the  driving means, this must be dimensioned accordingly.  the  present invention suggests a method and an arrangement  for the compensation of the forces supplied and thus re­ ducing the stresses occurred.  this is performed by com­ bining the indexing machine (1) element with a cam disc  (6) which is affected by a number of spring-loaded (13)  cam followers (9, 10), whereby the cam disc (6) has such  a shape that the cam follower (9, 10) decelerate and acce­ lerate the cam disc (6) following the desired movement  pattern of the machine element (1).
