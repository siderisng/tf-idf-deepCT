<ABSTRACT>
the impact resistance of rigid polymeric resins (e. g.   pvc, san, pmma, etc. ,) is enhanced by the incorporation  therein of an improved toughener.  this toughener comprises  three distinct phases: (a) a core of thermoplastic or thermoset  resin having a tg below room temperature, (b) a  rubberlike layer overpolymerized on the core, and (c) a  relatively hard polymer overpolymerized on the rubber  layer.  the utilization of a "soft" core, or seed, apparently  enhances the efficiency of the toughener in the  rigid polymer.  in one of the preferred embodiments of this  invention, the improved toughener comprises a seed derived  from a partially crosslinked poly(n-butylacrylate), a  rubber-like (or intermediate) layer derived from a monomer  mixture containing n-butylacrylate and an addition monomer  and an outer layer (or shell) derived from a monomer  mixture containing styrene and methylmethacrylate.
