<DESCRIPTION>
novel (l-arylcycloalkylmethyl) isothiocyanates a process for preparing them, and compositions comprising them background of the invention: in brit. pat. no. 892,790 and in u.s. pat no. 3,367,957 there are described respectively the compounds methyl isothiocyanate and cyclopropylmethyl isothiocyanate both as nematocides. the present invention relates to a novel class of biocidal (l-arylcycloalkylmethyl) isothiocyanates- which differ from the aforementioned cyclopropylmethyl isothiocyanate by the presence of an aryl radical in the l-position of the cycloalkane ring. description of the preferred embodiments: this invention is concerned with novel (l-arylcycloalkylmethyl) isothiocyanates which may structurally be represented by the formula (i) emi1.1 wherein ar s a a mews per selected from the group consisting of t'!ie:n1 nalothienyl, naphthalenyl, pyridinyl, phenyl and substituter phenyl, said substituted phenyl having from 1 to 3 substituents, each independently selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkyloxy, lower alkylthio, halo, amino, nitro, cyano and trifluoromethyl; and n is an integer of from 2 to 5 inclusive. in the foregoing and in the following definitions, the term "halo" is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo; the term "lower alkyl" is meant to include straight and branched hydrocarbon radicals, having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, l-methylethyl, 1,1-dimethylethyl and the like. the' compounds of formula (i) may be prepared by the application of methodologies known in the art, as described, for example, in saul patai ed. "the chemistry of cyanates and their thioderivatives" john wiley & sons chichester new york-brisbane-toronto (1977) p. 1013-1053. one meted of preparing the compounds (i) is by the reaction of the amine (ii) with carbon disulfide (iii) to obtain a dithid- carbamate of formula (iv) and subsequently converting the latter into the desired isothiocyanate (i) by the reaction of (iv) with an appropriate decomposing anent, e.g. a lower alkyl chloroformate (v), preferably ethyl chloroformate. the foregoing reactions are illustrated as follows: emi2.1 emi3.1 said reaction of the amine (ii) with carbon disulfide (iii) is conveniently carried out in an appropriate reaction inert solvent such as, for example, water; a lower alcohols e.g. methanol; an alifatic-, alicyclic- or aromatic hydru- carbon, e.g. hexane, cyclohexane or benzene; a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. trichloromethane; an alifatic- or alicyclic ether, e.g. l,l'-oxybispropane or 1,4-dioxane; and the like the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an appropriate base such as, for example, an alkaline- or an earth alkaline metal hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide; a tertiary amine, e.g. n,n-diethylethanamine and the like. preferably the reaction-temperature is kept below room temperature and, most preferably between 0 c and 10 c. the decomposition-reaction of the dithiocarbamate iv) by its reaction with the lower alkyl chloroformate (v) is suitably conducted in an appropriate reaction-inert solvent e.g. one of the solvents described hereabove for the reaction of (ii) with (iii). bases such as alkaline metal- or earth alkaline metal hydroxide, e.g. potassium hydroxide, or tertiary amines, e.g. n,n-diethylethanamine are taught to have a catalytic effect on the decomposition of the intermediately formed
