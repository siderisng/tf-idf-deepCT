<ABSTRACT>
a system for sorting non-ferromagnetic metals from a  mixture of fragmented material containing such metals and  rubber and plastics material comprises a linear motor 20  situated immediately underneath the belt 22 of a conveyor  along which the fragmented material is passed at a  predetermined speed.  the linear motor is mounted so as to  have at least a component of traveling field at right angles to  the direction of flow of the conveyor and the frequency and  power of operation of the linear motor is selected to cause at  least a selected portion of the non-ferromagnetic metal to be  propelled from the belt in a direction substantially at right  angles to the direction of flow of the conveyor.  a number of  linear motors 124, 126 may be used to select different portions  of the non-ferromagnetic material by choice of frequency and  power of operation.  the selected portions may be different  metals.
