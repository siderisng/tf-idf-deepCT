<ABSTRACT>
this invention comprises new compounds as well as a  composition and method for influencing, in particular for  inhibiting plant growth, which composition contains as active  ingredient a quaternary pyrrolidinium acetic acid anilide of  the formula    wherein x- ○represents the anion of any non-phytotoxic acid.  methods for manufacturing the bromide of this com­ pound are described and its use for inhibiting the growth of  plants, in particular ornamentals.

<DESCRIPTION>
composition and method for influencing plant growth the present invention concerns a further development of t invention described in de-offenlegungsschrift 2 657 728 and belgium patent 849 723 and also filed in many other european and oversea countries, claiming the swiss priority date of december 23, 1975, and the present invention provides compositions for regulating, in particular for inhibiting plant growth which contain as active components quaternary salts of pyrrolidiniur acetic acid anilides and a method of regulating plant growth which comprises the use of these active compounds and compositions which contain them. the invention also provides novel quaternary salts of pyrrolidinium acetic acid anilides and a process for their manufacture. a substantial number of quaternary aminoacetic anilides and pyridinioacetic anilides which possess pharmaceutical, disinfectant and bactericidal-fungicizal action etc. are known from the literature, but no particulars are provided relating to any positive and inhibiting action of these compounds with regard to plant growth. from the extensive literature, attention is drawn here only to a number of references,such as "nature" 216, 1331-33 (1967), 223, 748 (1969); europ. j. pharmacology 13, 46 (1970); dos 2 351 942; british patent specification 688 604; journ. hterocycl. chem., 8, 1079 (1971); gazz. chim. ital. 95, 1237 (1965); tetrahedron letters 1969, 4945 etc. certain quaternary aminoacetic anilides have already been suggested for different technical purposes, for example as moth repellents (us patent specification 2 343 071 and german reichspatent 905 373 etc.). none of these publications contains the remotest allusion to or indication of a plant growth-influencing action of such known compounds. on the other hand, quaternary ammonium compounds having another structure are on the market as plant regulators and are described in detail for example in r. wegler's "chemie der pflanzenschutz- und schädlingsbekämpfungs- mittel", vol. 2, springer verlag, 1970, pp. 323-326 and 407, with reference to the original literature. further quaternary ammonium compounds with a plant growth-regulating action have become known for example from ann.appl. biol. 63, 211 (1969); from us patent specification 3 701 799, 3 580 716, 3 856 850 and 3 895 933, and from the journ.agr. and food chem. 7, 264 (1959) and 16, 523 (1968). however, all these prior at growth-regulators are not quaternary ammonioalkanoic acid anilides, but are to some extent very complicated organic compounds the present invention is base on the surprising observation that quaternary salts of pyrrolidinium acetic acid anilides of the formula i wherein emi3.1 x represents the anion of any non-phytotoxic acid hx, possess outstanding plant growth-regulating properties in mono- and especially dicotyledonous plants, and can be used for example as growth inhibitors for grasses, cereals, soya beans, ornamentals, fruit etc., and also have some abscission effect on fruit and leaves. the anion x can be selected from any of the nonphytotoxic acids and has no appreciable influence on the biological action. x is for instance chlorine, bromine or iodine. according to the present invention, the novel salts of the formula i are obtained by methods which are known per se by reacting 3-chloro-aniline
