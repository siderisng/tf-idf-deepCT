<ABSTRACT>
process and apparatus (see figure 2) are provided for  stimulating immune resistance by the introduction of at  least one relatively small solid non-toxic substantially non-biodegradable  body (22), having nonspecific antigenic  action, into each gland cistern of the udder.  the body is  sufficiently flexible or elastic and of a shape so as to be  capable of being shaped into a form small enough to be  inserted into the gland cistern through the lactiferous duct  and then reformed to its original shape which inhibits its  passage from the gland cistern into the teat cistern.  the  continued presence of the non-specific antigenic body  induces immune resistance including an increase in the  number and activity of phagocytic cells, particularly leukocyte  cells, in the udder.  the continued presence of these increased numbers  of activated phagocytic cells provides protection against  bacterial invasion through the streak canal without degrading  milk quality.
