<ABSTRACT>
a stackable armchair (1) has two arm rest (8, 9), each  of which has a downwardly opening trough (23, 24).  one  trough is preferably slightly smaller than the other.  this  arrangement permits adjacent armchairs in a row to be  linked together with the trough (23) of one arm rest (8)  being retained within the trough (24) of the adjacent arm  rest (9) of the adjacent armchair.  the invention overcomes  the prior art problem that hitherto armchairs have not been  able to be stacked.  the armchairs of the preferred embodiment  are injection moulded from polypropylene and able  to be linked together to form a row.
