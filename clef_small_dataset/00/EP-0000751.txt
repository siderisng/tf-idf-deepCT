<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing a chromium oxide support catalyst for olefin polymerization from a catalyst precursor - which in turn is a chromium compound homogeneously loaded on silicon dioxide-based small-scale carrier - wherein (1) the catalyst precursor - optionally with the addition of a promoter - in The heat treated with an oxygen-containing gas, and then (2) can be used to act on the product obtained from step (1) carbon monoxide. The specifics of the method is that in the stages (1) and (2) respectively, the solid is present in the form of a fluidized bed, which is maintained by a carrier gas stream, with the masses that (1) - in step (1 ) Oxygen treatment at a temperature of 400 to 1500 ° C, via a period of at least 30 minutes, and (2) - in step (2) the carbon monoxide treatment at a temperature of 250 to 500 ° C, over one Time span of 0.5 to 3 hours is carried out by an anhydrous and oxygen-free gas consisting of nitrogen, which is evenly distributed over the total time of carbon monoxide treatment, a total of 100 to 1000 moles. % - Related to the chromium trioxide content of the product-carbon monoxide obtained from step (1) are added.
