<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a digital display exerciser (50)  which increases the test and maintenance capability of the  computer input/output interface (30) coupling a procesÂ­ sor/display unit (22, 24) to a computer (40).  the interface  includes a memory (32) for storing therein data from data  sources (ds) in response to display addresses generated by  a processor (22).  when there is some test or maintenance  operation to be desired or any time the plant is down not  using computer, the display exerciser is connected between  the output of the interface and the input of the processor,  while the data sources and the computer are disconnected  from the processor/display unit.  the display exerciser can  recirculate data stored in the memory to the processor to  provide a visual display of the contents of the memory in  order to permit checking of the operational integrity of the  interface.  the display exerciser can also introduce new  "simulated" data to the memory to aid in training of control  room operators.

<DESCRIPTION>
digital display exerciser this invention relates to a digital display exerciser for increasing the test and maintenance capability of a display unit-to-computer interface wherein the dats in ina memory in the interface is recirculated as simulated data from the interface output to the input of the display unit for display to enable checking of the operational integrity of the interface. in complex and sophisticated data acquisition and control systems, such as that associated with a nuclear power plant, data from numerous discrete locations within a facility is typically multiplexed through a data interface and processing unit for ultimate access and storage by a central data processing and control initiating computer. the requirement for operator awareness of the status of operating conditions within the facility necessitates the inclusion of a control room installation whereby an operator can monitor the facility conditions represented by the data being transmitted from the remote facility locations to the central computer. in the conventional arrangement, as shown in figure 1, the processor/display unit 20 processes and displays data reccived from the data sources 1)s of the remote data locations herein illustrated as consisting cf data cabinets, a, x, ...t;, and provides the processed data for access by a central computer 40. the remote data locations, as represented by data cabinets a, b, etc. can represent any of numerous sources of data information with the data sources ds being groups of control rods within the containment c of a nuclear power plant. the processor/ display unit 20 functions as a data correlator and local display of processed data. parallel multiplexing is used to obtain data from the data cabinets a, b, etc. the processing section of the unit 20 generates a sequence of addresses corresponding to the data sources ds and sequentially processes the data for display purposes. raw data from the data cabinets is also fed to a random access memory in a display unit-to-computer interface 32 (figure 2) for storage. the central computer 40 accesses the random access memory on a non-synchronous or random basis, i.e., the computer requests data corresponding to a computer address which is independent of the display address generated by the processor/display unit 20 to access the data cabinets. the processor/display unit 20 responds to the address request from the central computer 40 and initiates a data search in its memory within a specifically allocated time period. in the event that the processor/display unit 20 is not operating properly, there will be a certain manifestation of a malfunction of the unit on the display screen. however, a problem arises where the display unit-to-computer interface 32 fails. there is no way of knowing the operational behavior of the interface except for the computer. it is desired to provide the test capability of the display unit-to-computer interface. it is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a novel digital display exerciser for a data acquisition and display system with a view to overcoming the deficiencies of the prior art. the invention resides
