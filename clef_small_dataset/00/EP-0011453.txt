<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a railway wagon suspension  unit of the type comprising a frame (1) mounted over a sad­ dle (2) accommodating an axle journal housing (3) with a  load spring suspension system (6) disposed between the  frame and the saddle.  the saddle bears on the housing  through a mounting which includes a rubber block (17)  together with the conventional rib (19) and channel (20)  structure, the rubber permitting a controlled degree of  movement between the saddle and the housing principally  restricted to longitudinal motion in the direction of travel of  the wagon, in which rubber yields to shear stress, and lateral  motion by which the saddle pivots on the mounting about  the housing.  the principal advantage of the introduction of  this mounting is that the axle is permitted to self steer into  tight curves at low speed whilst retaining satisfactory high  speed performance.  hitherto, the wedges have tended to  accommodate longitudinal motion on curves only in a com­ paratively disjointed fashion by somewhat 'stepwise' slip­ ping and this has been particularly marked at low speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
railway wagon suspension units this invention relates to railway wagon suspension units; such units may be used separately in conjunction with each wheel of a single axle two-wheel assembly, i.e. a pedestal, or embodied in side frames in a composite bogie structure, e.g. a four-wheel two axle or six-wheel three axle bogie. it is known to provide a railway wagon suspension unit comprising a frame mounted over a saddle accommodating an axle-journal housing, with a load spring suspension system disposed between the frame and the saddle, the saddle bearing on the housing through a mounting adaptor including a curvilinear surface engaging a further surface whereby to permit pivotal lateral motion of the saddle and the housing relative to one another. such a unit is the subject of uk patent no. 1433948. with such an arrangement longitudinal motion between the axle-journal housing and the saddle, principally manifested when negotiating curves, has tended to be accommodated in a comparatively disjointed somewhat stepwise fashion by movement of the customary wedges in the suspension system, adversely affecting the ride, particularly at slow speeds, and promoting wear. the present invention mitigates this drawback by providing in the mounting a body of elastomeric material. with this arranbemcnt there is penlitted a controlled degree of movement particularly in respect of the longitudinal @otion of the kind referred to where the elastomer now yields to shear stress, additionally, lateral pivotal mover lot of the kind by which the saddle pivots or swings about the housing mounting adaptor is accommodated whilst direct lateral translational movement of the saddle relative to the adaptor is restrained. now particularly, as distinct from more conventional pedestal designs hitherto, there is a larger degree of clearance for longitudinal movement between the axle-journal housing/adaptor and the saddle walls so as to accommodate such movement when the elastomeric body is subjected to shear stress. with this invention, such longitudinal movement which, as mentioned, is principally manifested when negotiating curves, is wholly accommodated by the elastomer up to a load rate equal to that at which the friction on. the wedges inthe load spring suspension system is overcome. the principal advantage of the introduction of this elastomeric mounting is that the axle is permitted to self steer into tight curves at low speed whilst retaining satisfactory high speed performance; this enables a higher mileage to be obtained between tyre turning, i.e. re-furbishing worn tyres on the wheels. in order that the invention, may be fully understood some embodiments thereof wirl nnw be described with reference to the accompa @ @@@@@@@@ w@@@n, figure 1 is a part sectional side elevation of a pedestal unit in accordance with this invention. figure 2 is a part sectional end elevation through the wheel axle. figure 3 is one modified form of elastomeric mounting, and figure 4 is another modified form of mounting. referring now to figures 1 and 2 in the drawings there is shown a railway wagon pedestal unit comprising a frame 1 mounted over a saddle 2 accommodating an
