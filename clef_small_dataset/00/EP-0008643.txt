<ABSTRACT>
The tip of the present invention, applicable mainly to optical cables, essentially comprises a body (16) provided with two cylindrical recesses (18) and (20), a socket (24) consisting of a thermorled material tractable and a sleeve (26) consisting of a heat dying material.To fix the tip on the cable (10), the sleeve (24) and the sleeve (26) is introduced into the ease (18), then the stripped end (12) of the cable is introduced untilthat the sheath (14) comes to stop against the edge of the socket (24).Then we heal the assembly, which causes the contraction of the socket (24) until it comes to override the conductor (12) and push the material (26) into the space between the conductor (12)and the walls of the recess (20).
