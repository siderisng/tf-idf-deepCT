<ABSTRACT>
a connector providing the joining, without stripping, of electrical conductor cables, and tools for crimping such a connector onto cables.  the tool comprising two shapes or jaws, either each made up of two inclined planes, or having corresponding undulations which engage during crimping, crimps the connector, comprising a tube (1), on the inside lateral surface of which is disposed a rasp (2) whose barbs (3) are identical, for holding onto the conductors (12 and 13) received in the tube (1), so that barbs (3) of the rasp (2) traverse the sheaths and penetrate into the cores of the conductors (12 and 13) in the central part (14) of the tube (1), where the barbs (3) are most closely spaced, whilst the barbs (3) penetrate into the sheaths at the ends (15 and 16) of the tube (1), where the barbs (3) are least closely spaced, the gradual penetration of the barbs (3) into the cables (12 and 17) being ensured by the shape of the jaws of the tool.  <image>
