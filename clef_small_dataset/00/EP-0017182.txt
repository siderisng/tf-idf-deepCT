<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus are disclosed for forming a  relatively porous patty (40) of plastic food material (38) that is  subject to shrinkage during cooking.  one embodiment of the  apparatus includes a foraminous member (640) having a  plurality of apertures (642) and a piston (630) slidably  disposed on a receiving chamber (610) on one side of the  foreminous member (640).  a pressurizable feed chamber  (54) is provided with a feed mechanism (70, 72) for feeding  and pressurizing the food material (38) and forcing the  material (38) through the apertures (642) and into the  receiving chamber (610).  a mold (119) is provided for being  aligned with the foraminous member (640) and for receiving  the material (38) as it is discharged from the receiving  chamber (610) by movement of the piston (630).  the  discharging material impinges upon a wall (52) of the mold  to form a patty (40) in which the material defines interstitial  voids (310) therein for entrapping air and providing retention  of cooking juices to promote more rapid and uniform  cooking of the patty.
