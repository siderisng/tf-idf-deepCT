<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a load-supporting frame.  a frame (10, 11, 12) has load-supporting means e. g.  in the  form of filaments (13) stretched between opposite frame sides  (10, 11) and a variable tensioning device comprising a spinal  column of links (15) secured to one end of the filaments (13)  and connected to the adjacent frame side (11) by springs (16)  and by a variable tension coupling comprising a carriage (17)  slidable along the flexible column of links (15), a slider (23)  slidable along the frame side (11), a screw connection (21, 24)  connecting the slider (23) to the carriage (17) and operable to  vary the tension in the filaments adjacent thereto.  the frame  can provide variable-position lumbar support in the back rest  of a vehicle seat.
