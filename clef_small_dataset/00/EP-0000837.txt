<ABSTRACT>
a load beaming wall panel and method of manufacture  thereof, the panel comprising a non-load bearing core and a  layer of load bearing fibrous concrete material (33) located on  each face, each layer being substantially impervious to moisture,  and the thickness of each layer is less than the thickness  of the core.  a method of forming said panel comprising spreading a  layer of fibrous concrete onto a base of a mould, laying blocks  of the core material onto the exposed surface of the fibrous  concrete and forcing said blocks into intimate contact with  said fibrous concrete until it has set, applying a second layer  of fibrous concrete between and over the blocks and allowing  it to set.  the base of the mould may be flexible to take on a curved  configuration to form curved panels.
