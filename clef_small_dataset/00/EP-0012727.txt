<ABSTRACT>
the barrier of this invention is formed by barrier sec­ tions and each of them can be wound up about a reel or  bobbin, which is pivotably mounted within a main floating  hollow element, which not only has the task of receiving,  transporting, towing, launching and trawling the barrier  section housed therein, but also it serves to provide anchor­ ing points for this barrier.  each main barrier element is  shaped in the form of a cage-like container provided with at  least a side vertical entrance passage, through which a  barrier section can be returned inside the container, or this  section can be caused to come out, each main floating  element thus serving as floating container for the transport  of at least one of the barrier sections to or from their use  place.
