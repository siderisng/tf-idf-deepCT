<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power supply device for a superconductive, short-to-switch magnetic coil with a separator per coil end, which contains a stationary, cooled contact part and a movable contact part connected to a power supply device and a mechanical actuating device for joining the contact parts. However, when joining the heated contact part to the cooled contact part, there are relatively large amounts of thermal quantities to be transferred to the cooled contact part and thus to the superconducting coil end connected to it and evoke NOR mall line there. The invention therefore provides that the mass ratio of cooled contact part (3) to movable contact part (22) is at least 5: 1, preferably at least 10: 1. and that the cooled contact part (3) at its end facing away from the contact region (5) (FIG. 10) provided with means for surface enlargement such as cooling banners (11, 12) and connected to the coil end (16) and a heat resistance between the contact region (5) and the coil end (16) per 1000 A to be transmitted to at least 0.2 K / W, preferably at least 0.5 k / w has.
