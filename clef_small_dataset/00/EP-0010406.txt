<ABSTRACT>
polyimide fibers, which have a porous, microcellular  structure, are the reaction product of a diester of a ben­ zophenonetetracarboxylic acid and at least two diamines.   one diamine is heterocyclic acid and has nitrogen in the ring,  and another diamine is a para- or meta-substituted aromatic  diamine free of aliphatic moieties.  a method of making such  fibers is also described.  that apparatus for making the fibers includes a foaming  chamber (10) into which the particulate polyimide precursor is  fed as from a hopper (12).  chamber (10) is maintained at a  temperature in the range of 100-200°c.  an inert atmosphere is  preferably maintained in chamber (10).  the precursor begins to melt and foam in chamber (10),  producing a semi-molten mass which is transferred to a con­ ventional spinning disk (18) which forms the melt into fibers  (20).  the latter are discharged into a heated polymerization  chamber (22).
