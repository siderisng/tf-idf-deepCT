<DESCRIPTION>
the invention relates to a process of copolymerizing ethylene with one or more higher α-olefin monomers employing high activity mg and ti containing complex catalysts in a low pressure gas phase fluid bed process to produce polymers having a density of ≧ 0.91 to ≦ 0.96 g/cm³ and a melt flow ratio of ≧ 22 to ≧ 32. until recently, low density (≦ 0.940 g/cm³) polyethylene has been produced commercially, for the most part, by the high pressure ≧ 1050 bar (≧ 10,000 psi) homopolymerization of ethylene in the gas phase in stirred and elongated tubular reactors in the absence of solvents using free radical initiators. on a world wide basis, the amount of low density polyethylene produced in this fashion, annually, amounts to more than about 6.10⁶ billion kg. as recently disclosed in us-a-4 011 382 and in be-a-839 380 it has been found that low density polyethylene can be produced commercially at pressures of < 69 bar (< 1000 psi) in a gas phase reaction in the absence of solvents by employing selected chromium and titanium (and, optionally, fluorine) containing catalysts under specific operating conditions in a fluid bed process. the products produced by the processes of us-a-4 011 382 and be-a-839 380, however, have a relatively broad molecular weight distribution (mw/mn) of ≧ 6 to ≦ 20. as such, although readily useful for a large number of applications in the areas of wire and cable insulation and molded pipe, they are not broadly useful in the area of injection molding applications. they are also not broadly used in the area of film applications because of the poor optical and mechanical properties of films made from such resins. to be commercially useful in a gas phase process, such as the fluid bed processes of us-a-3 709 853, 4 003 712 and 4 011 382 and ca-a-991 798 and be-a-839 380, the catalyst employed must be a high activity catalyst, that is, it must have a level of productivity of ≧ 50,000, and preferably ≧ 100,000 kg of polymer per kg or primary metal in the catalyst. this is so because such gas phase processes usually do not employ any catalyst residue removing procedures. thus, the catalyst residue in the polymer must be so small that it can be left in the polymer without causing any undue problems in the hands of the resin fabricator and/or ultimate consumer. where a high activity catalyst is successfully used in such fluid bed processes, the primary metal content of the resin is of the order of ≦ 20 parts per million (ppm) at a productivity level of ≧ 50,000 and of the order of ≦ 10 ppm at a productivity level of 100,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal, and of the order of ≦ 3 ppm at a productivity level of ≧ 300,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal. low catalyst residue contents are also important where the catalyst is made with chlorine containing materials such as
