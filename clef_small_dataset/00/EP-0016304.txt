<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a choke (10) for controlÂ­ ling the flow of mud in drilling an oil well.  the choke (10)  comprises a hollow valve body (12) having a passage and an  internal valve seat (56) surrounding an axial passage (82) past  the tapered face (62) for directing mud flow past the tapered  face within the valve body.  an encircling valve seat shoulder  (64) lies in a plane perpendicular to the flow through the axial  passage.  a valve element (48) is provided within the body and  has an external tapered face (90) conforming to the tapered  face (62) of the valve seat such that upon movement of the  valve element (48) within the body (12), the valve face moves  into a concentric throttling position with relation to the valve  seat to throttle the flow of mud through the valve seat.  the  valve element (48) is provided further with a surrounding  shoulder (92) to seat against the valve seat shoulder (64) to  close off the flow of mud.

<DESCRIPTION>
choke for controlling the flow of drilling mud in the drilling -of an oil well, the drilling lubricant is called drilling mud. it picks up cuttings from the bottom of the well and carries them to the top of the well and then to a mud pit where the chips or cuttings are separated. this permits the mud to be reycled-and used again. the fluid flow system involving the mud is a high pressure system; acondingly, it is necessary to control this flow system with a choke. chokes, however, run into great difficulties in that the mud and the cuttings carried by it are very abrasive. because they are abrasive, they rapidly destroy the valve and seat mechanism in the choke. in one form, the choke of the present device is an elongate tubular housing having in one end a closure or plug which entraps a fluid operated piston. the piston is made double- acting by applying pressure to both faces controllably. the piston has a centralized plug appended to it which receives thereabout a valve member formed of an an extremely hard material. it is located in a circular chamber which communicates with a lateral port where the mud flow from the well is introduced. the lateral port is directed at the valve element which is able to withstand the wear of the flow. the apparatus further includes a circular valve seat which is inserted downstream. the valve seat is also made of hardened material and has a tapered leading edge. it has an edge which matches or mates with the valve element, itself. as the two are brought together, they close off the passage through the choke. the valve seat is a hollow circular ring which communicates with an outlet passage. an alternate embodiment offers an adjustably positioned, tapered plug cooperating with a tapered seat, both of the members being formed of a hardened material. it has the feature of fitting the taperedplug into the tapered seat without contact against the sidewalls. moreover, the throttling surface is not the surface that provides actual closure in the event that the valve is fully closed. one advantage of the second embodiment is thus the ability of the apparatus to provide continual throttling to mud flow with surfaces which are never required to contact one another. this prevents closure of these surfaces against one another with the- consequential damage that occurs should particulate cuttings be trapped between them. they close toward one another to achieve the throttling so attractive in the present invention, but they do not contact. moreover, these surfaces are concentric to one another so that, at a given spacing or throttling position, the flows controlled even though the plug serving as a valve may be partly worn away. erosion of the components must be excessive and substantially total before it actually modifies the gap: or spacing through the throttling flow controller. fig. 1 is a sectional view taken through adiaiteter of the choke assembly of the present invention

claims:   1. a choke for controlling the flow of mud which comprises:  (a) a hollow valve body having a passage therethrough;  (b) a valve seat having an encircling, tapered face surrounding an axial passage past said tapered face for directing mud flow past said tapered face within said valve body;  (c) an encircling valve seat shoulder lying in-a plane perpendicular to the flow through said axial passage; ;  (d) a valve-element having an external tapered face conforming to said valve seat tapered face which, on movement, moves into a concentric, centrally   positioned    throttling location within said valve seat tapered face and which valve element and valve seat tapered faces define a gap therebetween for throttling mud flow passing through the gap, and wherein said element controllably   blocks the    axial passage flow of mud past said valve seat on movement of said valve element toward said-valve   seat; ;     (e) a surrounding shoulder on said valve element which shoulder is adapted to conform to and   seat-against    said valve seat shoulder to plug and close the flow of mud through the gap between said valve element and said valve seat, said shoulder further moving toward said valve seat shoulder for closure;  (f) means for moving said valve element into a fully closed position relative to said valve seat; and    (g) inlet and outlet means communicating with said passage through said valve body.   2. the apparatus of claim 1 wherein said valve element comprises a tapered plug having an end portion extendable into said valve seat with a conic sidewall incorporating said tapered face, said plug further including a radially outwardly protruding enlargement supporting said valve element shoulder facing said valve seat shoulder.   3. the apparatus of claim 2 wherein said valve seat comprises a removable and replaceable sleeve insertable into said hollow valve body and which valve seat incorporates said encircling tapered face interiorally of an axial passage through said valve seat.   4. the apparatus of claim 2 wherein said plug supported enlargement overhangs said valve seat to bring said valve element shoulder and said valve seat shoulder into contact in a plane approximately perpendicular to a centerline axis of said plug.   5. the apparatus of claim 4 including a piston rod connected to said plug and a cooperative piston and cylinder connected to said piston rod for moving said piston rod and said plug together.   6. the apparatus of claim 5 including inlet and outlet ports arranged in said cylinder to enable fluid actuated movement of said piston in said cylinder.    7. the apparatus of claim 1 including a mounting means connected to said moving means and also connected to said valve element, said mounting means including a lock means which lock means secures said valve element to said moving means.     8. the apparatus of claim 7 wherein said mounting means threads to and unthreads from said moving means and wherein said lock means secures said mounting means against unthreading.   9. the apparatus of claim 8 wherein said lock means comprises a ring around said mounting means secured thereto by cooperative key and key slot means and which further includes wrench connective means to enable a tool to be engaged therewith for rotating said ring and said mounting means as a unit to thread said mounting means to said moving means.
