<ABSTRACT>
1.  concrete formwork with at least two shuttering panels consisting of a main frame with crossbeams (14) and a plate member (11) carried by the main frame, there being connecting elements for the neighbouring shuttering panels which each have a displaceable sectional beam (26) which is clampable, via a first keyed connection, with the main frame of the one shuttering panel, and via a second keyed connection of the same kind, with the main frame of the neighbouring shuttering panel on the side facing away from the plate member (11) and wherein the keyed connections automatically align the shuttering panels while drawing them together, characterized in that, each keyed connection has a carriage (30, 30a) displaceable on the sectional beam (26) and embracing the sectional beam and a wedge plate (18, 18a) secured to the main frame so that the wedge plate does not project the main frame at its rear side opposite to the plate member (1) with the inwardly disposed wedge surface (20) of the wedge plate cooperating with an overlapping tapered surface (34, 34a) of the carriage (30, 30a).
