<ABSTRACT>
an improved container and safety stopper combination  of the type which includes a container (10), a stopper (12)  hingedly connected to the lip (16) of the container, and a pin  (26) slidably mounted in a slide channel (24) formed in the  stopper and having an enlarged outer portion (40) adapted to  engage a recess (28) in the lip (16) of the container to lock the  stopper in its closed position.  means are provided to prevent  the pin (26) from sliding outwardly or inwardly unless  manually pulled or pushed respectively.  when the stopper  (12) is closed and the pin (26) is fully inserted, the upper side  of the enlarged outer portion (40) of the pin is spaced from  the stopper the minimum distance sufficient to allow the  fingernail of an adult user to fit within a laterally extending  groove (42) in the enlarged outer portion (40) so that the pin  (26) can be pulled outwardly.  also disclosed is a safety cap  including a stopper seat (70) which can be permanently  attached to the lip of a container for liquids, a stopper (72)  hingedly connected to the stopper seat, and a pin (74)  slidably mounted in a channel (102) formed in the stopper.   when the stopper is closed, a plug (96) extending from the  stopper seals the passage (86) extending through a spout  (80) which projects upwardly from the stopper seat.  thereafter,  when the pin (74) is fully inserted, a flange (84) on the  spout engages the pin and prevents the stopper from being  swung to its open position.
