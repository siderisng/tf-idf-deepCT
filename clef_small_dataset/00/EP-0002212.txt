<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a frameless holder for images and the like, which from a support plate (2) with at least three pins (18) with heads (19), a cover plate (5) and clamps (1) releasable with the pins (18) or insoluble connected and cover plate (5), image (4) and support plate (2) comprising comprehensive paragraph parts (3) consists. Each clip (1) is designed such that it consists of two portions (7, 8) against each other by a substantially vertical step (6) against each other, wherein both sections (7, 8) together form a resilient sheet which by means of his Rounded end edges (12, 14) on the back of the support plate (2) is supported. In this case, the sheet is formed on one side only by part of the relevant portion (8) whose other part continues into the claw member (3). In the longitudinal axis of the clip (1) a slot (11) is designed such that the shaft of the pin (18) can slide in this slot (11). With appropriate choice of dimensions of the length of the pin (18), the diameter of its head (19), the clear height (H) of the sheet formed by the clip (1), the height of the step (6) and the length of the slot ( 11) is formed by pin (18), clip (1) and the edge of the image holder a lockable holding device which allows a simple assembly and disassembly of the image holder by moving the clip (1) under light pressure on the elastic sheet.
