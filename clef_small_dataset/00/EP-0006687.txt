<ABSTRACT>
a method of improving fuel utilisation and reducing  noxious exhaust emissions in an internal combustion  engine having a carburettor (22′) for feeding a fuel/air  mixture to a mixture inlet tract (23′), said method com­ prising admitting to the inlet tract, to be carried to the  combustion chamber(s) of the engine after mixing with  the fuel air mixture, a flow of hydrogen (8) and a catalyst  (9′, 14′) for the combustion, the catalyst being a catalytic  metal as such or as compound in particulate form or as  a solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
i. c. engine improvements the invention relates to improvements in, and in the operation of, internal combustion engines running on hydrocarbon fuels. the object of the invention te to provide a means to reduce the noxious products of ctistion in the exhaust gas and to increase the overall efficiency of the engine by improving combustion, thus reducing fuel consumption it is known that, in present day motor car engines and other internal combustion engines, a good part of the fuel fed into the induction passages and combustion chamber is not fully burned. this is due partly to inefficient atomisation and vaporisation of the fuel before it enters the combustion chamber and partly to the mixture of air/fuel not being constant under different running condition on account of the heavy nature of the fuels and other limitations, complete vaporisation of the fuel is not achieved in present day carburettors. the invention provides a method of improving fuel utilisation, and reducing noxious exhaust emissions, in an internal combustion engine having a carburettor for feeding a fuel/air mixture to a mixture inlet tract1 said method comprising admitting to the inlet tract, to be carried to the engine after mixing with the fuel/air mixture, a flow of hydrogen and a catalyst for the combusstion, the catalyst being a catalytic metal as such or as a compound in particulate form or as a solution. provision may also be made for admitting and directing at least one stream of a heated gas (air, recirculated exhaust gas or a mixture thereof) to the mixture inlet tract to impinge upon and mix turbulently with the flow of fuel/air mixture to vaporize fuel droplets therein, and in any event the hydrogen and catalyst or the catalyst alone may be carried in a stream of a carrier gas, heated or not. the invention provides further an internal combustion engine having a carburettor for feeding fuel/air mixture to a mixture inlet, in which engine the mixture inlet has means for feeding said hydrogen and catalyst and, where used, carrier gas and/or extra, heated gas streams to the mixture inlet and thence into the combustion chamber or chambers of the engine. use of catalysts in solution, with extra, heated air or other gas streams is the subject of my earlier u.k. patent no. 1 431 893 to which reference may be made for further discussion. the hydrogen may be fed from a separate source, but is conveniently generated in situ by reaction of steam with a suitable metal, in particular iron as filings or in other suitable, divided form. conveniently the hydrogen is generated in and the catalyst fed from a single unit from which the hydrogen and catalyst pass together via a passageway to the mixture inlet together with any flow of carrier gas. a solid or other catalyst may for example be entrained in a flow of gas to such a passageway, which may conveniently be provided in a carburettor to inlet manifold gasket, without need for any other special
