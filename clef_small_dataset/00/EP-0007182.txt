<ABSTRACT>
novel α-aminoacetamides are powerful stabilizers for  organic materials subject to oxygen and heat degradation,  and particularly for synthetic natural rubber and synthetic  ester lubricants.  a wide range of substituents on the amine  and amide n atoms, and also on the saturated carbon atoms,  yields an array of stabilizers having a wide range of compati­ bility in compositions comprising various synthetic resinous  compounds to be stabilized.  novel synthesis is provided utilizing at least one amine  nucleophilic agent, a dichlorocarbene ion generating agent,  and an alkoxide ion generating agent, which together in the  presence of aqueous alkali and an onium salt, yield novel  α-aminoacetamides in which a wide choice of substituents  may be introduced.  the nucleophilic agent may be a primary  or secondary amine, or one of each.  the dichlorocarbene ion  generating agent is haloform.  the alkoxide ion generating  agent may be a ketone, an aldehyde, or a cyanohydrin which  reacts with the haloform.  an α-trihalomethyl alcohol also  reacts with the amine nucleophilic agent, without the benefit  of a dichlorocarbene ion generating agent.  when the alkoxide  ion generating agent is an α-trihalomethyl alcohol, an  α-hydrogen may optionally be substituted.
