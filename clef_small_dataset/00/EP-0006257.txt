<ABSTRACT>
a skeleton construction for a prefabricated building  comprising corner posts, intermediate posts and trusses  composed of various profiles which are connected to one  another by means of various joints wherein the corner  post is formed by a box-shaped profile (1), to which over  part of its length, on the outward sides an l-profile (2) is  fastened and on the inwardly extending rim a further l-Â­ profile (3) is connected, said l-profiles being shorter than  the box-shaped profile (1), whereas on the lower side of  the box-shaped profile u-profiles (4) are fastedned.

<DESCRIPTION>
skeleton construction for a prefabricated building. the invention relates to a skeleton construction for a prefabricated building comprising corner posts, intermediate posts and trusses formed by various profiles fastened to one another by means of different joints. the invention has for its object to provide a skeleton construction which can be simply and readily mounted during the erection of the building, because the various prefabricated parts fit to one another and can be fastened in and on one another. the various prefabricated parts have dimensions such that they can be transported in conventional containers so that costs are saved. the construction is, moreover, such that the cross-sections of the channel-section profiles employed have the same dimensions so that roof and/or wall plates of the same thickness can be used. according to the invention the corner post is formed by a box shaped profile to which over part of its length is fastened an l-profile on the outer sides, whilst a further l-profile is arranged on the inwardly extending rim so that the l-profiles are shorter than the box-shaped profile, to the lower side of which are fastened u-profiles. the intermediate post is formed by a box-shaped profile to which over part of its length u-profiles are fastened on two opposite sides, said u-profiles being shorter than the box-shaped profile, whereas the lower side of the box-shaped profile has fastened to it u-profiles. the trusses are composed by two halves to be slipped one into the other and to be secured to one another and are equipped with means for placing and fixing on the corner and/or intermediate posts. the invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing. figure 1 is a front view of a corner post and figure 2 is a sectional view taken on the line il-il in figure 1, figure 3 is a front view of an intermediate post and figure 4 is a sectional view taken on the line iv-iv in figure 3. figure 5 illustrates on a reduced scale the structure of the truss. figure 6 finally shows part of the truss construction with the fastening area of the truss on an intermediate post. figure 7 shows in elevation a building according to the invention. the corner post (figures 1 and 2) comprises the box-shaped profile 1, to which over part of its length, on the outer sides, an l-profile 2 is fastened, whereas the gprofile 3 is mounted on the inwardly extending rim. the two l-profiles 2 and 3 are shorter than the box-shaped profile 1. the free portion of the box-shaped profile 1 has fastened to it on the lower side the u-profiles 4. these profiles are provided, if necessary, at their free ends with strips 5, which can be slipped into and fixed in joining u-profiles of other posts so that a stable connection and a correct alignment are ensured. the holes 6 serve to pass bolts to be inserted into the foundation. the intermediate post (figures 3 and
