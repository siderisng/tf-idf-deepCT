<ABSTRACT>
a low cost tubular solenoid is formed with a drawn  case (20) in which the pole portion (22) forming the base  of the solenoid is an integral part of the case.  a coil bobbin  (25) is formed by the injection molding of plastics material  and is provided with an integral wall (30) which is posi­ tioned in abutting relation with the inside surface of the  pole portion, thereby forming a stop surface for the sole­ noid plunger and effectively spacing the plunger from the  base.  the plunger is guided on the internal surfaces of the  bobbin (25) and a spun hollow sheet metal bushing (40)  is captured by the inwardly turned end (45) of the case in  telescopic relation with the bobbin, and is formed with  threads (46) which receive a sheet metal retaining nut (48).   terminal leads are attached to the bobbin and extend  through apertures formed in a bobbin extension (36) eli­ minating the need for the placement of coil lead-in wires.
