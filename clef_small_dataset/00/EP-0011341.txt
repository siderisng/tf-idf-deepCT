<ABSTRACT>
This system comprises an encoder in which the different MIC signal to be transmitted is formed as the difference between the incoming linear signal and a prediction signal provided by a prediction filter comprising a local decoder receiving said different MIC signal. According to the invention, the local decoder and the remote decoder have the same structure constituted by one or more cascading filtering cells, each filtering cell being of a purely recursive or non-recursive type with a single coefficient different from zero and being provided. From its own rounding device (or truncation) with a pass equal to the quantization step of the different MIC signal, the incoming linear MIC signal being rounded (or truncated) in the same way. This structure allows cascading mounting of condos and decoders without further degradation of the signal than that produced by the first coding. Application: signal transmission in telephone networks.
