<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector housing for mounting on a  substrate within a relatively wide range of thicknesses, has at  least one boss (4) for receipt in an associated hole (103)  within a relatively wide range of diameters, in the substrate  (100), thereby mechanically to secure the housing (1) to the  substrate (100), the boss (4) comprising a semi-cylindrical  portion (5) extending axially from a surface of the housing (1)  and a laterally extending fin portion (6) formed integrally  with the semi-cylindrical portion (5) and having a first surface  (7) contiguous with the curved surface (8) of the semi-Â­ cylindrical portion (5), and a second surface (9) extending  from the planar surface (10) of the semi-cylindrical portion  (5), the first and second surfaces (7 and 9) meeting to define  an outer edge (11) for the fin portion (6).
