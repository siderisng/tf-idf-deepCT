<ABSTRACT>
the current in a controlled device such as a light emitting  diode (led) 10, driven by a transistor switch q₁, is stabilized  by a current control circuit including a comparator type feed-back  network q₃, q₄, q₅, q₆, which stabilizes the voltage at a  node 11 located between said switch q₁ and the series connection  of a ballast resistor r and led 10.
