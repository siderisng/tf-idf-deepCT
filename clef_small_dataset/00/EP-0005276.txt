<ABSTRACT>
an improved process for producing monoaryl thyrofulgent compounds in which a salt of arylamine is reacted with ammonium rhodanide or an alkaline ethanide in aqueous medium; The process improvement is that the reaction is carried out in a reaction mixture, the output contains a higher amount of weight on the salt of the arylamine than to water and has the amount of 1 to 1.25 times equivalent amount of the rhodanide, based on the arylamine, further No excess acid comprises, and that the reaction is carried out at a temperature which lies at least 5 Â° C below the boiling point of the reaction mixture. Advantageous, but not forcing, the reaction can be carried out using 5 to 10 mol% of hydrogen sulfite ions to intercept sulfur-containing by-products resulting from the acidic complexion of the rhodanide in unavoidable side reaction. With the improved new method, a uniform monoaryl thyrofulgence is achieved in high yield with reduced wastewater load.
