<ABSTRACT>
structurally defined continuous metal strips are formed  by forcing molten metal (2) onto the surface (1) of a moving  chill body (7) under pressure through a slotted (10) nozzle lo足 cated in close proximity to the surface of the chill body.  the  surface (1) of the chill body (chill surface) whereon casting of  the strips takes place has a contoured surface, i. e.  it is pro足 vided with structurally defined protuberances and/or indenta足 tions, which are faithfully replicated by the formed strip, the  thickness of the strip being substantially uniform throughout,  regardless of whether it replicates a level area of the chill sur足 face or a raised or indented area.
