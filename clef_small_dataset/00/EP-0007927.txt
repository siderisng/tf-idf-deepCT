<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for cutting a string of sausage links at a  junction between links into lengths of one or more links,  comprises a conveying means (32) for advancing the  string of links, a stretching means (41) for stretching the  junction to be cut and a cutting means provided between  the conveying and stretching means to cut the string at the  junction (86).  the conveying means (32) pinches and con­ veys the string of sausage links.  the stretching means (41)  is disposed downstream of the conveying means (32) and  pinches and receives the string from the conveying means.   and is coupled to the conveying means for operation there­ with at a greater advancing speed to stretch the junction  between the links.  the cutting means is connected to an  electric eye (73) which detects the junction and operates  the cutting means.
