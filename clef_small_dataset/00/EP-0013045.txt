<ABSTRACT>
On a downstream of the evaporator (15) downstream separator (20), a water outlet line (50) is connected connected to the feedwater vessel (1). In what seraustrittleitung is a heat exchanger (6) and a first control valve (52) is attached, which is influenced by the level in the separator (2). In the heat exchanger (6) heat is transmitted from the water from the separator to the steamwater flowing to the steam generator. between the heat exchanger (6) and the first control valve (52) branches from the water outlet line (50) an equilibrium (55) with a second control valve (56), which is also influenced by the level in the separator (20). The ancillary (55) opens into a capacitor (35). By branching the side line (55) Currently half of the first control valve (52), a large part of the separator (20) leaving water via the coil (55) Sum capacitor (35) is dissipated when starting. As a result, the flow cross-section of the first control valve (52) and the cross section of the safety blow device which can be provided on the feedwase serration can be significantly reduced.
