<ABSTRACT>
a kit for making o-rings (194) from cord material (23)  essentially includes a cord cutting fixture (12) for securing  the material (23), a container (20) of bonding liquid (58) and a  heating mould (14).  the cord cutting fixture (12) allows the  cord material (23) to be cut obliquely in such a fashion that  the inclination of the free ends (60 and 62) is greater for cord  materials (23) of smaller diameter to provide a relatively  larger bonding surface for smaller diameter materials (23).   the heating mould (14) includes two separable heat conductive  blocks (70 and 64) having a common flat interface (68).   apertures (74) extend across the interface (68) and have  cross-sectional diameters that are slightly less than the cord  material cross-sectional diameters.  the central axis of each  aperture (74) is not located directly at the interface (68), and  each aperture preferable comprises two channels (66 and 72)  respectively having cross-sections in the shape of major and  minor segments of a circle.  with this structure, it is possible  to mate the two free ends (60 and 62) of the o-ring (194) in  the heating mould (14) where they will stay relatively  immobile until locked in position by a locking screw (82).  a  heating control unit (16) is associated with a heater element  (88) in the heating mould (14).  the kit can be employed to  create custom sized o-rings (194) in a relatively short period  of time.
