<ABSTRACT>
a simulcast transmission system is provided  where a reference signal transmitted from a central station is  utilized to phase-lock transmitters located at remote stations.   each of the remote stations includes a receiver (102), a signal  conditioner (104) and a transmitter (106, 110) for receiving  and conditioning the reference signal and transmitting the  conditioned reference signal.  each of the remote-station  transmitters includes a phase-locked loop (106) which may  be followed by a transmitter (110) for providing transmitter  signals of predetermined frequencies.  all the transmitters at  the remote stations are phase-locked to the reference signal  from the central station.  the signal conditioner (104, 105)  includes circuitry which enables the signal conditioner  to detect interruption in the reference signal from the  central station, which detected interruptions cause it to  operate in an open-loop mode to provide the conditioned  reference signal during the interruption.  the signal conditioner  (104, 105) also includes circuitry which  enables the signal conditioner to detect clearance of the  interruption and automatically phase synchronize the remote  station to the reference signal for resuming closed-loop  operation.
