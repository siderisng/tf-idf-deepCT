<ABSTRACT>
a cold sheet metal forming apparatus has pairs of upper  and lower forming rolls (2, 3) through which the sheet metal  is passed in succession.  the forming rolls have end bearings  (11) mounted in respective upper and lower bearing housings  (12) mounted on a common frame (7).  the two housings  are secured to the frame by a pair of screw threaded rods (13)  extending through vertically aligned apertures in the housings,  the lower ends of the rods extending into the frame and  receiving nuts (14) for holding the rods in the frame and  further nuts (14) being screwed on to the rods to hold the  lower housing on the frame and the upper housing in place  on the rods.  such an arrangement leaves additional room between  adjacent pairs of rolls and a second set of rollers are nested  between the first set also with the simplified support  arrangement at each end of each roll so as to allow a second  rolling line to be kept in position and available for prompt  use without as has hitherto been the case the necessity to  change rollers.
