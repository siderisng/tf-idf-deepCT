<ABSTRACT>
a lock has a runner (17) whose movement under turning  of a correct key in the lock, is at right angles to that of the bolt  (1).  the runner (17) is coupled to the bolt (1) by a bell-crank  (23) that engages via a peg (29) with a dogleg slot (31) of the  bolt (1).  a shoulder (37) of the runner (17) bears on the casing  rear-wall (38) and lies immediately behind the bolt (1) for  deadlocking it.  upward movement of the runner (17) under  clockwise turning of the key is lost to the bolt (1) initially as  the peg (29) traverses a first portion (32) of the slot (31),  allowing the shoulder (37) to move clear before withdrawal  of the bolt (1).  anti-clockwise turning of the key returns the  runner (17), the peg (29) entering the lost-motion slot-portion  (32) again after the bolt (1) is re-extended, to allow reinÂ­ troduction of the shoulder (37) behind the bolt (1).  the lower  end of the slot (31) is enlarged to ensure that forcing of the  bolt (1) is borne by the shoulder (37) alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
locks this invention relates to locks of the kind in which linear movement of a slide or runner that is coupled to the bolt of the lock is communicated via the coupling to extend or withdraw the bolt according to the direction of runner movement. locks of the above kind in which the runner is mounted to slide parallel to the path of the bolt, are known. such locks are commonly key operated, necessitating the insertion and turning of a correct key within the lock to bring about the movement of the runner required to extend or withdraw the bolt. the runner normally engages with a tail extending from the head of the bolt so as to draw the bolt along with the runner as the runner moves along its linear path, the bolt being thereby extended or withdrawn according to the sense in which the key is turned. the use of a runner in the above way, enables a flexibility in construction and overall dimensioning to be achieved in lock design, as well as, possibly, increased security. but in general it is not readily possible to reduce the depth of the lock in this way. such depth, measured parallel to the path of movement of the bolt, is dependent on the length and throw of the bolt required, and also on whatever additional space is necessary to accommodate the parallel moving runner and its coupling to the bolt. reduction in lock depth is desirable especially in view of the presentday tendency to provide doors and casements with narrower stiles than previously. it is one of the objects of the present invention to provide a form of lock that may be utilized to enable significant reduction in lock-depth and other advantages to be achieved. according to the present invention a lock in which linear movement of a slide or runner that is coupled to the bolt of the lock is communicated via the coupling to extend or withdraw the bolt according to the direction of runner movement, is characterised in that the line of movement of the runner is transverse to that of the bolt. the line of movement of the runner is preferably at right angles to that of the bolt. it may be arranged that a part carried with the runner is moved into the withdrawal-path of the bolt under movement of the runner in the direction for extending the bolt, so as to block withdrawal of the bolt while it is extended and until the runner is first moved in the opposite, withdrawal direction; this is of especial advantage for deadlocking the bolt and securing it against forcing. coupling between the runner and bolt may provide for lost motion between them such that movement of the runner in the direction for withdrawal of the bolt is communicated to the bolt only after the runner has moved sufficiently to clear the said part from the withdrawal-path of the bolt. such coupling furthermore, may enable the final movement of

   calms:      1. a lock in which linear movement of a slide or runner that is coupled to the bolt of the lock is communicated via the coupling to extend or withdraw the bolt according to the direction of runner movement, characterised in that the line of movement of the runner (17) is transverse to that of the bolt (1).   2. a lock according to claim 1 further characterised in that the line of movement of the runner (17) is at right angles to that of the bolt (1).   3. a lock according to claim 1 or claim 2 further characterised in that the runner (17) is coupled to the bolt (1) by a bell-crank coupling   (23).      4. a lock according to claim 3 further characterised in that the bell-crank coupling (23) engages with a slot (31) or groove on the bolt (1) for transmitting runner movement to the bolt (1).   5. a lock according to claim 4 further characterised in that the slot (31) or groove is of dog-leg configuration (32,33) to provide initial lost motion between the runner (17) and bolt (1) for movement of the runner (17) in the direction to withdraw the bolt (1).   6. a lock according to any one of the preceding claims further characterised in that a part (37) carried with the runner (17) is moved into the withdrawal path of the bolt (1), so as to block withdrawal of the bolt (1), under movement of the runner (17) in the direction for extending the bolt (1), and that said coupling (23) between the runner (17) and bolt (1) provides lost motion between them such that movement of the runner (17) in the direction for withdrawal of the bolt (1) is communicated to the bolt (1) via the     coupling      (23)    only after the runner (37) has moved   bffi-      iciently    to clear said part (37) from the withdrawal-path of the bolt (1).   7. a lock according to claim 6 further characterised in that the said part is a shoulder (37) of the runner (17).    8. a lock according to claim 6 or claim 7 further characterised in that the said part (37) lies immediately behind the bolt (1) and in abutment with a portion (38) of a casing (2) of the lock when blocking withdrawal of the bolt (1) as aforesaid.   9. a lock according to claim 8 further characterised in that the said portion of the lock casing is a wall (38) of the casing (2), and that the said part (37) of the runner (17) runs along this wall (38) throughout movement of the runner (17).   10. a lock according to claim 4 or claim 5 and any one of claims 6 to 9 further characterised in that the slot (31) or groove is configured (39) to provide that forcing of the bolt (1) in its withdrawal direction is resisted by abutment of the bolt (1) with'said part (37) before such forcing is effective to create reaction between the bolt (1) and said coupling (23).
