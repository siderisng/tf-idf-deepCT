<ABSTRACT>
a fibrous composite comprising a coalesced assembly of  (a) a sheet-like mesh structure composed of fibers of a synthe­ tic elastomeric polymer, the individual fibers being intercon­ nected at random in irregular spaced-apart relationship  thereby forming a number of meshes of different shapes and  sizes, said mesh structure having a recovery ratio after 10%  stretch of at least 70% in two arbitrarily selected, mutually  perpendicular directions on the plane of said mesh structure,  and (b) a mat-, web- or sheet-like fibrous structure having a  recovery ratio after 10% stretch of less than 50% in at least one  arbitrarily selected direction.  an elastic fibrous composite of  this invention is suitable as various apparel base materials  and industrial materials such as filter cloths, adsorbents, and  heat insulating materials.
