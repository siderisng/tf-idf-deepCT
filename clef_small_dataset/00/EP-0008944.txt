<ABSTRACT>
a method of hydraulically expansion-swaging a tube  into a tube sheet by abruptly applying a very high pressure  pulse to the already pressurized annular space between a  hydraulic expansion-swaging mandrel core and the tube  being swaged.  with this method it is possible to obtain a  practically zero gap, after removal of the pressure, between  the tube and the bore in which it is swaged.
