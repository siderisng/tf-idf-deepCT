<ABSTRACT>
a low cost, easily fabricated optical sensor comprising a  narrow band filter (1) that is responsive to changes in a  physical parameter, such as temperature or pressure.  the  narrow band filter is fabricated by means of a crystalline  structure, such as an anisotropic crystal (2), that is common to  many hexagonal materials.  polarized incident light waves can  be electromagnetically coupled in the crystal from one  perpendicular optical axis to another at a particular  wavelength, which wavelength is representative of the  physical parameter to be sensed.  the crystal selectively  transmits an output light signal that has the wavelength or  color at which the electromagnetic coupling occurs.  by  detecting and analyzing the wavelength or color of the output  light signal, an accurate indication of the parameter can be  obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. field of the invention. this invention relates to an optical sensor comprising a narrow band crystalline filter, the band-pass of which is a function of a physical parameter to be sensed. 2. prior art. presently, no non-mechanical means is known for varying the band-pass of an optical filter as a function of a physical parameter. optical band-pass filters are known to those skilled in the art. however, most contemporary optical band-filters (e.g., multi-layer interference filters or fabrey-perot cavities) are high cost, relatively complex microfabricated elements of very precise dimension. moreover, the available types of band-pass filters are relatively insensitive to most environmental parameters. so far as is known, no optical filter has heretofore been implemented for utilization in a sensor application, wherein the band-pass of the filter is a function of the physical parameter to be sensed. what is more, nothing is known which shows or suggests a narrow band filter consisting of a single anisotropic crystal and having application as an optical sensor. as will be understood by those skilled in the art, materials existing in a crystalline state are optically distinguishable from materials existing in other physical states, inasmuch as crystals are generally electrically anisotropic. that is, the polarization produced in a crystalline structure by a particular electric field is not simply the product of a scaler constant multiplied by the magnitude of the electric field. however, crystal polarization varies according to a relationship that is dependent upon the direction of the applied electric field relative to the optical axis of the crystal lattice structure. one example of an optical sensor that utilizes an anisotropic crystalline structure for sensing a physical parameter can be found in the u.s. patent application entitled optical temperature sensor utilizing birefringent crystals and assigned docket no. 78e132 by the common assignee thereof. however, the luminous intensity (rather than wavelength or color) of the output signals generated by the aforementioned sensor is processed in order to obtain an indication of the parameter to be sensed. summary of the invention briefly, and in general terms, a low cost, easily fabricated optical sensor is disclosed that is sensitive to a physical parameter, such as temperature, pressure, or the like. the optical sensor includes a narrow band filter comprising an anisotropic crystalline structure. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the band-pass of the filter varies as a function of the physical parameter to be sensed. the filter is fabricated so that the anisotropic crystal is sandwiched between a pair of polarizer elements. in operation, incident white light is supplied to a first of the pair of polarizer elements. the polarized light from the first polarizer element is supplied to the anisotropic crystal, whereby light waves having a light transmitted polarized mode and being propagated in a first direction can be electromagnetically coupled to light waves having a light absorbing polarized mode and being propagated in a second, relatively perpendicular direction. it has been found that the complete electromagnetic coupling of energy between the two polarized
