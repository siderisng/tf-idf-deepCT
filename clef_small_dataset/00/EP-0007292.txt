<ABSTRACT>
valve having a valve housing (1), a slide (3) axially shift­ able in the valve housing (1), at least one valve seat (2) for the  slide (3), a rotatable operating shaft (4) having in its one end a  laterally offset stub-shaft (6) adapted to transfer the rotary  movement of the operating shaft (4) into a corresponding  axial movement of the slide (3) towards its end position as  defined by the valve seat (2).  the valve is characterized by a  coupling member (7) provided on the stub-shaft (6) and hav­ ing a first oblique surface, a second oblique surface provided  on the slide (3) and complementary to the first oblique sur­ face, additional rotation of the operating shaft (4), when the  slide (3) occupies its end position being absorbed by mutual  relative movement between the first and second surfaces and  a complementary movement of the coupling member (7)  along the stub-shaft (6).  the valve is hereby latched in its end  position.

<DESCRIPTION>
valve the present invention generally relates to valves, in particular to valves for controlling and distributing liquid streams from two connections to a third connection or alternatively from one connection to two connections. in connection with warm-water systems there is a particular need of control valves of the type mentioned, for example so-called shunt valves. shunt valves may be designed as so-called slide valves in which the liquid flow is controlled by using a plate provided with ports or recesses, said plate being rotatively disposed in relation to openings in a valve housing. when using this type of valve, the operation of which is performed by turning an operating shaft, it is difficult'to bring about a complete sealing of one of the outlets or inlets of the valve. the valve can be arranged so that the plane slide is urged against the valve housing by a compression spring. as the contact surface between the slide and the valve housing is comparatively large, requirements are severe as far as smoothness of the slide and the valve housing is concerned. thus, valves of this type are expensive in manufacture. another type of shunt valve is the so-called seat valve which has an axially movable slide provided with shoulders adapted sealingly to contact valve seats provided in the valve housing. the slide can be operated either by an axially movable operating shaft or by a rotary operating shaft, the rotary motion of which is transformed into an axial shifting movement of the slide. if the operating shaft is axially shiftable, problems are encountered in case electrical control motors are to be used for operating the valve because the action of such motors normally is based on a rotary function. to a certain extent this problem can be avoided if a shunt valve having a rotary operating shaft is used. independently of which type of operating shaft is used, the important problem of seat valves resides in the fact that the slide must be urged against the valve seating by an external force applied to the operating shaft or by an external torque applied to the operating shaft. this external force or external torque respectively is produced by particular auxiliary units included in the valve. these auxiliary units tend to increase the cost of using seats valves , it is the purpose of the present invention t6 provide a valve avoiding the disadvantages of previously known control valves. thus, the valve of the present invention does not require any auxiliary units with the aid of which the slide is held tightly against thevalve seat. -moreover, the requirements as far as manufacturing tolerances in respect to the component parts of the valve are concerned may be low without impairing the function of the valve. not either does wear of the constructive element participating in the transmission of power between the operating shaft and the slide interfere - within reasonable limits - with the sealing action of the valve. the characteristic features of the valve appear

what i claim is:   1. valve comprising a valve housing (1), a slide (3) axially shiftable in the valve housing, at least one valve seat (2) for the slide, a rotatable operating shaft (4) having at the one end a laterally offset stub-shaft (6) for transforming the rotary movement of the operating shaft into a corresponding axial shift of the slide towards its end position as defined by the valve seat (2), characterized by a coupling member (7) disposed on the stub-shaft and having a first oblique surface, a second oblique surface provided on the slide (3) and complementary to the first oblique surface, additional turning movement of the operating shaft, when the slide is in its end position, being absorbed by mutual adjusting movement between the first and second surfaces and a complementary movement of the coupling member (7) along the stub-shaft (6).   2. valve as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the coupling member (7) is an elongate, wedge-shaped body having a bore adapted to receive the stub-shaft, the said first oblique surface corresponding to one of the oblique surfaces of the body.   3. valve as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the wedge-shaped body is split in its longitudinal direction in a plane parallel to the bore causing two wedge halves   (7)    to be formed.   4. valve as claimed in claim 2 or 3, characterized by a compression spring (11) placed on the stub-shaft between the operating shaft (4) and the wedge-shaped body.   5. valve as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized by a straight, wedge-shaped groove (8) provided in the slide perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the slide, the second oblique surface being formed by the surface of the groove facing the valve seat.    6. valve as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the side walls of the wedge-shaped body (7) are in contact with the side walls of the wedge -shaped groove (8) and that the bottom of the groove and  the bottom surface of the wedge-shaped body are spaced from each other.   7. valve as claimed in any of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that either end of the compression spring is inserted into a bore in one half each of the split body.   8. valve as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the slide is axially shiftable between two valve seats each defining one end position of the slide (3).
