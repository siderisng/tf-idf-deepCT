<ABSTRACT>
1.  an animal-feeding device for dispensing loose feed, especially for horses, comprising a supply hopper (5) for the feed which has connected to its discharge opening (8) a dosing device for metering out a predetermined amount of feed comprising a closed dosing drum (14) which is arranged underneath the discharge opening (8) of the supply hopper (5), mounted to rotate about a horizontal axis and provided with at least two discharge openings (23a, b) arranged in offset arrangement on the circumference of the dosing drum (14) and communicating with one dosing chamber (25a, b) each, the said discharge openings (23a, b) being arranged in a manner such that in a first drum position at least one of them (23b) and in a second drum position at least another one of them (23a) is aligned with and connected in sealing relationship to the discharge opening (8) while the other filling and discharge opening (23a, b) being not so connected is downwardly directed and connected to an outlet element leading to the feeding positions, the dosing drum (14) being coupled to selectively controllable drive means (17) imparting to it the rotary movement necessary for performing the filling and discharge cycles, characterized in that each of the filling and discharge openings (23a, b) of the dosing drum (14) has associated to it a discharge channel (12a, b) leading to a feeding position and that the filling and discharging cycle of the one dosing chamber (25a) is oppositely directed to that of the other dosing chamber (25b) relative to the sense of rotation of the dosing drum (14), and that the drive means (17) driving the dosing drum (14) alternately in one and then in the opposite directions is adapted to cause the dosing drum (14) to make only one incomplete revolution at a time.
