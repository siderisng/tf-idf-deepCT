<ABSTRACT>
centrifugal pump for introducing powdered solids into a  pressurized space (e. g.  coal in a pressurized gasifier) compris­ ing a feed inlet (8) and a rotor (6) with passages (10) extending  radially outwards from the rotor inlet.  the pump also com­ rises a pump-shell (1) that diverges in the direction of rota­ tion (27) and preferably communicates with a diffuser (3).  the  shell may consist of two or more identical parts that each  surround part of the rotor and the shell may comprise gas  inlets.  a coal gasification process and apparatus using the  said pump are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
centrifugal primp for powder lkd a ?rccess and - - - - apparatus for the gasification of coal powder the invention relates to a centrifugal pump for the introduction of powder into a pressurized space, comprising an inlet and a rotor, the inlet leading to the centre of the rotor and the rotor having one or more essentially radial passages normal to the axis of rotation which passages communicate with the aid inlet and are open at their outward extremity. such pumps are grown from the u.s. patent specifications nos. 2,822,097; 3,182,825; 4,049,133 anz 4,120,410 and act as ejecting centrifugal pump, i.e. the powder is ejected by the rotor at high velocity into a large vessel, in which vessel the velocity of the particles is reduced to zero. the powder is passed to the centre of the rotor via the inlet and moves in the rotor by the effect of the cen+urifugal force through the racial passages away from the centre of the rotor in an outward direction and finally leaves these passages through the open extqrp-;ty with a radial and tangential velocity component. these pumps are used, for example, to introduce pulverulent solid fuel into a pressurized vessel, such as coal powder which is passed via a vessel to a reactor for the partial combustion of coal which reactor is connected to the vessel. the pressure in the vessel is usually at least 10 atm. and the pump serves to introduce the coal powder which is at atmospheric pressure into the vessel against the pressure difference under these conditions the velocity at which the particles leave the rotor is high, in the order of 100 m/sec. in a tangential direction and 10 m/sec. in a radial direction. the energy invested in this velocity has so far not beec put to further use, which is a drawback. besides it may under certain conditions be disadvantageous for the powder particles to be subjected to a rise in temperature by the friction caused by rapid deceleration in the equipment described in tee abovementioned patent specifications. the present invention envisages the removal of these disadvantages and to this end proposes surrounding the rotor by a casing of which the radial distance to the rotor increases in the direction of rotation to a point at which the casing leads away from the rotor in a tangential direction. the resultant space between the rotor and the casing ensures optimum retention of momentum of the medium ultimately leaving the pump, i.e., the powder particles optimally retain the initial tangential velocity component in the said space and also the gas entrained by the particles optimally assumes this velocity. in this respect it is essential that starting from the point where the distance between rotor and casing is smallest seen in the direction of rotation - the space becomes larger as the rotor ejects more powder into the space. in the axial direction both sides of the casing may border the lateral faces of the rotor at which
