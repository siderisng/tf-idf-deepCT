<ABSTRACT>
a low leakage integrator 15 used in a carburetor  feedback control system is disclosed.  the integrator com­ prises an operational amplifier 47 having a feedback  capacitor 51 coupled between its output 52 and its in­ verting input terminal 46.  input voltages are coupled  through a resistor 41 to the inverting input terminal 46  and a pair of controllable gates 43, 44 are utilized to  implement an integrate and hold mode of operation for  the integrator while minimizing the drift of the integrator  output due to leakage currents during the hold mode of  the integrator.  the carburetor control system utilizes the above  integrator in combination with a fuel mixture sensor 11  and an engine position sensor 21 to produce an output  voltage related to the sensed fuel mixture.  this output  voltage is utilized to control a solenoid 12 that adjusts  the setting of a carburetor valve to thereby alter the  carburetor fuel mixture as desired.
