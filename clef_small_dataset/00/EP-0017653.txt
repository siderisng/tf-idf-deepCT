<ABSTRACT>
a method of quenching anode effect during the pro­ duction of aluminium by electrolytic reduction by tilting  the anode about a suitable axis for a short period, as soon  as anode effect has started, so that the wearing surface  of the anode forms an angle of 0. 1-20° c with the horizon­ tal, and subsequently returning the anode to its normal  position; said method being called "anode rocking".  the orders to start or stop, as well as the duration and  the scope of anode rocking, are given by a control device  which measures the voltage across the electrolytic cell, or  some other suitable parameter, and compares it with a pre­ set value.  this control device also organizes the usual  operating manoeuvers for the pot line.  simultaneously with  tilting operation, or whilst stationary in the inclined  position, the anode may also be moved up and down.  du­ ring anode rocking, the angle formed by its wearing surface  with the horizontal can vary.  by the method according to the invention, the duration  of the anode effect can be substantially reduced with con­ sequent reduction in the energy consumed by the electro­ lytic process, thus improving the economy of the oper­ ation.

<DESCRIPTION>
quenching anode effect by anode rocking this invention relates to a method of quenching anode effect during the production of aluminium by electrolytic smelting. the invention is particularly suitable for the automatic operation of pots and potlines. aluminium is normally produced by the hall-heroult method which involves the use of an electrolytic cell operating in the temperature range 9500 - 9800 c, decomposing alumina dissolved in a bath of molten cryolite. normally, over 100 such cells or pots are connected in series. the individual electrolytic cell consists of a flat vessel with low sides, built of steel plates. inside this steel shell there is a refractory layer which surrounds a carbon lining. the carbon lining contains the molten bath, which consists of cryolite with various additives. the carbon walls of the vessel are usually covered with frozen bath which continues some way out along the bottom. most of the carbon bottom is free of frozen bath and serves as the cathode. the entire bottom is covered with molten aluminium, extracted from the alumina, and this aluminium has a higher specific gravity than the molten bath. the anode, which is made of carbon, is partly immersed in the bath which, as mentioned above, consists mainly of molten cryolite and dissolved alumina. the distance between the bottom of the anode and the molten metal on the cathode is called the acd (anode-cathode-distance) or the interpolar distance and is in the region of 2-7 cm. the bath can also contain other substances to influence the solubility of the alumina and the freezing point of the bath. this subject is discussed in a number of publications, but, as will be understood, these additives are of no interest in connection with the present invention. the bath around the anode is covered with a crust of frozen bath. on top of this crust the alumina is laid so that it is pre-heated before being pushed down into the bath. during normal operations, the electrolytic reduction process takes place with a voltage drop from anode to cathode of between 4 and 6 v, depending upon the cell design chosen. at the beginning of the reduction process the concentration of the alumina in the bath can lie around 6-8 %. the electrolytic process decomposes the alumina. the metal thus extracted sinks down on to the cathode, whilst the oxygen is liberated on the underside of the anode. the anode is thus oxidized and is consumed, whilst at the same time the alumina content is the bath is reduced. when the alumina concentration in the bath falls below a certain critical value - about 2 % - depending upon the temperature of the bath and the current density of the anode etc., the steady electrolysis process is replaced by an anode effect. this reveals itself in the form of a sudden increase in the resistance of the electrolytic cell, which in the course of seconds can increase tenfold. this increase in resistance is normally attributed to a layer of
