<ABSTRACT>
lateral force is applied to a web by apparatus including  an air bearing surface to guide the edge of the web against a  fixed reference surface.  a bearing surface 15 over which the  web 18 is movable includes an arrangement of holes 24, 25 for  establishing a differential flow across the bearing surface 15  to produce a lateral force on the web 18 in the direction of a lip  20 having a reference surface 21.  the holes 24 and 25 are  arranged asymmetrically relative to the intended centre line  16 of the web over surface 15 but parallel to the reference  surface 21.  there are twice as many holes 24.  a common  source 32 of air under pressure supplies the bearing surface  holes.  the differential air flow may be established by different  sizes of holes through the bearing surface or by differing air  permeability of porous material forming the bearing surface.
