<ABSTRACT>
1.  tattooing pincers for marking the ears of animals, comprising a needle jaw movable against spring tension towards a counterjaw and having a plurality of hollow needles which project into the jaw gap between the jaws and which at their inner ends are connected to an intermediate chamber disposed on the needle jaw and variable in its volume upon actuation of the pincers, which intermediate chamber is connected via at least one non-return valve with a storage container for the tattooing liquid, characterised by a force-locked connection (return spring 36) between the needle jaw (42) and the actuating mechanism (16) of the pincers, and, when it yields at the end of the penetration process of the needles (43) the free length of which is less than the thickness of the ears to be tattooed, the volume of the intermediate chamber (34) is necessarily reduced, whereupon the tatooing liquid contained therein is forced out into the ear of the animal.
