<ABSTRACT>
Phase (PE) coded binary data decoding process, frequency modulation (FM) or modified frequency modulation (MFM), allowing the resynchronization of the clock to each transition from the signal level represent both these data. According to this method, the transitions of the signal, positive or negative, are applied by an input line (flow) to a unit (1) which ensures the separation of impulses into a short and long data pulses for the PE and FM codes. and short, medium and long lasting for the MFM code and delivers sampling signals (Spinning.) for detecting long pulses (long.) and detection of medium pulse (in the case of the MFM code). Used by an interpretation unit 2 to cause loading of the data bits decoded in a shift register 3 and their transfer to an output register 4, when it detected the end of a complete character.
