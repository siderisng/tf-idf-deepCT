<ABSTRACT>
a gear-changing device for a cycle comprises a rear  derailleur controllable in use of the device by a control wire  (w), said derailleur comprising a bracket (1) for connection to  a fork end (e) of the cycle and a pantograph mechanism  pivotally connected to said bracket (1) by a first horizontal  spindle (3).  the pantograph mechanism comprises a support  member (2) pivotally connected to said bracket (1) by said  horizontal spindle (3), two linkage members (5,6) pivotally  connected to said support member (2) by spindle (7,8) per­ pendicular to said first horizontal spindle (3), and a movable  member (9) pivotally connected to said two linkage members  (5,6) through corresponding spindles (10, 11) also substan­ tially perpendicular to said first horizontal spindle (3).  the  movable member (9) is pivotally conned by a second horizon­ tal spindle (15) substantially parallel to said first horizontal  spindle to a chain cage (14).  a control wire holder (16) secures  one end of said control wire (w) to the device.  in order to minimize inefficient force transfer and other  disadvantages associated with the use of bowden cables, the  control wire holder (16) is provided on one of said two linkage  members (5,6) and the movable member (9) of said panto­ graph mechanism; at least one control wire guide (17) is  provided for guiding said control wire (w).  the control wire  guide (17) is disposed in a position spaced from the axis of the  sprocket assembly (s) and outwardly beyond an imaginary  straight line (x-x) connecting the control wire engaging por­ tion of said wire holder (16) and the first horizontal spindle (3).   in use of the device, said control wire (w) is operated in the  absence of a resistance above a predetermined value against  axial movement of the chain cage (14), to transform said  pantograph mechanism with displacement of the chain cage  (14) axially relative to said sprocket assembly (s), said panto­ graph mechanism also swings around said first horizontal  spindle (3) to displace the chain cage generally radially of said  sprocket assembly (s).
