<ABSTRACT>
in inserting a bar (12) of metal into a refractory crucible  (10) of a conventional vacuum furnace, a covering (23) is  placed over the leading end (22) of the bar (12) to reduce  ring of the crucible (10) and the production of chips or  particles of refractory material.  the covering (23) is softer than  the refractory crucible (10) and has shock absorbing properties.   the covering (23) is disintegrated upon heating of the bar  (12) and turns into constituent components which have no  adverse effect on the chemical composition of the molten  meta to be poured from the crucible (10).  in the preferred  practice, the covering is a preformed boot (23) which fits the  leading end (22) of the bar (12) and is formed of an expanded  unsaturated aliphathic or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon  polymer such as expanded polyethylene.
