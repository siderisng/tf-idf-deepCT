<ABSTRACT>
the drainage and retention properties of an aqueous  cellulosic suspension substantially free of filler and which is  being used for the production of paper or paper board are  improved by including a water soluble high molecular  weight substantially non-ionic polymer and a bentonite-type  clay.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
many grades of paper include substantial levels of inorganic fillers such as kaolinite, calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide. for instance good quality paper, often referred to as fine paper, may be made from high grade bleached chemical pulp and may contain 5 to 35%, by weight of dry paper, of inorganic filler. in the production of such papers it is common to use retention aids and drainage aids. the cost of these is more than offset by the increased retention of filler in the sheet and by the reduction of filler in the white water and the subsequent loss in effluent discharge, especially in view of increasing costs of raw materials and pressure from environmental legislation to restrict effluent discharge. a variety of retention and drainage aids are known such as polyacrylamides (pam), polyethyleneimines (pei), polyamides and polyamines. in us patent specification no. 3052595 the use of polyacrylamides with filler is particularly described and is stated that advantageous results are obtained when bentonite provides 1 to 20% by weight of the mineral filler. in british patent specification no. 1265496 it is described how polyacrylamides are used to retain inorganic filler and cellulosic fines but that critical conditions have to be observed for successful operation, and particular modified acrylamides are described. retention and drainage aids are generally used at levels of 100 to 500 grams/tonne of dry polymer on a dry paper weight. at these amounts cost effective advantages can easily be demonstrated in the production of filled or fine papers. there is, however, very large scale production of paper that is substantially unfilled, for instance as newsprint and fluting medium, for instance in the production of board. the unfilled paper is substantially free of filler, generally containing less than 5%, by weight of dry paper, of filler and often there is no deliberate addition of filler to the pulp from which the paper or board is made. generally the pulp for the newsprint and fluting medium originates from canada or scandinavia and is of low grade fibres. with such pulps it would still be desirable to minimise the wastage of the components of the pulp, i.e to improve retention of pulp components in the paper, but it is not easy to demonstrate cost effective advantages by using the known retention and drainage aids for this purpose since the pulps have a high cationic demand. the cationic demand is the amount of cationic polymer that has to be added to give any significant increase in fibre retention and improvement in drainage on the forming wire. the cationic demand is often above 0.1 % so that improvements are only significant with polymer weights of above 1,000 grams dry plymer per tonne dry weight of paper and such amounts render the treatment uneconomic. the papermaking fibres used in canada and scandinavia for newsprint and fluting medium are low grade fibres and are predominantly of the mechanical type and include groundwood, thermomechanical pulp, deinked secondary fibres, semi-chemical pulps and semi-bleached chemical kraft pulps, normally

<CLAIMS>
1. a method in which newsprint or fluting medium is made  from an aqueous suspension of cellulosic fibres that is  substantially free of filler and that has been formed from  a pulp having a cationic demand of at least 0.1% and in  which the drainage and retention properties of the  suspension are improved by including in the suspension a  water soluble polymer and 0.02 to 2% (dry weight based on  the dry weight of the suspension) of a bentonite type clay,  wherein the polymer is a substantially non-ionic polyacrylamide polymer  containing 1 to 10 mole % acrylic acid groups and having molecular  weight above 1 million and the clay is added to the pulp and  the polymer is subsequently added to the pulp containing  the clay and the newsprint or fluting medium contains less than  5% by weight total filler. 2. a method according to claim 1 characterised in that  the polymer is a copolymer of acrylamide with from 1 to 8  mole % acrylic acid groups. 3. a method according to claim 1 characterised in that  the polymer is a copolymer of about 97 mole % acrylamide  with about 3 mole % acrylic acid. 4. a method according to any preceding claim  characterised in that the amount of bentonite clay is from  0.02 to 2% and the amount of polymer is from 0.005 to 0.1%,  dry weight based on the dry weight of suspension. 5. a method according to any preceding claim  characterised in that the amount of inorganic filler other  than the bentonite that is added to the suspension is zero  or less than 3% by weight.    6. a method according to any preceding claim  characterised in that the aqueous suspension is free of  aluminium sulphate and is formed from substantially only  pulp, water, the polymer, the bentonite type clay and,  optionally, filler in an amount such that the amount of  filler including bentonite type clay is less than 5% by  weight based on the dry weight of the newsprint or fluting  medium.
