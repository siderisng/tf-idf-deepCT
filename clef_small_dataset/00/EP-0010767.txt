<ABSTRACT>
an electronic control system (10) for safely operating  a pair of redundant solenoid type valves (14, 16; 15, 17)  utilizes an alternating current potential (25, 26) for enerÂ­ gizing the valves.  the first valve coil (14) is energized  across the applied potential by a first scr (52) and then  is placed in series with the second valve coil (15).  the  second valve coil (15) is energized when applying the  a.  c.  potential (25, 26) to a series circuit including the  first and second valve coils (14, 15) and a second scr  (56).  the series combination is selected so that once the  valves are energized they will stay open in the series  configuration.
