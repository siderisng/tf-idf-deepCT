<ABSTRACT>
3-formyl derivatives of cyproheptadine of the structural  formula    or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein r is  hydrogen, c₁₋₃ alkyl or fluoro, and the dotted line represents  saturation or unsaturation, are appetite stimulants and anti­ histaminic agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
3-formylcyproheptadine and analogs, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. background of the invention this invention is concerned with 3-formyl derivatives of cyproheptadine and related compounds which are appetite stimulants and antihistaminic agents. cyproheptadine itself and certain derivatives and analogs are known to be orexigenic and antihistaminic agents such as 3-carboxycyproheptadine in u.s. patent 3,981,877, 3-carboxy-l0,11-dihydro- cyproheptadine in british patent 1,486,847, 10-oxo (or hydroxy)-l0,11-dihydrocyproheptadine in u.s. patent 3,960,872. now with this invention there are provided further novel cyproheptadine derivatives and analogs carrying a 3-formyl group and novel processes for their preparation. there is also provided a novel method of stimulating appetite and/or producing an antihistamine effect in patients in need of such treatment by the administration of one or more of the novel compounds or novel pharmaceutical compositions thereof which are also provided by this invention. detailed description of the invention the novel compounds of this invention have structural formula: emi2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein r represents hydrogen, c13 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, especially methyl, or fluoro; and the dotted line represents saturation or unsaturation of the molecule at the 10,11position. it is preferred that r be hydrogen. the novel compounds of this invention with a 10,11-double bond demonstrate atropisomerism and exist as dextro- and levorotatory enantiomers. the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel compounds of this invention are acid addition salts formed from a novel compound and an organic or inorganic acid recognized by the art as providing a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobronide, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, pamoate, citrat-e, napsylate, pyruvate, isethionate, maleate, fumolrate, or the like. the salts are prepared by dissolving approximately equimolecular amounts of the free base compound and the desired acid in a solven: followed by crystallization of the salt produc;:. the novel process of this invention comprises the oxidation of the corresponding 3-hydroxymethyl compound to the 3-formyl analog. the preferred oxidizing agent for this purpose is sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex in dimethylsulfoxide. the reaction is conducted at about 0 to 500c but preferably at about ambient temperature, in the presence of a strong base such as a tri(cl 3 alkyl)amine, such as triethylamine, pyridine, or n-methylpiperidine or the like, over a period of about 6 to 24 hours. in the method of treatment and pharmaceutical composition aspects of the present invention it is noted that the precise unit dosage form and dosage level depend upon the case history of the individual being treated and consequently are left to the discretion of the therapist. in general, however, the compounds of the present invention produce the desired effect of appetite stimulation when given at from about 0.01 to about 10.0 mg per kg body weight per day. the preferred form of delivery of the instant compounds for appetite stimulation of domestic animals is by solution in drinking water or performulated feedstuffs. for human and animal administration, any of the usual pharmaceutical oral forms may be employed such as tablets, elixirs and aqueous suspensions comprising from about
