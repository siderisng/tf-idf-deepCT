<ABSTRACT>
recombinant dna molecules and hosts transformed with  them which produce polypeptides displaying hbv antigenicity  and genes coding therefor and method of making and using  these molecules, hosts, genes and polypeptides.  the recombi­ nant dna molecules of this invention are characterized by  structural genes that code for at least one polypeptide display­ ing hbv antigenicity.  in appropriate hosts these recombinant  dna molecules permit the production and identification of  genes and polypeptides characteristic of hbv antigenicity and  their use in compositions and methods for detecting hbv virus  infections in humans and stimulating the production of antibo­ dies against this infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field of inventionthis invention relates to specific recombinant dna molecules contained in specific transformed hosts. the rekombinant dna molecules comprise hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna operatively linked to expression control sequences such that hbv polypeptides can be expressed. this invention also relates to the specific host strains that are transformed with those recombinant hbv dna molecules. this invention also relates to a process for producing a polypeptide displaying hbv antigenicity comprising the step of culturing those specific hosts. background art the virus that causes hepatitis b or serum hepatitis appears to infect only man. hepatitis b virus ("hbv") infection in humans is widespread. in the united kingdom, united states, and western europe, approximately 0.1% of all blood donors are chronic carriers of hbv. while the death rate due to viral heptitis is not high (in 1975 in the united kingdom it was 3 per million), there are indications that as many as 5% of the population in the united kingdom and 15% of the population in the united states have been infected. in many african and asian countries, up to twenty percent of the population are chronic carriers of hbv, and over fifty percent of all adults in those countries have been or are infected with hbv. the hepatitis infection is transmitted by three general mechanisms: (1) by parenteral inoculation of infected blood or body fluids, either in large amounts as in blood transfusions or in minute amounts as through an accidental skinprick; (2) by close family or sexual contact; and (3) by some mothers, who infected during pregnancy, transmit the virus to their new-born children. under natural conditions, hbv is not highly contagious. transmission by inhalation occurs rarely, if ever. most hbv infections are subclinical. the clinical illness usually lasts three to six weeks and ranges in severity from mild to acute fulminating hepatitis followed by cirrhosis or death. recovery from clinical and subclinical hbv infections is usually complete. however, serious long term consequences result in some cases: (1) approximately five percent of acute infections lead to chronic carriage of hepatitis b virus antigen with its continuing potential for infectivity to others and ongoing liver damage; and (2) it is likely that past infection with hbv may be wholly or partly responsible for the initiation of a significant proportion of hbv-seronegative cases of chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary liver carcinoma. recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to introduce the dna coding for specific non-bacterial eukaryotic proteins into bacterial cells. in general, with dna other than that prepared via chemical synthesis, the construction of the recombinant dna molecules comprises the steps of producing a single-stranded dna copy (cdna) of a purified messenger (mrna) template for the desired protein; converting the cdna to double-stranded dna; linking the dna to an appropriate site in an appropriate cloning vehicle and transforming an appropriate host with that recombinant dna molecule. such transformation permits the host to produce the desired protein. in addition, at least in the case of ovalbumin
