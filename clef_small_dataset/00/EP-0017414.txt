<ABSTRACT>
device for delivering precise measured quantities of a  plurality of reagents with each reagent being incorporated in  a device and each being water soluble.  the device has a  water impervious support (10) secured to one or more faces  of which are discrete and separate elements (17-20) each  containing water soluble or dispersible binder and dispersed  therein a water soluble or dispersible reagent.  the reagent of  each element in the device is reactive with at least one  constituent in an assay medium or with at least one other  reagent on the device.  the device is used by contacting it  with the assay medium until the elements dissolve comÂ­ pletely.
