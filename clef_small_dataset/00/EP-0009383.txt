<ABSTRACT>
a device for attachment of a resilient and/or flexible  tube (23) to a nipple, nozzle or like connection (35) to  enable the resilient and/or flexible tube (23) to be retained  on the nipple, nozzle or like connection (35) in normal use.  in order to provide security for the resilient and/or  flexible tube (23), a retaining element (37) is provided  which has an aperture (38, 39) therein of longer diameter  than the tube (23) with which it is intended to be used, the  diameter of the aperture (38, 39) being large enough to  pass over the tube (23) when the tube is in position on the  nipple, nozzle or like connection (35) but small enought to  cause the resilient and/or flexible tube (23) to grip the nipÂ­ ple, nozzle or like connection (35).
