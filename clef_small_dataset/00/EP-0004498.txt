<ABSTRACT>
Device generating the locking voltage of a cathode ray tube.According to the invention, the locking voltage and the video voltage are applied to the cathode (5) of the electron barrel.The device comprises an amplifier (1) for the video signals which has a control input (4) connected to the output (22) of memory means (21) of a signal representing the cathodic current for moments ofsampling during which the video signal is zero.If the intensity of the cathodic current is not zero during the sampling instants, the output voltage of the amplifier (1) increases.The invention allows the automatic adjustment of the blocking voltage of the color television tubes.
