<ABSTRACT>
a remotely operated and monitored tool support and  positioning apparatus for retubing a steam generator  adapted for mounting below the tubesheet of a vertically  standing nuclear steam generator.  a tool holding arm  comprises a platform with an opening and a rotatable plate  (50) supported thereon with a vertical hollow shaft (48)  extending downwardly through the opening (28).  the lower  surface of said plate (50) has a plurality of cavities (58) evenly  spaced along a circle whose center is the axis of rotation of  said plate (50), and an indexing means including a movable  pin (62) is associated with said platform (24) so as to be  received in said cavities (58), the pin (62) being movable  between a fully retracted position permitting rotation of said  plate (50) and a fully protruding position for indexed seating  within one of said cavities (58) to position said plate (50) in an  exact angular position.  this arrangement facilitates remote positioning of a tool  in limited and radioactive area of a nuclear steam generator  heat for repair work.
