<ABSTRACT>
a rotary cutterblock for woodworking machinery has a  body made up of a row of discs (10) of different diameters.   the disc diameters are chosen to approximate, as far as  possible, the profile of a timber moulding to be formed, and  discs can be selected from a stock of standard sizes.  the use  of spacers (22) between adjacent discs enables the mass to  be kept to a minimum.  the cutterblock is quiet in use,  especially when blades clamped in successive discs are  staggered around the circumference of the cutterblock.  a  preferred method of manufacture of such a cutterblock  having staggered blades comprisises initially mounting the  discs (10) on a mounting shaft with the blades (14) in  axial-alignment for grinding purposes, and then removing  the discs (10) from the mounting shaft and reassembling  them in the same sequence but angularly offset one from  another.
