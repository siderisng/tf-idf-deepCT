<ABSTRACT>
a normally closed pressure compensated flow control  valve assembly for use with a hydraulic cylinder provides  metering of fluid from the cylinder at a constant desired rate  for lowering a load connected thereto at a corresponding  constant rate.  the valve assembly includes a first valve (12)  communicating with the cylinder and is selectively actuable  for permitting the flow of fluid from the cylinder.  a pressure  compensating valve (14) is in communication with the first  valve (12) and maintains a constant fluid flow pressure and a  constant fluid flow rate from the cylinder.  a baffle (72) is in  communication between the first valve (12) and the pressure  compensating valve (14).  the pressure compensating valve  (14) is normally closed prior to the actuation of the first valve  (12) and opens gradually in response to the fluid exiting the  cylinder to gradually increase the flow rate to a desired level  and to maintain the flow rate constant thereafter.
