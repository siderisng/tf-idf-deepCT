<ABSTRACT>
keyboard key movement is verified with a high degree  of accuracy in a manner largely immune to ambient noise or  other electronic or electromagnetic interference.  a pulse  signal in the form of a train of pulses, is periodically applied  to the circuit associated with each key.  the signal coupled  through the key-controlled circuit is reconstructed only if it  exceeds a predetermined reference level.  a test, which  depends on the previously verified key state, is made to  determine the existing key state.  the test for the active key  state is conditioned on multiple true comparisons of a recon足 structed signal with the originally applied signal throughout  the duration of the test.  the test for the inactive key state is  conditioned on the absence of a reconstructed signal  throughout the test.  in both instances the newly indicated  key state is compared with the state to which the key is  assumed to have changed from its previsouly verified state.   if the test fails, the key is considered to have remained in its  previously verified state.  immunity to noise is enhanced by making the pulse  signal a pseudo-random signal which is successively applied  across the key-controlled circuits in a timing sequence out of  synchronism with the generation of the pulse signal.  the  system disclosed avoids the requirements for massive shiel足 ding, for selective routing of conductors, or for the assign足 ment of special, physical key locations in the electronic scan足 ning sequence, while providing fully verified key actuation at  reduced overall system cost.
