<ABSTRACT>
1.  travelling track grinder for the grinding of irregularities of the track surface, the said track grinder comprising at least one grinding tool (8, 54) which is vertically and laterally adjustable by an adjusting drive (12, 13, 51, 52) relative to a machine frame (3) which is guided on the rail by travelling mechanisms (4), a measuring device (25) for limiting the grinding depth with the aid of the frame serving as a reference, a control device (26, 62) which is associated with the adjusting drive (12, 13, 51, 52) and a second measuring device (24) for determining and in particular indicating, even during the grinding operation, the distance between a reference surface and a reference base (17) which determines the intended direction of the track surface and which is connected to a monitoring device, characterized in that the second measuring device (24) is associated with the grinding tool (8, 54) and is connected to the control device (26, 62) for controlling the adjusting drive (12, 13, 51, 52) and to the control unit (32, 66), and that the reference surface for determining the distance is the grinding surface (23, 60, 72) of the grinding tool (8, 54).
