<ABSTRACT>
a fluid shear coupling is disclosed herein which comprises  a coupling disc received within a housing.  the  coupling disc and housing are mounted for coaxial rotation,  and the coupling disc is connectable to a drive pulley  assembly for driving the coupling disc in rotation.  the  coupling disc includes a pair of annular flanges extending  axially in opposite directions from the periphery of the disc.   the flanges define inside and outside working surfaces with  the inside and outside working surfaces including helical  grooves for moving a fluid received against those surfaces in  a predetermined direction.  the housing includes working  portions closely conforming to the working surfaces of the  flanges.  a fluid reservoir is defined by the housing and is  operable to move a working fluid into the space between the  flanges and the working portions of the housing to provide  variable coupling of the housing with the coupling disc.
