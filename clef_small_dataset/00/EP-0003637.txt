<ABSTRACT>
a lawn mower consists of a generally dome-shaped housing  (12) surrounding an air impeller (17) and a rotary cutter (18),  the impeller and the cutter being driven by a motor (10) supported  above a central opening (20) in the roof (11) of the  housing (12) such that rotation of the impeller induces a flow of  air into the housing through the central opening.  the motor (10)  is surrounded by a protective shroud (13, 14, 15) which includes  at least one air intake located such that air is initially drawn into  the shroud (13, 14, 15) at a level or levels above that of the  central opening (20) in the roof (11) of the housing (12) and is  then drawn downwardly and inwardly such that it is moving in a  direction substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the  impeller (17) before passing through the central opening (20).
