<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for measuring the level level of liquid metal in a coke, in particular special in a continuous casting coccery. It is known that by means of the amendments of a conductor enhancing magnetic fields in the conductor streams are decorated, and that from the secondary fields of these currents to the presence of the conductor can be closed. However, such measurement methods fail in the strand casting of steel, as the well-conducting copper caffilla shields the fields so much that the sensitivity of the Messeinrich Tung can not satisfy. According to the invention, the influence of the mold (K) is turned off by turning two secondary coils (S1 and S2) ver, which are coaxially and symmetrically relating to the field drawing primary coil (P1) and electrically connected against each other, so that only the asymmetry in the anord of the liquid conductor to the coils causes an induced voltage. If there is no metal in the mold (K), the total confusal voltage is equal to zero. If the bathroom mirror (B) rises, voltages are preferably induced in the lower coil, so that the resulting voltage increases. At maximum asymmetry, ie when the bathroom mirror (B) is between the secondary coils (S1 and S2), a maximum of the total confused tension is achieved. If the bathroom mirror continues to rise, Asymmet Rie and Total Condundary Voltage disappear.
