<ABSTRACT>
a foil (5) is provided for incorporation into a tape  cassette so as to lie over the spools fitted in the cassette.   the foil (5) incorporates two openings (6) for the receipt  of two hubs in the cassette and a window aperture (7) enabling  the amount of tape on a spool to be viewed through  a corresponding opening in the cassette.  a foil is formed  from a paper sheet (11) coated on one side with a friction  reducing material and the window aperture (7) is covered  by a strip of transparent material (12) attached to the other  side of the paper sheet (11).  the transparent material (12)  may be provided as a lamination of two sheets one of which  carries a pressure sensitive adhesive leaving an edge portion  (13) for attachment to the paper sheet (11), the non-coated  laminated sheet projecting at the other side (14).   the provision of a separate transparent sheet (12) means  that the friction reducing surface of the foil (5) is not interfered  with whilst the tape cassette itself can have a completely  open window portion.
