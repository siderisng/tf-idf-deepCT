<ABSTRACT>
production of a large granule starch protective material  for pressure sensitive microencapsulated coatings, particularly  in carbonless copy duplicating paper.  an aqueous slurry of wheat barley or rye starch is fed to a  first hydrocyclone, providing a partial separation of the  granules.  the overflow and underflow of this hydrocyclone  are further separated in a second and third hydrocyclone,  respectively.  the underflow and overflow, respectively, of  these are recirculated to the first hydrocyclone feed stream.   the underflow stream leaving the third hydrocyclone contains  40% or more of the feed starch (dry basis) with a particle  size distribution in which about 38% of the particles range  from 20 to 32 microns and about 70% of the particles range  from 16 to 32 microns.  the best balance of the system, and the highest yield of  large granule product, is obtained when the particle size distribution  of the recirculation streams matches that of the feed  stream.  the large granule cereal starch product collected from the  underflow of the second hydrocyclone may be further  upgraded in average particle size by blending a minor amount  of a large granule starch therewith.
