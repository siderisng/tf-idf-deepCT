<ABSTRACT>
Device for cleaning dentures with a base (1) in which an electrically driven diaphragm air pump (9) is located and a cleaning vessel (24) set to the base (1).The outlet (20) of the air pump (9) and a lead in the interior of the vascular line (26) engage sealingly in each other when placing the vessel.The line (26) opens in a fine-pored distributor (29).The exiting air bubbles are so small that they fill the entire cross section of the cleaning room (34) lying in the vessel.In these, a can (39) can be used, which receives the prostheses to be cleaned.Devices for controlling the amount of air and the metered allocation of cleaning fluid can be provided.
