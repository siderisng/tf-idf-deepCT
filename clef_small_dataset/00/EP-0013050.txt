<ABSTRACT>
a process for sour water treatment in which the sour  components are removed from a sour water stream 32 in an  electrodialysis step 22-28 in which the said stream becomes  the dilute stream.  a resulting concentrate stream 42, richer in  the sour components than the original stream 32 is then  steam stripped in stripper 30.  in order to balance the acidic  and basic components in the dilute stream the component  lacking may be added to the stream by line 60.  steam-stripped  concentrate 48 may be recirculated to the electrodialysis step.   in order to prevent build-up of non-strippable components in  the concentrate stream 48 a part 50 of the latter may be bled  off, if desired subjected to further steam stripping in column  32 after which the steam-stripped concentrate 56 may be  combined with dilute stream 36.

<DESCRIPTION>
process fob the removal of volatile ionisible components from aqueous streams this invention relates to a process for treating aqueous streams to remove volatile ionisable components, and more specifically a volatile acid and a volatile base. it is particularly suitable for treatment of sour water to remove ammonia and hydrogen sulphide and other contaminants. conventionally, sour water, particularly from refineries, is treated by stripping it with steam. such a process is capable of producing treated water which meets the present waste water effluent regulations in most countries of the world. it is however expensive to operate because of the large quantity of steam required, particularly at lower concentrations of the contaminants. for instance, to achieve a, say, 50% reduction in the volatile components, very nearly the same quantity of steam will be required whether the initial concentration is in the order of 20000 ppm or 200 pom. an object of the invention is to provide a process for reducing the concentration of volatile ionisable component a in an aqueous solution to a very low level in a way that is more efficient in its use of energy. in accordance with the invention a process for treating an aqueous stream to remove volatile acidic and volatile basic components from it comprises subjecting the stream to an electrodialysis step in which acidic and basic components migrate from the stream through fixed anion and cation exchange membranes respectively to one or more concentrate stream and steam stripping concentrate stream(s), in order to remove volatile acidic and basic components. the process is considered particularly suitable for treating refinery sour water containing e2s and we3. in aqueous solution the large fraction of the sulphur in the sulphide is in the monovalent hs or undissociated r2s form, very little s= being present. in the case where there is an excess of nh over h2s a significant proportion of the ammonia will be in the undissociated form. in addition, sour water often contains other ionic species, for example, phenolates, formates, emanates, carbonates and the like. it lay also contain some metal ions such as iron, cobalt and vanadium in small amounts. unlike a #acl solution, for example, sour water is not necessarily a good electrolyte and behaves very differently. not only are the equilibria of the various reactions substantially different, but also the molar ratio of se4+ +cations to the hs anions is not 4 necessarily 1 to 1. we have, however, found that it is possible to concentrkte such sour water streams by electrodialysis even at quite low concentrations, so that the resulting dilute stream may have a very low final h2s and content. this stream is thereby also rendered suitable for being subjected to any further treatment required, e.g. by biological means. in general the efficiency of the electrodialysis step is high in terms of electric power utilisation. its efficient use of energy stems from the fact that it is virtually only the ions which pass through a membrane to a concentrate stream which use
