<ABSTRACT>
a vaginal diaphragm has a peripheral structure (3′)  of oval or circular outline which is straddled by an elasto­ meric cap (2′).  in addition, the peripheral structure (3′)  may be of circular or of oval or elliptical cross-section in  direction normal to the major axis of the oval outline, thus  providing a relatively flat outer circumferential surface  which engages the wall of the vaginal cavity over a com­ paratively large area and, hence, with low specific surface  pressure.  the elastomeric cap (2′) is joined to the peri­ pheral structure (3′) at the level of the mid-plane (m-m)  of the diaphragm.  the size of the diaphragm can be in­ creased or decreased by bending one or more shape-retain­ ing sections (8′) housed in a closed coil spring (4′) so that  a single diaphragm can be readily accomadated to a num­ ber of different size requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
vaginal diaphragm consisting of a dome made of elastomeric material which is joined to a peripherical closed coil spring housing a bendable shape-retaining armour. the invention relates to an improved vaginal diaphragm con sisting of a dome made of elastomeric material which is joined to a peripherical closed coil spring housing a bendable shape-retaining armour. vaginal diaphragm are known in which the periphery is circu lar, the cross section of the peripherical structure, formed by the peripherical coil spring and by the peripherical edge of the dome, is joined to said peripherical structure tangent with said circular cross section. in some known diaphragms the peripherical coil spring (that in the following will be referred to as "spring" only) houses a bendable shape-retaining armour consisting of metal arched sections which are connected each other by small coil springs so that, to intro duce the diaphragm into the vaginal cavity, the diaphragm may be bent about said small coil springs by lightly pressing two opposite points of the peripherical structure by two fingers. in other known diaphragms no armour is housed in the spring. it is known that the scope of said armour is to assure the engagement of the peripherical structure to the inner wall of the vaginal cavity. a diaphragm of this type is described in "population reports" of department of medical and public affairs, the george washington university - medical center, 2001 s. street, n.w. washington d.c. 20009. such known diaphragms do not allow to vary the perimeter which requires to provide for a fairly large variety of diaphragms of different diameters. the circular shape of the diaphragms, the spring of which houses the arched sections, does not fit the nearly oval cross section of the vaginal cavity and this causes non uniform and troubling pressures of the diaphragm on the inner wall of said cavity. on the other hand, with the diaphragms which do not house an armour, the engagement with said inner wall is not enough to assure a safe contraceptive barrier. moreover, such diaphragms are to be introduced in said cavity with the dome convexity outwardly directed and, consequently, a fingernail could nick or pierce the dome, when extracting the diaphragm, since no good grip point is available. finally, the circular dome, once introduced in said cavity, becomes approximately oval and takes folds which disturb the uniform distribution of the spermicid substance which is generally used with the diaphragm. accordingly, it is an object of the invention to overcome the prior-art disadvantages. a more particular object of the invention is to provide a va final diaphragm of safer and easier use as well as a diaphragms which allows to manufacture a reduced number of different sizes to meet the requirements of any user. the invented diaphragm comprises a spring, alternatively of circular or oval cross section, which houses a bendable shaperetaining armour capable of being deformed easily by the fin gers so as to adjust the plan shape and dimensions of the diaphragm; the dome is

claims:   1. vaginal diaphragm consisting of a dome made of elastome ric material which is joined to a peripherical closed coil spring housing a bendable shape-retaining armour characterized in that a peripherical structure (3) of oval shape is straddley by a dome (2) of oval periphery, two bendable shaperetaining arched sections (8, 9) housed in a closed coil spring (4) incorporated in the peripherical structure (3) are bent according to said oval shape, said arched sections (8,9) being such that they may be deformed by the fingers in order to adjust to the specific requirement the length of a selected diaphragm; in that the dome (2) is joined to the inner part of the peripherical structure (3) at the level of the mid-plane   (x-m)    of the diaphragm (1); in tat the cross section of the peripherical structure (3) is substantially circular shaped.   2. vaginal diaphragm according to claim 1 characterized in that the cross section of the peripherical structure (3) is substantially oval shaped and the major axis of this oval section is perpendicular to said mid-plane (m-m).   3. vaginal diaphragm consisting of a dome of elastomeric material which is joined to a peripherical closed coil spring housing a bendable shape-retaining armour characterized in that a peripherical structure (3) of circular shape straddled by a dome (2') of circular periphery and incorporating a closed coil spring (4') houses a circular armour consisting of a bendable shape-retaining section (8') of flat cross section the ends of which face each other; in that the dome   (2') is joined to the inner part of the peripherical structure (3') at the level of the mid-plane   (m-x)    of the diphragm (1'); in that the cross section of the peripherical structure (3') is substantially oval shaped and the major axis of this oval section is perpendicular to the mid-plane (m-m) of the diaphragm (1').    4. vaginal diaphragm according to claim 3 characterized in that the ends of the bendable shape-retaining circular section (8') of flat cross section overlap one another circumfe rentially.
