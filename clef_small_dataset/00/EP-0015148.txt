<ABSTRACT>
solar conversion apparatus is disclosed.  the solar conversion apparatus comprises concentrating means (2) concentrating solar energy onto at least one surface of a heat transfer conduit (4), tracking means for causing the concentrating means to track the sun, the tracking means including radiation sensitive elements (44, 46) which are operable on differential thermal expansion thereof to generate tracking control signals, and an electric motor (34) for moving the concentrating means, the motor being responsive to the said control signals.  tracking movement is thus initiated by thermal radiation but it is arrested by photo-cells (90-96) which react with relatively short response time.

<DESCRIPTION>
servo-controllfd solar tracking apparatus this invention relates to solar conversion apparatus particularly apparatus which is arranged to track the sun and concentrate the sun's energy onto a surface which is in contact with a heat transfer medium. there are many examples of energy conversion apparatuses of the type noted above but most suffer from the defect of inaccurate tracking which has an adverse effect on the efficiency of operation. the general object of the invention is to provide a concentrating apparatus which is of relatively simple construction and which tracks accurately and reliably. according to the present invention there is provided solar conversion apparatus comprising concentrating means for concentrating solar energy onto at least one surface, tracking means for causing the concentrating means to track the sun, said tracking means including radiation sensitive elements which are operable on differential thermal expansion thereof to generate tracking control signals and an electric motor for moving said concentrating means, said motor being responsive to said control signals. preferably said radiation sensitive elements have a predetermined response time during which they are subjected to radiation before said control signals are generated for initiating movement of said motor, said tracking means including arresting means for arresting movement of said motor when the concentrating means is concentrating solar energy onto said surface, said arresting means having a response time which is shorter than that of said radiation sensitive elements. preferably further, the radiation sensitive elements comprise thermally expansible metallic tapes which function in an analogous manner to those included in the apparatus disclosed in australian patent application no. 35176/78 lodged april 17, 1978. the arresting means may comprise at least one photo-cell. the apparatus defined above has many advantages. one particular advantage is the fact that tracking movements are initiated by concentrated solar energy falling onto the expandible tapes. this almost entirely removes the possibility of the tracking system being subject to stray light which has been found to be a problem with systems which rely simply on photo-electric cells for tracking signals. further, the apparatus of the invention utilizes a photo-cell to arrest movement of the concentrating means and this has the particular advantage that it can be made to have a very short response time so that the concentrating means is stopped right at the instant in which it is correctly directed at the sun. further, the photo-cell or cells can be arranged to be responsive only to concentrated solar energy from the concentrating means itself thereby further eliminating the possibility of stray signals affecting the tracking operation of the apparatus. the invention also provides a novel trough construction which results in parabolic trough of very accurate shape which is also of importance in achieving efficient operation of the conversion apparatus. the invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a perspective view of a solar energy conversion apparatus construction in accordance with the invention; figure 2 is a schematic longitudinal cross section; figure 3
