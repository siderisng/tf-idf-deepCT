<ABSTRACT>
the invention is concerned with a continuously variable  transmission mechanism which incorporates a variator (10)  and an epicyclic gearset (18, 19, 20).  several brakes and/or  clutches (17, 28, 29, 25, 27) are arranged for selectively  coupling together or holding stationary various parts of the  mechanism to provide forward and reverse transmission  ranges within which the overall transmission ratio can be  varied by the variator (10).  in a first mode of operation the  drive is through the variator (10), the epicyclic gearset (18,  19, 20) acting as a reduction gearing and a further reduction  gearing (22, 23, 24) to an output co-axial with the input.  in a  second mode, the gearset (18, 19, 20) is locked up to provide  direct drive from the variator (10) output to the reduction  drive (22, 23, 24).  the ratio of the reduction drive corresponds  to the maximum step-up ratio of the variator so that in  the second mode, with maximum variator step up ratio the  overall transmission ratio is 1:1 in a third mode the input  (14) is coupled (17) directly to the output (16) to bypass the  variator and provide direct drive.  the epicyclic gearset can  be used in a reverse mode to provide a reverse gear.
