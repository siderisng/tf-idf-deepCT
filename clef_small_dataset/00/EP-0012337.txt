<ABSTRACT>
a dual purpose suction cleaning apparatus includes  an open-topped container (10) adapted for the collection of  a liquid and a motor driven air suction unit (20) for apply­ ing suction to the container (10).  in use, either a detach­ able reservoir unit (50), or a detachable connector member  (80) is interposed between the air suction unit (20) and the  container (10) so that in the one case the apparatus serves  as a water extraction cleaner, whereas in the other case it  operates as a normal dry vacuum cleaner.  the inter-chan­ geable reservoir unit (50) and connector member (80) are  each formed as self-contained units by means of which the  exhaust air flow from the suction unit is directed by the re­ servoir unit (50) so as to displace liquid therefrom, but is  diverted to atmosphere by the connector member (80).  a  filter element (84) for dry dust collection may be incorpo­ rated in the connector member (80) or a separate dust col­ lecting bag may be provided in the container.
