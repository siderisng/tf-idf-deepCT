<ABSTRACT>
a cassette for banknotes and like valuable articles is  provided with a displaceable lid (6) and locking means (10) for  latching the lid of the cassette when the cassette is located  outside a housing (25) in which it is intended to be placed.  an  operating means (8) is arranged to co-act with the locking  means and with a latching element (15).  the latching element is  arranged to be released in dependence upon a pre-set program.   a signal circuit is arranged to send a code signal to a detector  circuit (23) when electrical contact elements on the cassette and  the housing co-act with one another, which detector circuit,  when the signal coincides with the signal program in the detector  circuit, causes a signal to be sent for moving the latching means  to a non-latching position.
