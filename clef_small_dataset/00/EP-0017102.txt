<ABSTRACT>
a drug combination for more effective treatment of pain  and inflammation comprising (a) a halogenated phenyl  benzoic acid compound and (b) acetaminophen.  the com­ bination exhibits more rapid onset of action and more  extended action, and provides more safety and fewer side  effects than either ingredient alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention composition containing a phenyl benzoic acid compound and acetaminophen combination for the treatment of pain and inflammation and process for preparing the same background of the invention: field of the invention: the present invention relates to a novel drug combination for more effective treatment of pain and in flammation. particularly, the present invention is concerned with the combination of (a) a phenyl benzoic acid compound and (b) acetaminophen. pain, along with erythema and edema, is one of the three major symptoms of acute inflammation. further, it is known that pain, inflammation, and prostaglandins are interrelated. it is currently believed that prostaglandins (pgs) are released peripherally at a site of local inflammation, and act to sensitize pain receptors to the action of pain-inducing mediators, whatever their origin. not only the primary prostaglandins (pge2 and pge2), but the endoperoxide intermediates (pgg2 and pgh2) as well, are involved. in fact, all of the oxygenation products resulting from the interaction of arachidonic acid (aa) with prostaglandin synthetase (cyclo-oxygenase) must be considered potential pain-inducing agents. thus, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (nsai) have analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity due to their ability to depress the synthesis of prostaglandins by acting on the cyclo-oxygenase. it is also currently believed that a destructive free radical oxidant released in the conversion of pgg2 to pgh2 plays a causal role in inflammatory processes, as well as in pain. the phenyl benzoic acid compounds of the drug combination of the present invention are gooa prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and have a slight ability to neutralize the destructive oxidant as well. acetaminophen, on the other hand, while it has no significant cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, is a potent scavenger of the oxidative radical. surprisingly, the novel drug combination of the present invention possesses improved analgesia in the form of both more rapid onset of action, as well as in prolonged action. reference is made to the following for a more detailed discussion of the above principles: kuehle and egan, "prostaglandins and related mediators in pain", xiv congress of rheumatology, san francisco, california, june 29, 1977; and kuehl et al. biochemical aspects of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, academic press, pp. 5574 (1977). brief description of the prior art the phenyl benzoic acid compounds employed in the present invention are known analgesic and anti-inflammatory compounds. see u.s. patent nos. 3,674,870 and 3,714,226. and, acetaminophen is a known analgesic agent. however, the combination is novel and the more effective treatment of pain and inflammation obtained therewith was wholly unexpected. acetaminophen esters of phenyl benzoic acid compounds, useful as analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents, are also known. see u.s. patent no. 3,892,769. however, these esters represent 1:1 molar ratios of the phenyl benzoic acid and acetaminophen components of the basic molecule; whereas, in the physical mixture combination of the present invention, the acetaminophen is re wired to be present in several times the amount of the phenyl benzoic acid compound employed. a eutectic mixture consisting of 63% aspirin and 37% acetaminophen is described in japanese
