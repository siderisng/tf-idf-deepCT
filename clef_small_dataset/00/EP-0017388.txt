<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle seat (10) having a rigid rail frame (22) and a  crash pad which is vandal proof and inexpensive.  a seat back  (12) formed of a sheet of flexible material having a high  surface hardness is mounted on the rigid rail frame.  the top  portion of the seat back includes an integrally formed flexible  energy absorbing bubble (15).  the energy absorbing bubble  extends substantially the length of the seat back and is  disposed at the top of the seat back for cushioning the impact  of a passenger's head during an impact or rapid manoeuvre.   the energy absorbing bubble can encompass a flexible  energy absorbing brace (29), having an l-shaped cross  section, that is cantilevered from the rigid rail frame.
