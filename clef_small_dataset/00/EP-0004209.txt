<ABSTRACT>
1.  a compound inlet valve for a steam turbine, including a number of valves in coaxial succession, actuated by the lifting of a valve stem (7), the steam inlet area increasing from one valve to the next in the direction of lift of the valve stem, the first valve which ensures a first steam inlet (11-12) consisting of a first valve-disc (11) carried by the stem (7) and of a first seating (12) on a slider piece (2) arranged in a cylindrical portion provided with lateral orifices (20) for the steam flow, the slider piece (2) having a necked upstream area enabling raising of it by the valve-disc (11), the down-stream portion of the slider piece (2) forming the valve-disc of a second valve which ensures a second stream inlet (14), the inlets (11-12, 14) opening one after another from upstream towards downstream in proportion as the valve stem lifts, characterized in that the valve may include more than two steam inlets (11-12, 14, 15), a number of slider pieces (2, 3), being mounted telescopically over one another in the cylindrical portion, the latter being pierced with orifices (20, 21, 22) arranged respectively at the height of each of the inlets (11-12, 14, 15) in such a way that the orifices (20, 21) are shut off in succession from upstream to downstream by the said slider pieces (2, 3) in conformity with the opening of the next inlet in proportion as the valve stem (7) lifts.
