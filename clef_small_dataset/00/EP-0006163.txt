<ABSTRACT>
In a process for flue gas guide in a heat boiler (1), the flux gases leaving the combustion chamber are divided into a plurality of partial streams, passed through differently high-acting cooling lines and generated here by merging a gas stream of a mixed temperature controlled, depending on a pre-existing control variable becomes. In addition to a conventional operation of the boiler as a heat generator at the same time even the removal of flue gas of arbitrary temperature between about 500 ° C and about 900 ° C in great economy and stable burning conditions to enable, the temperature of the gas stream depending on the needs of a Upstream-swapped flue gas consumption (16) controlled and the pressure of the gas stream was kept substantially constant, wherein the non-smoked flue gas consumption (16) fused flue gas components are still used for heat recovery in the heat boiler (1). In a thermal boiler for carrying out a sol chen method, all flue gas trains (7, 8) passing from the combustion chamber (3) lead to a flue gas collector chamber (9), wherein the outlet cross sections of the smoke gas trains (7, 8) are changeable. A device (13, 14, 19) for adjusting the pressure in the flue gas collecting chamber (9) is provided, from which of the mixed flue gases, for a downstream consumer (16), to another over a last cooling distance (10) to be supplied to an exhaust gas fireplace (11).
