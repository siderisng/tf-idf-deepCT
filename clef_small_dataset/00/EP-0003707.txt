<ABSTRACT>
this device comprises a u-shaped stirrup (3), in which is mounted an axle (5) passing through a rotary clamping cam with two identical plates (7a), (7b) which are independent or mutually fixed and which crush onto the wings of the sections an interposed pin made of round iron (25).  the double cam can execute a rotation equal to the distance between the stirrup (3) and the stops (14) welded to the wings of the section (1), this distance being preset by means of an elastomer (26) which is compressed as a result of the rotation of the plates, the initial clamping being produced by a jack (21), the piston (23) of which bears on the section (1) and the body of which catches on the lugs (24a), (24b) of the plates of the double cam.  <image>
