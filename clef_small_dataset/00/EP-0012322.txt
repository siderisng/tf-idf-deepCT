<ABSTRACT>
A molded body with balls embedded in metallic bedding composition as a splinter body for projectiles is expensive in production by sintering. Cold round kneading is a cost-effective production. In addition, a substantial increase in the splitter energy is achieved in the detonation of the molded body. In a hollow space between a base body (3; 11) and one on Senh端lse (10), the balls (12) are introduced prior to the machining operation. The cutting-release machining by cold rotary kneading of the outer sleeve presses the material of the base body and the outer sleeve between the Ku gel cavities, compresses the base body and the outer sleeve, braced the outer sleeve and the balls. As a result, the one of the base body can be very thin in nene sleeve. The bias of the balls and the outer sleeve gives together with the thin inside sleeve a high energy transfer from the explosive to the sleeve splitter and the balls.
