<ABSTRACT>
in apparatus for emergency cooling of a steam  generator unit (1) of a nuclear power plant wherein blow-off  steam is condensed in a closed circuit and the resulting condensate  is returned to the steam generator as feed water, the  steam is passed through a blow-off pipe (11) into a closed  vessel (14) comprising a water space (12) and a gas space  (13).  a bundle of heat exchanger tubes (15) extends through  the vessel (14).  an end part of the blow-off pipe (11) extending  into the water space (12) is angularly bent and is  designed as a steam distributor nozzle (18) which is arranged  opposite to the bundle of heat exchanger tubes (15).  the  thermo-syphon effect and hence the efficiency of the  apparatus are increased with this arrangement so that the  amount of steam blown off can be taken up in a relatively  small vessel.
