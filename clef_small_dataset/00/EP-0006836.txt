<ABSTRACT>
a ball valve structure has a removable upper cover  plate (16) to permit the ball (34) to be removed from the  valve body.  a separate cam tool (90, figs.  8-10) after remo­ val of the cover plate is positioned within the bore of the  ball which has been partially rotated from the full open  position, and upon a return rotation of the ball with the  cam tool therein to a full open position an adjacent spring  urged seat ring (58) is cammed away from the ball to a re­ tracted position.  a seat ring retainer (82) is then actuated  to hold the seat ring in the retracted position.  the cam tool  is then utilized in a similar manner to cam the other oppo­ site seat ring in retracted position.  the ball may then be  removed with the seat rings for replacement or repair as  desired.  the seat rings and seals (70) thereon may be re­ moved and replaced in such a manner without removal  of the valve from the flowline in which the valve is posi­ tioned.
