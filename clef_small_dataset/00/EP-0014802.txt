<ABSTRACT>
a liquid phase chemical process carried out in the pres­ ence of solid particles of supported or unsupported catalyst  comprising a magnetic or magnetisable metal, for example a  ferromagnetic metal such as raney nickel, wherein at the end  of the process, which may be batch or continuous, the catalyst  particles in the liquid reaction mixture are magnetically floc­ culated by application of a magnetic field using electro mag­ net (15) (either continuously or intermittently) the flocculated  particles allowed to settle to the bottom of the process reactor  and the supernatant liquid withdrawn from the reactor leav­ ing the flocculated catalyst particles in situ in the reactor for  further use.  the process enables equipment usually supplied  external to the process reactor for separation of the catalyst  from the reaction mixture to be dispensed with, and catalyst  life is increased.  the process has applicability to a wide range  of reactions in which magnetic catalysts are used, for example  hydrogenations, dehydrogenations etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
catalytic processes the present invention relates to catalytic processes in particular to catalytic processes using supported or unsupported metallic catalysts. the use of metal catalysts extends throughout all branches of the chemical industry. processes in which they are used may be homogeneous or heterogeneous with respect to the catalyst and may take place in the vapour phase or liquid phase it is with this latter type of heterogeneous process that the present invention is concerned. at the end of a liquid phase process using a heterogeneous catalyst the solid catalyst must be separated from the liquid phase. the solid-liquid separation usually poses some difficultiest and usually involves some form of filtration, with or without prior decantation. for example, the catalyst may be allowed to settle under gravity and the liquid reaction products then decanted or filtered from the solid. in some cases, finely divided solid catalysts or catalysts suspended in a reaction medium may settle rather slowly and this can involve a waste of time while settling takes place. in many processes, for example catalytic hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, desulphurisations, the catalyst used is a ferromagnetic material, for example raney nickel, in the form of small particles. where separation of such ferromagnetic catalyst particles from the reaction medium has proved difficult, it has been proposed to use a magnetic filter in the form of a grid or screen, a magnetic field being induced in the grids by an adjacent field coil. the ferromagnetic particles are removed from the liquid reaction medium by causing it to pass-through the grid or screen, the particles being retained on the grid or screen. another proposal for separating difficultly-separable non-magnetic particles from a liquid medium involves the absorption or collection of the non-magnetic particles into or on a suitable added ferromagnetic material and then separating the ferromagnetic material together with the non-magnetic particles which it has collected, -by magnetic filtration. both these proposals have some disadvantages, for example blocking of the grids or screens by collected material in the one case and the necessity to introduce an extra step involving addition of another material which is then immediately removed in the other case. we have now devised a process whereby certain supported or unsupported magnetic or magnetisable metal catalysts may be readily removed from a liquid reaction medium. accordingly, the invention comprises a liquid phase chemical process carried out in a reactor in-the presence of solid particles of a supported or unsupported catalyst comprising a magnetic or magnetisable metal wherein at the end of the process the catalystparticles in the liquid reaction mixture are magnetically flocculated and the flocculated particles-allowed to settle whereby to produce a supernatant liquid phase which is withdrawn from the reactor leaving flocculated and settled catalyst particles-in situ in the reactor. the catalyst may comprise either a magnetic or magnetisable metal and the term "magnetic" is- to be construed as including both classes. thus, the expression comprises both catalysts which are inherently magnetic and catalysts which are capable of being magnetised, at least
