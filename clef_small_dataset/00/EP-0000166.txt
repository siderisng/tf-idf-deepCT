<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a polymerization reaction vessel  having a coating on the inner surfaces thereof resulting  from applying thereto a coating composition containing, as a  primary ingredient, a water-soluble dye dissolved in water.   when polymerizing olefinic monomers, such as vinyl  halides, vinylidene halides, and vinylidene monomers having  at least one terminal châ‚‚ = c< grouping, and mixtures  thereof, in the presence of said coating, polymer buildup on  the inner surfaces of the reaction vessel is substantially  eliminated.  further, multiple charges or batches of polymer  can be made in said internally coated reaction vessel without  opening the same between charges thus preventing the  escape of unreacted monomer to the atmosphere.
