<ABSTRACT>
rotating ring yarn spinning or twisting apparatus  comprises an air-bearing supported, freely rotated spinning  or twisting ring (30) carrying a yarn traveler (42), having  radial and cylindrical air-bearings (48, 52) and an annular  plenum cavity (54) in at least one of the cylindrical air-­ bearing surfaces.  this provides advantages over known  air-bearings in that generally open, unencumbered and  continuous admission pressurized air to the air-bearings  as provided.  the air-bearings communicate through an an­ nularly disposed mutually connecting enlarged air space  (60).  time delay means (82), is provided for reducing the  air supply to the air-bearings at a selected predetermined  time after de-energizing the power drive (80), of the appa­ ratus.  a method of controlling yarn tension during stop-off  of the apparatus includes the steps of maintaining air pres­ sure in the air-bearings after de-energizing the power drive  to the apparatus, continuing to maintain the air pressure  while the apparatus and the freely rotating ring decelerate  for a predetermined time period, and reducing the air pres­ sure at the end of the time period so that the ring decele­ rates more rapidly and stops prior to the remainder of the  apparatus.
