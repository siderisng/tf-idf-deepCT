<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for producing foam using a  static foam generator containing no moving parts at a rate  adequate for commercial needs and possessing properties for  ready and rapid application to and absorption by a substrate  such as a textile fiber or fabric.  the generator comprises a  chamber with an inlet at one end and an outlet at an opposite  end wherein from about 10 to 100 percent of the total volume  of the chamber contains a packing of random fibers or  strands.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and ppapta.tus for producing foam" trl2 prescnt invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing fear.', particularly for the treatment of textile materials. the treatment of textile materials with various chemicals dyestuffs, resins and the like has been long conducted by the use of aqueous baths. in such processes the fabric is essentially saturated by immersion in a after bath containing the treating chemical and eventually the water t be removed in order to continue the processing or to dry the fabric. of the many procedures employed in the past for the treatment of fabrics, the ost commonly employed is the pad-dry process in which the fabric is immersed and saturated with the aqueous treating solution, squeezed between rollers to a given wet pick-up and subsequently dried or dried and cured on a frame or heated drying roll before being taken up in a roll once again. the a amount of water retained by the fabric is normally controlled by the pressure of the squeeze roll; in conventional methods a lower limit of about 50 to 7c per cent water based on the weight of the fabric is still retained, depending upon the particular fabric used. this large amount of water requires a tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat to dry the fabric. it has been estimated that the amount of e.-crgy required to remove the water und dry t.he fabric "any times greater than the amount of energy that is needed in heating the cloth to carry out the desired chemical treating step, such as for example in the application and cure of a wash and wear finis'l on he fabric, or in the continuous dyeing of a fabric tn addition to the pad-dry process, in whizz the water is removed by squeezing between rollers, other procedures hgve recently been developed for more efficient removal of water. in oiie such procedure the saturated fabric is conveyed to a jet squeeer which employs a stream of compressed air jetting outward at the point of contact between the fabric and the nip rolls substantially to reduce the moisture content of the fabric. the use of this technique has resulted in a decrease of the water content in the fabric to about half of that normally remaining when using the squeeze roll technique discussed above. in another procedure vacuum extractor rolls are used. this process entails conveying the wet fabric as it exists from the treating bath over a perforated roll within which a vacuum is created whereby the moisture is extracted from the fabric. in some instances, roller coating methods can be used which continuously deliver aqueous treating composition to the fabric and the add-on is governed by the fabric speed and the rate of delivery of the treating composition by the coating roller. in this procedure the treating composition generally remains predominantly on or near the surface of the fabric, particularly when low add-ons are involved. within the past few years, several new approaches have
