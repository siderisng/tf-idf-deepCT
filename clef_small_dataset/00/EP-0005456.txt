<ABSTRACT>
containers (20a) such as those used for foodstuffs  having a generally frusto-conical initial shape are constrained  into a forming die during the handling of the  containers for injecting quantities of edibles and the like  therein such that the containers (20a) are constrained to  enter a die having a generally square configuration and then,  while still in the die, the containers (20a) are filled with food  or other material and a square lid (50) is fed into position  above the filled container and placed thereon to maintain the  square configuration of the upper end thereof.  the resulting  containers provide a much more efficient packaging for  equal volumes of product when compared with the more  conventional frusto-conical shape containers.  the invention  is particularly well-adapted to packaging ice cream and the  like.
