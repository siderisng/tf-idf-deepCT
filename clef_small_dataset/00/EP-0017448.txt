<ABSTRACT>
a personal portable identifier contains a constant fre­ quency oscillator (16) from which a radiated carrier is  obtained and counters (28-31) for deriving from the oscillator  different frequency signals to modulate (62) the carrier  according to a code peculiar to the identifier.  the code has a  series of bits each selecting a modulating frequency.  the bit  rate is derived from oscillator (16) by a counter/decoder (32,  38) and the modulating frequencies are selected by switch­ ing units (50-55) operated by the decoder that provide a code  sequence including start and stop control bits, identification  data, and a group of bits selectively alterable by the user.   emergency data may also be encoded possibly onto a  separate carrier source (95).  an identification system in­ cludes a receiver for use with a number of identifiers and  including means for decoding each received bit sequence.
