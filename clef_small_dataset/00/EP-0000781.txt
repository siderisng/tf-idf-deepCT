<ABSTRACT>
grid structure for the concealed suspension or fastening of rectangular or possibly square ceiling or wall panels (3), all or some of which are flexible.  to facilitate removal and replacement of these ceiling or wall panels, the grid structure is produced by a first set of parallel bearing profiles (1) and by a second set of parallel bearing profiles (4) running transversely thereto, the ceiling or wall panels engaging in webs (2,6) of the bearing profiles (2,4) by means of grooves (5) formed in their lateral edges, and at least some of the second set of bearing profiles (4) being flexible in one direction.  as a result, it is possible to release the flexible ceiling or wall panels (3), by slight pressure on their centre, from the engagement first with the bearing profiles (2) of the second set and thereafter with the bearing profiles (4) of the first set, and then simply to remove or replace them.  shapes of flexible, stiff-material bearing profiles suitable for this purpose are provided.  <image>
