<ABSTRACT>
a powder dispenser (2) for a washing machine comprises  a pre-wash compartment (6) and a wash compartment (8)  each provided with a door (10 or 12) which is opened when  the powder in the compartment is required.  opening of both  doors (10 and 12) is achieved by operating a single solenoid  (63), a selector mechanism (66) being provided to determine  which door is to be opened.  in a preferred embodiment, the  selector mechanism (66) is moved to a first position, in which  the solenoid (63) is operable to open the pre-wash compartment  door (10), in response to the closing of this door (10).   on the opening of this door (10), the selector mechanism (66)  is caused to move to a second position in which the solenoid  (63) is operable to open the wash compartment door (12).
