<ABSTRACT>
an ultraviolet light sensitive polymer composition  wherein resistance to photodegradation is enhanced by the  addition thereto of a mixture containing at least one substituted  decahydroquinoline compound and at least one  uv absorbing compound selected from the group consisting  of benzotriazoles, benzoates and nickel phenolate complexes.   this invention is also directed to methods enhancing  the resistance of ultraviolet light sensitive polymers to  photodegradation.
