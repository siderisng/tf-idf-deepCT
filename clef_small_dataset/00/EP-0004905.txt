<ABSTRACT>
a programmable automatic controller for operating a  section of a glassware forming machine having a plurality of  components which operate in a timed or sequential relationship  with one another.  the controller includes a timing  means (100) for generating a digital signal in synchronism  with the operation of the machine, wherein the digital signal  provides an instantaneous indication of the time elapsed in  each cycle of operation of the machine.  a random access  memory (ram) stores the status of every section component  at each increment of time during each cycle of machine  operation.  the digital signal addresses the ram so that the  statuses of all components for the corresponding time are  directed to drivers which provide component enable or  inhibit command signals.  control means for adjusting the actuation and deactuation  times of the section components provide information to  a computer (102) which updates an internal memory table  organized similarly to the ram.  the computer (102) also  controls the transfer of data from the internal table to the  ram in such a way that the data updating speed of the  control computer is independent of the machine cycle speed.
