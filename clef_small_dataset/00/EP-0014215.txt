<ABSTRACT>
a direction finder comprising directional loop antennas  which are arranged to intersect at right angles, and a non-­ directional vertical antenna.  in the prior art, the loop antenna  system and vertical antenna system are different in line con­ stant from each other so that it is impossible to compose  together the voltage signals induced in the loop antennas and  vertical antenna in the in-phase or anti-phase relationship  with each other, thus resulting in that it is very difficult to  determine with accuracy the directions of arrival signals.  according to this invention, the voltage signals induced in the  loop antennas and vertical antenna may be suitably com­ posed with each other to deliver for each of the loop antennas  the in-phase or anti-phase composite voltage signals which  are in the anti-phase relationship with each other.  a driving  signal for a display device is thus generated on the basis of  both of the voltage signal induced in and detected by the  vertical antenna and suitably-selected any one of the detected  composite signals, whereby the determined direction is  reduced in error.
