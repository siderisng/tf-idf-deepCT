<ABSTRACT>
a set of travelling line guiding members (34-36) are  moved relative to stationary line guiding members (30-32)  with the two sets of line guiding members containing sepa­ rate individual wraps of partial loops of line.  by moving the  guiding members relatively toward and away from one  another the line (39) can be quickly released when letting out  line or retrieved for retracting a line.  wrap retaining devices  are provided for releasably holding the wraps of line when in  the retracted position after the movable line guiding mem­ bers are moved from the retracted position toward the fixed  line guiding members.
