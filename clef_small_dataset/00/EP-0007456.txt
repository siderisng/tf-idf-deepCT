<ABSTRACT>
In a data bit translator for a matrix printer, a plurality of pressure elements (13) by control signals is individually controllable. In order to be removed from the data translator the data bits in a sequence differing, compared to the input, for each pressure element (13), a memory cell is provided, which are arranged matrix-shaped, wherein for an optional parallel storage, the rows of the matrix are addressable . The memory cells can be activated for a serial reading within each matrix series. The individual matrix rows are readily readable. For a parallel recording of data bits, a buffer (22) is provided with a plurality of memory pastries. Between the buffer (22) and the memory cell columns, a readout buffer (21) is geared between and for addressing predetermined matrix rows for successive storage of bits of bits is provided an addressing encoding circuit (25) and a memory address register (23). For a serial reading of data bits within the matrix rows and for a successive reading of said matrix series, a control circuit (27) shift registers (28) and holding lock circuits (29) are provided. The data bits serve as control signals for the respective pressure elements (13).
