<ABSTRACT>
an hydraulic system for actuating a swing-post  mounted backhoe boom (19) comprises two double-acting  hydraulic cylinders (17, 18) operated by a control valve  (35).  as the backhoe boom (19) swings into a swing stop,  hydraulic fluid is trapped in the head end (28) of the swing  side cylinder.  this trapped fluid is discharged through a  cylinder relief valve (47), thus absorbing the boom kinetic  energy and providing a smooth deceleration of the boom.   fluid discharged from the relief valve (47) is routed to the  rod end of the swing cylinder and the head end of the  opposite cylinder.  because of the swing linkage geometry,  the cylinder rod (30) of the other cylinder had passed over  the pivot axis (16) about which the backhoe boom (19) was  swinging and thus the piston (29) of the other cylinder was  caused to move in the same direction as the swing side  piston (29).  the movement of this piston can be utilized to  provide additional deceleration torque as long as no void­ ing is permitted to occur in the head end of this other  cylinder.  voiding only occurs when the backhoe swing con­ trol lever (38) is released prior to the backhoe boom reach­ ing the swing stop.  voiding does not occur when the con­ trol lever (38) is maintained in a full power-on or is stroked  in the power-on mode until the swing stop is contacted.   fluid from the swing side cylinder relief valve is routed to  provide the necessary fluid to prevent such voiding.  the  routing of the fluid from the swing cylinder to the other  cylinder assures that the boom deceleration is independent  of whether the control lever is stroked or released.
