<ABSTRACT>
a radio receiver comprising a radio-frequency amplifier  (1) for amplifying transmitted radio-frequency signals of a  selected frequency detected by an aerial (3); an oscillator (5)  for producing an oscillator signal of a frequency differing from  the frequency of the selected radio-frequency signals; a mixer  (4) for mixing the oxcillator signal with the radio-frequency  signal to produce an intermediate-frequency signal; an  intermediate-frequency amplifier (10) for amplifying the  signal from the mixer (4); and a detector (11) for producing  audio-frequency signals from the amplified signal from the  mixer (4); the intermediate-frequency amplifier (10) is  arranged to amplify transmitted radio-frequency signals at  the intermediate frequency which have not been amplified by  the radio frequency amplifier (1), and in that means is pro­ vided for stopping and starting the supply of intermediate-­ frequency signals derived form the radio-frequency amplifier  (1) to the intermediate-frequency amplifier (10) in response to  a predetermined radio-frequency signal transmitted at the  intermediate frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification title radio receiver. this invention relstes to radio receivers. a conventional radio receiver comprises a radio frequency amplifier which is arranged to amplify transmitted radio frequency signals of a selected frequency detected by an aerial; an oscillator for producing an oscillator signal of a frequency differing from the frequency of the selected radio frequency signal by a predetermined amount; a mixer for mixing the oscillator signal with the radio frequency signal to produce an intermediate frequency signal derived from the radio frequency amplifier; an intermediate frequency amplifier for amplifying the said intermediate frequency signal; and a detector for producing an audio frequency signal from the amplified intermediate frequency signal. in order to avoid interference between transmitted radio frequency signals and the intermediate frequency signals1 the radio receiver must be tuned to produce an intermediate frequency signal different from any transmitted radio signals. under international agreements1 broad casting authorities refrain from broadcasting on selected radio frequencies so that these frequencies can be used by radio manufacturers as the intermediate frequency of the radio receiver. thus, for example, in the united kingdom, all radio receivers operate on an intermediate frequency signal of 465 kw7.. in such radio receiverst the radio frequency amplifier must be re-tuned to a different frequency when it is desired to receive a transmisaion by a different broadcasting station. in a motor vehicle a driver my be compelled to re-tune the receiver several times during a long journey particularly if he wishes to obtain such information as local weather or traffic conditions which would be broadcast only on short-range radio transmitters. in a broadcasting system described in wireless world", january 1971 pp 78, transmissions from short-range transmitters relating to purely local information would all be broadcast on a single radio frequency1 e.g. 526.5 khz, so that the driver of a vehicle could receive local information without re-tuning the radio receiver during his journey. each broadcast would oonmence and terminate with a signal which could be used to trigger a suitable switching circuit within a receiver so that the receiver would automatically switch itself to the frequency on which tle local ini.t'ratòn .as being broadcas@, an object of the pr@@ent nt invention ie therefore to provide a radio receiver which becomes @@@omatically switched to re sive a trahsmission on a desired radio fre @@ancy in response to a predetermined radio frequency signal on that fre according to the present invention, we provide a radio receiver comprising a radio-frequency amplifier for amplifying tran±mitted radio 't4çency signals of a selected frequency detected by an aerial; an oscillator for producing an oscillator signal of a frequency differing from the frequency of the selected radio-frequency signals by a predetermined amount; a mixer for mixing the oscillator signal with the radio-frequency signal to produce an intermediate-frequency signal derived from the radio frequency amplifier; an intermediate-frequency amplifier for amplifying the signal from the mixer; and a detector for producing audio-frequency signals from the amplified signal from the mixer; characterised in that the intermediate-frequency amplifier is
