<ABSTRACT>
a very large-scale integration (vlsi) semiconductor cirÂ­ cuit is disclosed.  the vlsi semiconductor circuit is fabricated  based on two conditions.  a first condition thereof is to divide  functionally and physically the vlsi semiconductor circuit  into a plurality of functional blocks.  a second condition  thereof is to employ high power output driving means in each  functional block at the output stages thereof.  the functional  blocks are connected with each other by means of distributing  lines via respective high power output driving means.

<DESCRIPTION>
very large-scale integration set4iconductor circuit the present invention relates to a very large-scale integration semiconductor circuit, and more particularly relates to a very large-scale integration semiconductor system which may preferably be employed in a big computer system. a commonly used large-scale integration (lsi) circuit is fabricated as a single silicon chip having the size of 5 through 10 mms square. however, in a future computer system, a very large-scale integration (vlsi) circuit adapted to a big computer system including a multi-computer system, will be commonly used. in this case, the vlsi circuit may be fabricated as a single silicon chip having the size of 20 through 30 mms square. in view of the architecture for designing the lsi circuit, when the circuit is constructed by a conventional lsi circuit including no more than several thousands of logic gates the amount of information for the design is relatively small. this is because the information contains only the information for designing the logic circuit arrangement so as to obtain the desired logic operation. however, when the circuit is constructed with the vlsi circuit including more than several ten thousands of logic gates, the amount of information for the design becomes considerably large. this is because the information must contain not only the information for designing the logic circuit arrangement so as to obtain the desired logic operation, but also the information for designing a layout of a great number of the logic circuits to be distributed in the single silicon chip. above all, the latter information for designing the layout of the logic circuits is very important information in view of the architecture for designing the vlsi circuit. the reason for the above mentioned fact is as follows. generally, the delay of time for transferring each data signal depends on the length of the respective distributing line on which the data signal is transferred, because the delay of time is proportional mainly to the length of the distributing line due to the presence of the stray capacity created along the distributing line. in the vlsi circuit, since the distributing lines are mounted on and inside the very wide surface of the single silicon chip, the difference between the length of a long distributing line and the length of a short distributing line becomes a very large value, such as, for example several tens mms. therefore, the difference between the delay of time regarding the data signal transferred on the long distributing line and the delay of tine regarding the data signal transferred on the short distributing line is great. consequently, the characteristics of the vlsi circuit to be fabricated are strongly dependent upon the location of each logic circuit on the surface of the single silicon chip. in other words, the characteristics of the vlsi circuit vary in accordance with the layout of a great number of the logic circuits. this is the reason why the information for designing the layout is very important information. however, since there are a great number
