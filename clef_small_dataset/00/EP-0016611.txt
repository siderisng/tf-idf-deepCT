<ABSTRACT>
there are disclosed new biological active polypeptides:   a-x-b   wherein a is deamino-lys or lys; x is a suitable neutral  aliphatic amino acid residue; e. g. , one selected from the  group consisting of ser, ala, 2-me-ala, gly, leu, thr,  d-ser, d-ala, d-thr, allo-thr, d-leu, and sar; b is  gln-r′, decarboxy-gln, or    r′ is a substituent which does not substantially affect the  biological activity of the tripeptide.  these polypeptides have the capability of inducing the  differentiation of t-lymphocytes as measured by the acquisi­ tion of the thymic differentiation antigen th-l, as well as  b-lymphocytes as measured by the acquisition of the  differentiation antigen bu-l.  the polypeptides are thus useful  in thymic function and immunity areas such as in treatment  for congenital absence of thymus.  also provided are ther­ apeutic compositions and methods for use of the polypep­ tides.
