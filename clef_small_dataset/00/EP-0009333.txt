<ABSTRACT>
first and second legs (4 and 5) of a collapsible tripod  (1) are pivoted to a third leg (6) and interconnected by  two interpivoted bracing links (15 and 16).  to swing the first and second legs (4 and 5) towards  and away from the third leg (6), first and second tie mem­ bers (24 and 25) extend, respectively, from the first and  second legs (4 and 5) to an actuating member (18) which  is movable longitudinally of the third leg (6).  to prevent relative movement between the legs (4, 5  and 6); when the tripod (1) is in its extended condition,  a control link (32) extends from the pivotal interconnec­ tion between the two bracing links (15 and 16) and the  actuating member (18) and locking means (21) are pro­ vided for releasably locking the actuating means (18) to  the third leg (6).
