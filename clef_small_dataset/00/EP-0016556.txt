<ABSTRACT>
a vehicle suspension seat has a back rest (6) guided for  vertical movement relative to a base part (1), a seat rest (5)  hinged to the back rest (6) and guided for movement such that  the body of the seat occupant swings about an axis through  his ankles at i8. 1.  an armrest (11) is mounted for movement  relative to the back rest (6) and seat rest (15), so as to minimise  movement of the seat occupant's arm relative to a steering  wheel, by pivotally supporting the armrest (11) about the  instantaneous centres of rotation of the armrest relative to  two parts of the seat which move pivotally with respect to  each other in response to vertical movement of the back rest,  e. g.  centres i10. 7 and i10. 6.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in and relating to suspension seats for vehicles this invention relates to a suspension seat for a vehicle, and more particularly to a suspension seat having arm-rests for the arms of a seat occupant. the main characteristic of a suspension seat is that it comprises a seat part (including a seat rest and a back rest) which is mounted on a spring suspension for upward and downward resilient movement relative to a base part of the seat, the latter being fixed to the floor of the vehicle cab. consequently, when such a seat is occupied by the driver of the vehicle, his arms will rock as his body is raised or lowered relatively to the steering wheel or other hand controls of the vehicle. if armrests are provided, these should move in such a way that support is given to the driver's arms without detracting from his control of the vehicle. if such armrests are merely fixed to the seat rest or back rest, the required support will not be achieved. according to the present invention there is provided a vehicle seat comprising a seat part, which includes a seat rest pivotally connected to a back rest, a base part, a suspension guiding the back rest for substantially vertical upward and downward movement, a spring for counterbalancing the seat part and seat occupant and an armrest, on at least one side of the seat, located to support the lower arm of a vehicle driver when grasping a steering wheel or other control, characterised in that the suspension is operable to guide the seat rest for movement relatively to the back rest and the base part such that the body of the seat occupant swings about a horizontal axis through his ankles, and armrest support mount, the armrest on the seat part for movement about horizontal transverse axes through at least two instantaneous centres of rotation of the armrest about parts of the seat which move pivotally with respect to each other during said upward and downward movement. such instantaneous centres are determined from the knowledge that the driver's lower arm must be rotated about its point of connection with the hand control, and therefore the armrest must be rotated about this point. the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing in which the single figure shows diagrammatically a side view of a vehicle seat in accordance with the invention, with particular reference to the mounting of the armrest and movement of the armrest relative to other parts of the seat. the other side of the seat corresponds to that shown in the drawing, although the armrest and its supporting structure can be omitted on one side of the seat. the details of the construction of the seat, apart from the means for supporting the armrest, form no part of the present invention, but it is to be assumed that the seat is a suspension seat, and constructed in accordance with the

 claims   1. a vehicle seat comprising a seat part, which includes a seat rest pivotally connected to a back rest, a base part, a suspension guiding the back rest for substantially vertical upward and downward movement, a spring for counter-balancing the seat part and seat occupant and an armrest, on at least-one side of the seat, located to support the lower arm of a vehicle driver when grasping a steering wheel or other control, characterised in that the suspension (2-5 and 21) is operable to guide the seat rest (5) for movement relatively to the back rest (6) and the base part (1) such that the body of the seat occupant swings about a horizontal axis (a) through his ankles, and armrest support (14,15) mount,  the armrest (11) on the seat part (5,6) for movement about horizontal transverse axes through at least two instantaneous centres of rotation of the armrest about parts of the seat which move pivotally with respect to each other during said upward and downward movement (e.g.   i7 1    and   ill 7).      2. a vehicle seat according to claim 1 characterised in that said parts of the seat which move pivotally with respect to each other are the seat rest (5) and the back rest (6).   3. a vehicle seat comprising a seat part, which includes a seat rest pivotally connected to a back rest, a base part, a suspension guiding the back rest for substantially vertical upward or downward movement relative to the base part, a spring for counterbalancing the seat part and the seat occupant, and an armrest, on at least one side of the seat, located to support the lower arm of a vehicle  driver when grasping a steering wheel, characterised by means (3-5) guiding the seat rest for movement relative to the back rest (6) and to the base part (1) such that the body of the seat occupant swings about a horizontal axis (a) through his ankles, the armrest (11) having a first pivotal connection (16) at its forward end on a link (15) pivoted at its opposite end to a point (17) on the seat rest (5) below said first pivotal connection,   and the armrest having a second pivotal connection (13) above its rearward end on a member (14) supported by the back rest (6) and at a point substantially midway along the upper arm of the seat occupant.
