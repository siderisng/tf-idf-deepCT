<ABSTRACT>
a support block (20) and a guide member (22) having a  seat (24) to carry a watch (25) to be examined are attached to a  post (18) at a vertical space from each other, the post being set  up inside an airtight container (10) which is pressurized or  decompressed.  a light emitting element (31) and a light  receiving element (32) are embedded in the support block (20)  so as to face each other with a vertical gap (28) inbetween.   inside a cavity (29) adjoining the gap in the block, there are a  screening plate (38) vertically projected in the gap and a  contact member (39) solidly fixed to the plate.  in a test, a  needle-shaped bottom end portion of the contact member is  brought in contact with the watch to be examined, the  screening plate is moved by a distortion of the watch  accompanying a change of the pressure inside the container,  thereby restricting a luminous flux from the light emitting  element, and the change of the luminous flux is converted into  a change of photoelectric current and displayed visually.
