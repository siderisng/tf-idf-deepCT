<ABSTRACT>
a composite, neutron absorbing, coated article, normally  flat and thin and of comparatively light weight, suitable for  installation in storage racks for spent nuclear fuel and for  other neutron absorbing applications, includes a backing  member, preferably of flexible material such as woven  fiberglass cloth, a synthetic organic polymeric coating or a  plurality of such coatings on the backing member, preferably  of cured phenolic resin, such as phenol formaldehyde or  trimethylolphenol formaldehyde and boron carbide particles  held to the backing member by the cured coating or a  plurality of such coatings.  also within the invention is a  method for the manufacture of the neutron absorbing coated  article and the use of such an article.  in a preferred method  the backing member is first coated on both sides thereof with  a filling coating of thermosettable liquid phenolic resin,  which is then partially cured to solid state, one side of the  backing member is then coated with a mixture of thermosettable  liquid resin and finely divided boron carbide particles  and the resin is partially cured to solid state, the other side is  coated with a similar mixture, larger boron carbide particles  are applied to it and the resin is partially cured to solid state,  such side of the article is coated with thermosettable liquid  phenolic resin, the resin is partially cured to solid state and  such resin, including previously applied partially cured  resins, is cured to final cross-linked and permanently set  form.
