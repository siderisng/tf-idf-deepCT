<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric machine with a rotor in a stationary machine housing containing a superconducting exciter winding and a cylindrical wave end. Around the wave end, a non-rotating connection head part is arranged. Between these components a bearing and a sealant device are provided and a coolant is transferred. The rotor of such a machine performs axial and radial vibrations. If the connecting head is rigidly connected to the machine housing, the sealant device must enable a corresponding game. However, this leads to sealing difficulties. The invention therefore provides a bearing (22; 25) with a low radial game that the connection head part (2) follows the radial disengagement of the wave end piece (3) from its predetermination with respect to a rotation axis (4). The sealing device (29; 30) may then advantageously be a ferrofluidic seal (50 to 52). In particular, a plain bearing is in question as a bearing (22; 25). Accordingly designed terminal head parts can be present for superconducting turbogenerators.
