<ABSTRACT>
This coupler is of the type in which collimation means (10) are interposed between the light source (20) and the transmission line (14).The means (10) compror tears a spherical transparent core (26) having a cer tain refractive index, surrounded by a transpa encase (24), also spherical, and having a refractive index lower than that of the core (26).The conical light beam resulting from the source (20), successively passes the envelope (24), the core (26), then again the envelope (24), which has the effect of concentrating and give it a section.comparable to that of the optical fiber (30) of the line (14).The light source (20) is mounted at the bottom of a cylindrical lodge whose edges are glued to the envelope (24) after it has been oriented so that the fiber (30) receives the maximum of light.
