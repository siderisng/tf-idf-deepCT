<ABSTRACT>
1.  discontinuously operating press for baling loose material with a plunger (3) which is moving to and for in a pressure chamber (2), a feeding device (1, 16) which is delivering the material into the pressure chamber (2) and a sensor (9) for determining the filled condition, which is located in one of the side walls (6) and cooperates with a member which controls both the feeding as well as the pressing of the material, characterized by the fact that the sensor (9) projects into the pressure chamber (2) and is designed as an all-around rod (9) of resilient character which responds to a preset increased pressure head of the material fed into the pressure chamber (2) by means of the feeding device (1, 16) and can be elastically swivelled out of its path of motion by the plunger (3).
