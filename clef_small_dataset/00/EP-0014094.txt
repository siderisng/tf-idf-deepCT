<ABSTRACT>
a pipe coupling for use in a fire-prevention sprinkler sys­ tem comprises a length of pipe (10) and a pipe fitting (11) hav­ ing a socket (12) to receive one end (13) of the pipe.  a first an­ nular recess (16) in the socket receives a sealing ring (15)  which seals the outer periphery of the pipe end.  a second an­ nular recess (17) in the socket cooperates with a locking ring  (14) and with an annular shoulder (20) on the outer periphery  of the pipe end in order to allow entry of the pipe end into the  socket, but thereafter to resist withdrawal of the pipe end from  the socket.  the annular shoulder (20) comprises a ramp which  increases in its radial extent in the direction towards the entry  end (21) of the pipe.  in order to facilitate dis-assembly of the pipe coupling  without the use of special tools, it is preferred that a third annu­ lar recess (24) is provided in the socket in order to receive the  locking ring (14) upon further inward movement of the pipe.   the radial depth of the third recess (24) is greater than that of  the second recess (17) so that the pipe can be withdrawn  thereafter, without there being any engagement between the  locking ring and the annular shoulder.
