<ABSTRACT>
a door lock, in particular a lock for hotel room doors.   actuation of the exterior door handle (10) creates a supply  of compressed air which is directed through a coding as足 sembly (26) to actuate a lock release member (62).  the  operation of the coding assembly is controlled by a pair  of matching punched cards.  one of the cards (42) is nor足 mally positioned within the lock and the other card (44)  is retained by an authorised user for insertion into the lock  to operate the coding assembly.  two separate coding as足 semblies are provided with an hotel door lock, one (58)  being for use by a guest and the other (59) under the con足 trol of the hotel management.
