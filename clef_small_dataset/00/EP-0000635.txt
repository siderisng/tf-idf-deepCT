<ABSTRACT>
a snap action switch blade has two resilient legs (4, 5)  which project from an integral base portion (1) beyond and on  each side of a tongue (3) to which an operating force (p) is  applied.  the legs are joined together by a contact element (8)  which is welded to two inwardly projecting arms (6, 7) at the  free ends of the legs, drawing the latter together to stress the  blade with a dish deformation.  the two inwardly projecting arms (6, 7) may be narrower  than the legs, their common centreline being spaced from the  centre of the contact so that a twisting action is imparted to the  contact prior to its separation from a fixed contact, assisting in  breaking any contact welds.
