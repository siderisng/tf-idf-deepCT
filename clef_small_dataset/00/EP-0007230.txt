<ABSTRACT>
a foam plastics sheet material, such as for a wallcovering,  comprising a substrate web (10), a sacrificed foam coating  (11) and a foamed coating (12) having macroscopic (0. 5 to 2  mm) voids (13) below the foamed costing (12).  the voids (13)  create a blister effect (15) with many deep and steep valleys  (14).  two processes are described.  in one process  the sacrificed foam coating (11) is foamed first, the foamed  coating (12) in its unfoamed state is then applied and the  material so formed is heated to sacrifice the coating (11) and  foam the coating (12).  in another process both  coatings are applied together in their unfoamed state but the  coating (11) is selected to foam at a lower temperature than  the coating (12).  when heated, the coating (11) is foamed and  then sacrificed whilst the coating (12) foams and blisters.

<DESCRIPTION>
fomi plastics sheet i:terial this invention relates to foam plastics sheet materials having a decorative relief finish, such as wallcovering materials. in order to give a decorative relief finish to foamed plastics sheet materials it is knozm to use mechanical embossing or selective foaming using foam inhibitors or accelerators. the former tends to require expensive and massive machinery. the latter tends to create a glossy, rounded appearance with a depth of relief which is only a small fraction of the foam thickness. the present invention provides a foam plastics sheet material having a pronounced decorative relief finish of good durability, having a soft pleasant touch and suitable for presentation in diverse forms, patterns and colours and comprises a substrate web with a foam coating, some at least of which is blistered so that irregular macroscopic voids exist below the coating arid a wholly or partially sacrificed foam coating exists between the surface coating and the substrate web. the process according to the present invention comprises applying a first foamable composition coating to a substrate web and then applying a second foamable composition coating to the first covering and foaming the second coating whilst sacrificing the first coating whereby irregular macroscopic voids are created below the surface of the second coating. the said process may be carried out in two main ways. in the first way : the first coating, which may be of the same composition as that of the second coating, is foamed prior to applying the second coating so that, in the act of foaming the second coating, the first coating is taken beyond the fully foamed condition and is sacrificed to create said macroscopic voids. in the second way : the first coating is selected to have a lower foaming temperature than that of the second coating and the two coatings are foamed at the same time with the first coating sacrificing at least some of its gas content to create said macroscopic voids. c%tbiled description of tie tstveijtion the invention will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings in which figs. ia, 13, 1c and 1d show sections taken in the steps of manufacturing a material corresponding to the "first way" mentioned above. figs. 2a, 2b and 2e show sections taken in the 'steps of manufacturing a material corresponding to the "second way" mentioned above. in fig. lh there oa shown a paper substrate web 10 with a first or sacrificial coating 11 of first foamable composition. in fig.13 the coating 11 has been fully foamed. in fig.lc a second foamable composition coating 12 is shown on the coating 11. in fig.ld the coating 12 has been heated to cause foaming and at the same time the coating 11 has been taken beyond the fully foamed condition so that the foam structure has been sacrificed. this causes macroscopic voids 13 to appear below the coating 12. the voids 13 create a blister effect 15 with deep valleys 14 on coating 12. many of

claims   1. a foam plastics sheet material having a decorative  relief finish, such as a wallcovering comprising a  substrate web with a foam coating characterised in  that some at least of said coating is blistered with  irregular macroscopic voids between the covering and  substrate and a wholly or partly sacrificed foam  coating exists between the surface coating and  substrate web.   2. a method of making a foam plastics sheet material as  claimed in claim 1 comprising the steps of:  a) applying a first foamable composition coating to  the substrate web;  b) applying        second foamable composition coating to  the first coating; and  c) foaming the second coating whilst sacrificing the  first coating whereby irregular macroscopic voids  are created below the surface of the second coating.   3. the method of claim 2 in which the first coating is  foamed prior to applying the second coating.    4. the method of claim 2 in which the first coating is  selected to have a lower foaming temperature than that  of the second coating and the two coatings are foamed  at the same time.     5. the method of claim 2 in which the substrate web is  given a ground coating of material containing a  polymeric binder.   6. the method of claim 5 in which the ground coating  forms the sacrificial coating.   7. the method of claim 4 in which the first coating     g/m2  contains 0.5 to 10 g/mÃª of blowing agent that decomposes     at a temperature at 7east   1000    below the decomposition  temperature of the blowing agent in the second coating.   8. the method of claim 4 in which the second coating  includes a binder material and contains 1 to   10;    by  weight of blowing agent based on the weight of binder  material.
