<ABSTRACT>
oil-soluble, derivatized ethylene copolymers used as  additives for lubricants, derived from about 2 to 98 weight %  ethylene, and one or more c₃ to c₂₈ alpha-olefins, e. g.  propylene,  which are grafted in the presence of a high-temperature  decomposable free-radical initiator, with an ethylenically-unsaturated  dicarboxylic acid material and thereafter reacted  with a polyamine having at least two primary amine groups,  e. g.  an alkylene polyamine such as diethylene triamine, to  form carboxyl-grafted polymeric imide derivatives are subsequently  reacted with an anhydride of a c₁-c₃₀ hydrocarbyl-substituted  acid, preferably acetic anhydride, to yield an oil-soluble  stable amide of said polyamine.  the oil solutions of  said amide derivative are characterized by minimal viscosity  change over an extended period of time.
