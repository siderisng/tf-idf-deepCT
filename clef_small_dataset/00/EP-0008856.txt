<ABSTRACT>
the device (100) for dissolving the gas in the liquid  includes gas injection means (14) for introducing gas into the  liquid and a contact chamber (20) for containing a downflow­ ing stream of the liquid to be treated.  the pressure within the  downflowing stream increases as it descends and at the ele­ vated pressure the capacity of the liquid to take gas into  solution is greatly increased.  this apparatus (100) for dissolv­ ing gas may conveniently be located below ground level.  a  conduit return means (22) is provided for routing undissol­ ved gas from a region (29) at high pressure to an upstream  portion (16) of the liquid stream so that the gas can be rein­ troduced for dissolution.
