<ABSTRACT>
an optical modulator suitable for use with a collimated  light beam having a moderate cross section and a fast response  time and operational at relatively low voltage includes  a glass prism 12 and a smooth metal surface 14 that  are separated by an adjustable gap 18.  the gap is filled with  air, having an index of refraction lower than the prism.  a  beam 22 of monochromatic light is passed into the prism  at a specific angle of incidence âŠ˜ to undergo total internal  reflection at the glass prismgap interface.  a change of approximately  1 micron in the thickness of the gap is sufficient  to change the reflectivity from greater than 95% to  essentially zero.  the size of the gap is mechanically adjusted  and this mechanical device 20 determines the frequency  response of the light modulation.
