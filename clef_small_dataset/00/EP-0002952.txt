<ABSTRACT>
carburetor components and carburetor providing  a uniform mixture of fuel and air by a high degree of  atomization of the fuel.  the carburetor comprises an upstream  air valve (11) and a downstream throttle valve (30)  which is positively controlled to regulate the engine.   engine suction acts on the air valve to control the relative  air and fuel flows.  fuel discharge orifices (22) are  provided in the surface of the air valve (11) and movement  of the air valve (11) is such that the orifices (22) are always  located in a region of the intake path where the airflow  is highest.  this provides for good atomization of the  fuel and hence the generation of a uniform air fuel mixture  for delivery to the combustion chamber or chambers.  the air valve preferably takes the form of a flap pivotable  about an axis such that a remote edge (21) thereof  moves towards and away from a wall of the carburetor  body (1).  the fuel discharge orifices (22) are normally  formed in the edge (21) and a manifold (23) distributes  fuel thereto from ducts (24) also formed in the valve (11)  communicating with a bore (26) in a shaft (25) defining  the pivotal axis of the valve (11).  the flap may be formed  in two parts secured to one another to define the various  fuel passageways.
