<ABSTRACT>
a continuously variable ratio transmission (1) of the  rolling friction type has a hydraulic control circuit.  the  circuit includes an electromagnetically actuated control  valve (23) and is arranged such that the force exerted on  the control valve is always proportional to the roller (5)  reaction torque, even when the ratio is changing.  the  transmission ratios obtainable are limited by hydraulic  end stops (18) located downstream of an end loading de­ vice (25) for the transmission so that roller torque and  end load are related under the majority of circumstances.   an ultra high pressure blow-off valve (39) is incorpora­ ted however, to avoid transient extremes of pressure  causend by the end stops damaging the input or output  discs (3, 4).  means (57) are also provided enabling elec­ trical operation of the control valve (23) to be overridden  in an emergency.

<DESCRIPTION>
continuously variable ratio transmissions this invention relates to continuously variable ratio transmissions and more particularly to control systems for transmissions of the "rolling friction" type wherein rotatable elements engage one another in a rolling relationship capable of variation to vary the ratio between an input member and an output member of the transmission. in an example of such a transmission tiltable rollers provide a driving connection between facing surfaces of an input disc and an output disc mounted for rotation about a common main axis. to change the transmission ratio the rollers are steered to a different tilt angle by displacing the roller axes out of their equilibrium positions, wherein they intersect the main rolling axis of the discswuntil the desired ratio is obtained, when the rollers are returned to their equilibrium condition. each of the rollers exhibits a driving torque reaction and the roller steering means, which may be hydraulic or mechanical, must balance the total roller torque reaction. the transmission ratio is then changed under steady load conditions by varying the balancing force to above or below that needed to match roller torque reaction. this can be achieved by employing a hydraulic control circuit having, for example, a double sided piston or an interconnected pair of pistons. force on, say, the double sided piston is then determined by the pressure difference between the fluid on its two sides, and thus the transmission ratio can be controlled by varying the value of this pressure difference. according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a continuously variable ratio transmission of the rolling friction type, having a hydraulic control circuit comprising a source of pressurised fluid, and valve means for conirolling fluid flow to a pair of outlets each connected to a sink by way of a respective flow restriction means, characterised in that the difference in pressure in said outlets intermediate said valve means and said. flow restriction means is used to balance roller torque reaction and said pressure difference is proportional to the actuating force on said valve means at least under steady state conditions. preferably the flow restriction means comprise means for ensuring equal flow rates through each of said restrictions to said sink. thus the means may, for example, have variable flow cross sectional area orifices in order to vary their flow resistance to control the flow rate of fluid. such an arrangement enables the pressure difference in the outlets to be proportional to the actuating force at all times, even when additional fluid flow is generated in the outlets by movement of the piston resulting from movement of the rollers in response to changed transmission speeds. preferably means are provided to ensure that pressure immediately downstream of said flow restriction means is kept at or above a datum pressure, whereby hydraulic fluid is maintained in each of said outlets irrespective of whether they are in communication with said source by way of said valve means. moreover it is preferred to include flow control
