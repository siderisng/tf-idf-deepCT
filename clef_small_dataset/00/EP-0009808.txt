<ABSTRACT>
a combination of cyclobenzaprine and diflunisal is useÂ­ ful for inducing skeletal muscle relaxation.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
composition having skeletal muscle relaxant activity this invention relates to compositions for treating muscle spasm of local origin. more particularly, the invention is concerned with a beneficial integration of cyclobenzaprine and diflunisal, 5-(2,4-difluorophenyl)salicylic acid, in the management of skeletal muscle spasm. muscle spasm and related disorders affecting the skeletal muscles affect a large segment of the population and are associated with such conditions as herniated intervertebral discs, muscular and ligamentous sprains and strains, whiplash injury, fractures, dislocations, arthritis, cramps, sciatica, low-back disorders, and the like. at present a variety of medicinals are used in an attempt to alleviate the muscle spasm and the pain associated therewith but use of these various materials unfortunately is limited by concomitant side effects and toxicity which restricts the practical dosage of the materials. accordingly, there is a continuing search for a medication which will have sufficient potency in tolerated doses to interrupt this pain-spasm cycle in a majority of cases when administered either by the oral or parenteral route. further, since the two compowndc selected both have a long duration of action, a bedtime dose will maintain this combined effect on pain and spasm throughout a night's sleep of normal duration. cyclobenzaprine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, has been found to be useful as a skeletal muscle relaxant and is the subject of u.s. patent 3,882,246, directed to this discovery. cyclobenzaprine is highly effective in the treatment of muscular spasm and other similar muscular disorders associated with or caused by injury or arising spontaneously with no known cause. biflunisal is a powerful non-addicting analgesic agent with antiinflammatory properties. this invention relates to a beneficial integration of cyclobenzaprine and diflunisal in the management of acute and chronic musculoskeletal disorders in which inflammation, pain, spasm and spasticity are components of the symptom complex. these syndromes include bursitis, synovitis, tenosynovitis, fibrositis (myositis, fibromyositis, lumbago), strains and sprains, muscle trauma, torticollis, whiplash injury and exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis. the components of the composition are mutually complementary in their relationship and pharmacologic action, and each has a long duration of action. of particular importance is that, in accordance with the invention, clinical dosages of both components may be employed in a twice a day regimen rather than three to four vlracs a %a in the managemen < - o skeletal muscle hyperactivity manifest by pain, spasm, spasticity and inflammation. in a symptom complex involving pain and spasm either component of the complex can trigger the other thus: pair emi3.1 spasm. elimination of one component is beneficial, but elimination of both components is optimal. even with a highly effective drug like cyclobenzaprine the practical dosage of the drug is limited by side effects such as dryness of the mouth and drowsiness, so that with patients with moderate to severe symptoms of disease the relief of symptoms is incomplete in most patients. similarly, with diflunisal the benefit obtained with tolerable doses is incomplete. through the use of both drugs there will be sufficient interaction to have an effect on duration
