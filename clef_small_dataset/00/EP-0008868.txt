<ABSTRACT>
a coated abrasive product has abrasive grits secured to a  flexible backing by maker and size coats, each abrasive grit  consisting essentially of an agglomerate (10) of fine abrasive  grains (12) having an average diameter less ihan about 200  microns and an inorganic, brittle, matrix (14).  the weight  percent of the matrix (14) in each agglomerate (10) is over 35%  of the total weight of the agglomerate (10), and the agglomer足 ates (10) are sufficiently fragile so that they can be broken  down by rubbing between the thumb and forefinger.  the  agglomerates (10) are essentially free of microporosity, so  that the matrix (14) has a relatively high thermal capacity and  a relatively high thermal conductivity.  the agglomerates (10)  have an irregular surface permitting a bond to the maker and  size coats which is stronger than the crush strength of the  agglomerates (10) to permit gradual wearing down of the  agglomerates (10) during grinding by gradual removal of dul足 led abrasive grains (12) from the agglomerates (10).  a process of preparing agglomerates (10) consists in mix足 ing a fusible inorganic salt and finely divided abrasive grains  (12), fusing said inorganic salt, freezing said salt and crushing  the resultant mixture to agglomerates (10).  another process  of preparing agglomerates (10) consists in mixing a solution  of a "polymeric" inorganic salt with finely divided abrasive  grains (12), casting said inorganic salt and abrasive mixture in  a thin layer, heating the layer to drive off water, hardening the  layer and crushing the resultant hardened layer to agglomer足 ates (10).
