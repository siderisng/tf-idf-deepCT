<ABSTRACT>
a method is described for obtaining a tenacious in si­ tu coating deposition of calcite on the inner surface of wa­ ter pipes.  the calcite coating method according to the pre­ sent invention has an advantage that it is able to maintain  a completely corrosion-free system during the coating, thus  assisting the formation of a protective coating of good  bonding bonding properties.  the method consists in the incorporation of a reagent  selected from the group consisting of alkali metal sulfite  and hydrazine, in an amount which is at least the stochio­ metrically required to deoxygenate the aqueous solution  utilized for said coating, which is supersaturated with re­ spect to calcium carbonate having a dissolved calcium and  carbonate levels of above 100 ppm.  the calcite producing  ingredients are supplied to the water stream in quantities  supplementing concentrations available in the natural water  used, giving the required supersaturation levels by addition  of suitable salts.  the calcite coating can be successfully applied to lar­ ge diameter mains and pipes by utilizing a large recycle  ratio.  the coating has in particular an improved adherence  on the wall of the pipes, when the water is delivered at a  flow velocity of above 1. 5 m/sec.
