<ABSTRACT>
The flexible sunroof com takes a fixed rear cap 12, a front cap 13 sliding back and reversally, according to a supplementment, in the opening of the cule vehicle flag, a flexible hood 10 attached to these two cap, a device comprising a housing 14, on which the cap 13 is mounted and through which it is led, and a mechanism, which causes a movement of lowering and veneer of the cap before the cap. Anterior edge of the opening of the pavilion when closing the roof and reversed a take-off and lifting movement of this cap when opening the roof. The mechanism is put into action, when closing the roof, at the moment when the straps 28, attached to the tes, 12 and 13 are stretched, which occurs before the housing reaches it the end of its race. From that moment a rod system, which includes said mechanism, connected to the housing 14 and the cap 13, lowers the latter and the plate against the anterior edge of the flag. The main advantage of this roof lies in the fact that the translation movement of the housing 14 and the veneer movement of the cap 13 are obtained from a single movement (motor shaft 17 of a motor-gearbox 18 mounted directly into Carter 14 in case of motorized control).
