<ABSTRACT>
Hydraulic operating device with a digital input that comprising a movable output member recalled to a neutral position and capable of moving towards one or the other of two work positions under the action of antagonistic hydraulic means, themselves controlled by binary type control members; To create two additional work positions of the movable output member (10), the invention provides that each of the actuating means consists of two active surfaces (S₁, S₁, S₂, ie) actually acting. on the output member (10), and that the pressurization of the first surface is caused by one of the control members (EV₁, EV₂) while that of the other surface is by the other control member provided that the output member has already completed a first step of displacement in the desired direction; Application in particular to the control of double-acting hydraulic and two-speed controls in each direction.
