<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for administering intravenously a drug supplied  initially in powdery form, in particular cytotoxic drugs,  said apparatus comprising a sealed container (22) for the  drug, an infusion set (2 to 20) supplying a drip feed of  intravenous liquid to the patient and also being in communication  with the interior of said sealed container (22), and a  piston-cylinder pump assembly (26, 28, 30) also in communication  with the interior of said container (22) in such a  manner that appropriate actuation of the pump assembly  can first of all draw intravenous liquid from the infusion set  (2 to 20) into the container (22) to dissolve the drug into  solution (64) and thereafter can feed a controlled volume of  said solution (64) from the container (22) to the patient.  the  apparatus thereby provides a closed circuit for the drug  which can be administered without removing from the circuit  any component containing or transporting the drug.  the  apparatus can be made opaque thereby avoiding photodegradation  of photosensitive drugs.
