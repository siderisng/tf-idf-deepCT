<ABSTRACT>
In the sausage production, artificial casing is gathered to caterpillars and raised to the filling tube of the filling machine.The artificial material is then filled in sections with the sausage mass, divided and then sealed with the sealing machine.Before raising the artificial darm on the filling tube, it is pretreated by water to make it suitable for subsequent filling and closing and flushing out chemical additives to the artificial material.In order to be able to carry out a hygienically perfect and time-saving before treatment, a carrier (10) equipped with a gathered artificial medium shell (11) is immersed in an aqueous medium and passed after a residence time to the filling tube (40).Several carriers (10) are mounted with their one end to a holder (8) circumferential in the irrigation means (2).This bracket (8) may be star-shaped and rotatable about a horizontally arranged shaft (6).
