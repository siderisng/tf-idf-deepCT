<ABSTRACT>
the froth flotation of coal in the presence of a con­ densate of an alkanolamine with at least about 0. 8 equiva­ lent of a fatty acid improves the separation of carbonaceous  solids possessing relatively high heat value from ash and  other inert mineral matter.  flotation in the presence of this  condensate is particularly effective to enhance the recovery  of oxidized bituminous coal.

<DESCRIPTION>
alisanolamite-tall oil fatty acid condv ate conditioner for flotation of coal this invention relates to the froth flotation of coal-containing ashes, coal sludge or coal-containing residues to recover coal containing a lower percentage of impurities. in particular, this invention relates to the use of a condensation pr.oduct of an alkanolamine and a fatty acid as a conditioner for the flotation of finely -divided coal. the natural process of "coalification" inherently deposits some non-combustible mineral matter in association with the combustible carbonaceous solids. large fragments of non-combustible material can be removed by screening or other gravity concentration techniques, but other cleaning methods more efficiently remove fine material intimately associated with the carbonaceous solids. froth flotation of coal is used in the art to beneficiate finely-divided raw coal. bituminous coals generally possess a natural hydrophobicity, which results in the coal being floatable in the presence of a frother, such as methyl isobutyl carbinol, desirably with a relatively mild collector, such as kerosene. however, anthracite coals, as well as coals of all grades in which the surface has been at least partially oxidized, float poorly in such a medium, resulting in the loss of significant amounts of combustible material in the tail from the flotation. the loading of the oil-type collector is generally 0.05 to 1 kilogram ser 1000 kg of coal feed for bituminous coals of intermediate or low rank, with the loading being relatively greater for the flotation of lignite and anthracite coals. however, good recovery of oxidized coals or lignite coals can only be effected at such high loadings of the oil-type collector that significant amounts of inert material are floated along with the combustible materials. sun suggests in trans. aime, 199:396 -401 (1954), that fatty amines can be utilized as co-collectors in the flotation of oxidized coals to effect enhanced recovery. however, even these amine collectors float substantial amounts of ash along with the coal and effect only partial recovery of combustible material. the present invention is a froth flotation process for beneficiating coal characterized by: (a) classifying the coal to separate particles of flotation size; and (b) floating the sized coal in a frothing aqueous medium comprising a fuel oil collector and an effec tive amount of a condensation product, or an acid derivative of the condensation product, of an alka nolamine corresponding to the formula i emi3.1 wherein r1 is a ss-hydroxyalkyl group or inertly-substituted ss-hvdroxyalkyl group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms; and r2 and r3 are independently r1, hydrogen, an alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a monovalent group corresponding to the formula emi3.2 wherein y is 2 or 3 and r4 and r5 are independently r1, hydrogen or an alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; condensed with a fatty acid or fatty acid ester in a molar ratio of at least 0.8 mole fatty acid or fatty acid ester per mole of the alkanolamine. the present invention also includes a composition of matter comprising the reaction product of:
