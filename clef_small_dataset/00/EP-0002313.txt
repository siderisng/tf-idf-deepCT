<ABSTRACT>
a process for the catalytic alkylation of isobutane with an  olefin to produce alkylate, in which the liquid reactor effluent  stream (105) comprising a hydrocarbon mixture of alkylate,  isobutane and inert alkanes is partially vapourised by  providing cooling to various condensers (115), (128), (150) in  the alkylation process.  the vapours are then recovered,  compressed and used to provide heat for various distillation  columns (140) used in the process.  as a result of using the process according to the  invention, the total energy input to the process is greatly  reduced.
