<ABSTRACT>
a wire support member for attachment of a wire to a  fixed support structure such as a wooden fence post (1)  consists of a metal plate (4) from which integral spikes are  punched for attachment of the plate to the support structure,  the plate having a projecting lug (8) formed with a hole (9)  through which a wire (2) to be supported passes.  the insertion of the wire (2) into the hole (9) and its  subsequent removal from the hole (9) for replacement is  effected by virtue of a slot (10) in the lug communicating with  the hole (9): this slot (10) can be opened up by twisting the  lug (8), and re-closed after insertion of the wire (2) to trap the  wire in the hole (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
wire support member this invention relates to wire support members. the invention has particular, but not exclusive, reference to wire support members used for supporting wires from fence posts, for example in vineyard cultivation or for other agricultural uses. a common means of attaching wire to wooden support posts is to use wire staples which are driven into each post to clamp the wire to the post. this method of attachment of wires to fence posts proves inconvenient when it is necessary to replace the wire, as frequently occurs in vineyard cultivation. in order to remove a wire it is necessary to prise each staple out of the fence post before placing a fresh wire in position and hammering in a fresh staple. not only is this a timeconsuming operation, but the process of removing each staple and hammering in a fresh staple inevitably loosens the post anchorage in the ground. a known type of device for joining timber frame members comprises'a sheet metal plate having spikes projecting from one side, to be driven into the wooden members to be joined. an object of the present invention is to provide a novel adaptation of this type of device in the form of a wire support member of simple construction which can be used for the attachment of wires to support structures such as posts, as an alternative to the previously used staples. according to the invention there is provided a wire support member comprising a plate provided with spikes upstanding from one side of the plate and adapted to be driven into a support structure, characterised in that the plate is further formed with a lug which in use of the member projects beyond the support structure, the plate further having a hole passing through the lug and a fissure or slot extending from the hole to the periphery of the lug so that a wire can be located in the hole by bending the lug so as to open up the fissure or slot. the plate can be affixed to a support structure such as a wooden post by hammering the spikes into the structure. since the wire can be located in the hole after attachment of the plate to the support structure it is possible to affix the plate before offering up the wire. for example, when a number of wires are to be attached to a wooden support post, the wire support members can be hammered into the post before the post is erected and anchored. once the wire support members are in position it is not necessary to remove them in order to release a wire, for example in order to replace it, since the wire can be released by simply bending the lug so as to open up the fissure or slot sufficiently to allow removal of the wire from the hole. after insertion of a wire in the hole in the lug the lug is simply bent back so that it is essentially coplanar

 claims   1. a wire support member comprising a plate (3) provided with spikes (5) upstanding from one side of the plate and adapted to be driven into a support structure (1), characterised in that, the plate (3) is further formed with a lug   18)    which in use of the member projects beyond the support structure (1), the plate further having a hole (9) passing through the lug (8) and a fissure or slot (10) extending from the hole to the periphery of the lug so that a wire (2) can be located in the hole (9) by bending the lug so as to open up the fissure or slot (10).   2. a wire support member as claimed in claim   1    in which the hole   (9)    is   circular    and passes through the centre of the lug (8).   3. a wire support member as claimed in claim   i    or claim 2, in which the fissure or slot (10) tapers in width from the periphery of the lug (8) to the periphery of the hole (9).    4. a wire support member as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, in which the plate (3) is elongate and is formed with a said lug (8) atone or both ends, a respective said fissure or slot (10) extending from the or each hole (9) to a lateral edge of the lug (8) which is uppermost in use of the member.     5. a wire support member as claimed in claim 4, in which the spikes (5) are arranged in at least one row extending transversely across the plate (3).   6. a wire support member as claimed in claim 5, in which the spikes (5) in the or each row are staggered relatively to each other.   7. a wire support member as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in which the plate (3).is fabricated in sheet metal, the spikes (5), the or each lug (8), the hole (9) and the fissure or slot (10) in the or each lug, being formed by one or more punching operations.
