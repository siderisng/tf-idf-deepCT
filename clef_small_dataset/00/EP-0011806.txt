<ABSTRACT>
novel aqueous liquid emulsion polymers are prepared  by the copolymerization of (a) 15-60 weight percent of a  c₃-c₈ α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid mono­ mer, preferably acrylic or methacrylic acid or a mixture  thereof with itaconic or fumaric acid, (b) 15-80 weight per­ cent of a nonionic copolymerizable c₂-c₁₂ α,β-ethylenically  unsaturated monomer, preferably a monovinyl ester such as  ethyl acrylate or a mixture thereof with styrene, acrylonitrile,  vinyl chloride or vinyl acetate, and (c) 1-30 weight percent of  certain nonionic vinyl surfactant esters, such as nonyl­ phenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy)₉ ethyl acrylate, to give an emul­ sion copolymer stable as an aqueous colloidal dispersion at  an acid ph lower than about 5. 0 but responsive to ph  adjustment with base.  these emulsion polymers adjusted to  a ph of 5. 5-10. 5 or higher are effective thickeners for a wide  variety of aqueous systems including cosmetic products,  drilling muds, and particularly aqueous coating composi­ tions such as latex paint.

<DESCRIPTION>
liquid emulsion polymers useful as ph responsive thickeners for aqueous systems polymeric water-soluble thickening agents are widely known and used in many aqueous systems including latex paints and other aqueous coating compositions-. the widespread use of latex paints, i.e., paints based on aqueous dispersions of synthetic organic polymers, has prompted continued research on product and process improvements. one particularly important concern is controlling the paint rheology to obtain proper flow and leveling with a minimum of dripping and spattering. cellulose ethers, such as described in glomski et al. u.s. 3,769,247, are often effectively used as thickeners for latex paints. however, solid, water-soluble polymers derived from cellulose and other natural products are becoming increasingly expensive to produce because of high capital, energy, and waste control costs. alkali soluble latex copolymers have been known for some time. thus, hager and martin u.s. 3,003,987 and 3,070,561 and miller u.s. 3,081,198 describe copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acids and esters which may be thickened by replacing a portion of the hydrogen ions of the copolymer carboxyl groups with ammonium or alkali metal ions. other types of polymeric thickeners are disclosed by junas and latorre u.s. 3,652,497 and 3,708,445, zimmerman u.s. 3,657,175, chang and mcdowell u.s. 3,891,591, and gibson u.s. 4,003,870. all contain various carboxylic acid groups which can be solubilized in water by neutralization with a water-soluble base. however, to date this technology has had limited impact on major markets for water-soluble polymeric thickeners. more recently, evani and corson developed, as described in u.s. 4,008,202 and related patents, a solid styrene-maleic anhydride-vinylbenzyl ether terpolymer soluble at high ph and useful as a thickener for aqueous solutions. in spite of excellent rheology, stability problems and cost have limited its use as a paint thickener. further improvements in this technology are clearly desirable. this invention relates to new aqueous emulsion polymers which provide stable liquid emulsions having low viscosity and relatively high solids content under acidic conditions, but which become very efficient polymeric thickeners for many aqueous systems when treated with base. these new products are preferably prepared in the form of an aqueous colloidal dispersion of water-insoluble polymer by emulsion polymerization at a ph of about 2.5 to 5.0 of three essential ethylenically unsaturated monomeric components: (a) a carboxylic acid monomer, (b) a nonionic vinyl monomer and (c) a nonionic vinyl surfactant ester. more specifically, a polymer useful as a ph responsive thickener for aqueous systems has been developed comprising an aqueous emulsion copolymer of: a. 15-60 weight percent based on total monomes of at least one c3-c8 a,ss-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer of the formula: emi3.1 where r is h and r' is h, c1-c4 alkyl, or -ch2coox; r is -coox and r' is h or -ch2coox; or r is ch3 and r' is h; and x is h or c1-c4 alkyl; b. 15-80 weight percent of at least one nonionic, copolymerizable c2 -c12 a,ss-ethylenical1y unsaturated monomer of the formula: ch2 = cyz (11) where y is h and z is -coor, -c6h4r', cn,
