<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for conveying metal articles between work  stations comprises spaced apart skids which have conveying  surfaces (9) composed of rows of rotatable elements (13).   the elements (13) have their rotational axes (15) inclined at a  small angle which is in the range 2 - 10 degrees away from  the normal to the conveying surface (9) and have work  surfaces (17b) which are rotatable so that portions thereof  move into and out of the conveying surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
"conveying apparatus" this invention relates to apparatus having a conveying surface for supporting and conveying articles between work stations. according to the present invention there is provided apparatus having a conveying surface for supporting and conveying articles between work stations, comprising a plurality of elements each rotatably mounted about an axis inclined at a small angle to the normal to the conveying surface and having a surface portion which is radially spaced from said axis and which forms part of said conveying surface. preferably, each element includes a disc portion and a-stem portion, the stem portion defining said axis about which the element is rotatably mounted and the disc portion having an annular peripheral surface inclined at said small angle to a plane perpendicular to said axis. conveniently, the diameter of said disc portion is greater than the diameter of said stem portion. conveniently, thrust bearing means rotatably support said stem portion on a support member. part of the thrust bearing means may be integral with the stem portion. the thrust bearing means may include a bearing surface forming part of a sphere. the thrust bearing means may include a spherical bearing member interposed between the end of the stem portion of each element and the support member. al'-ezatively, the thrust bearing means may include a part-splwical end face on the stem portion. other forms nf thrust bearing means may be used around the circumfer of of the stem portion. the stem portion of the elements may each incorporate a circumferentially-extending annular recess adapted to accommodate a locating spigot releasably secured to the support member, to secure the elements to the support member while permitting rotational movement of the elements wich respect to the support member. the spigots may be in the form of grub screws with domed ends for engaging in the recesses. the support member may be orientated to provide a horizontal conveying surface or an inclined conveying surface and the rotatably mounted elements may be arranged rows or otherwise disposed over the conveying surface. embodiments of the present invention will now be eribed by way of example with reference to the accompany -ng drawings, in whibh, fig. 1 is an end view of part of a first embodiment -cording to the present invention; fig. 2 is a plan view of a component of fig. 1; fig. 3 illustrates a further component of fig. 1 in greater detail; fig. 4 is a cross section taken in the line 4-4 of ig. 2; fig. 5 is a diagrammatic plan view of the embodiment and illustrating the formation of the conveying surface; figs. 6 and 7 are plan and elevational views of a second embodiment; and figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11 illustrate modification of cetails of the embodiments. the embodiments are primarily intended for conveying metal articles between work stations and in particular form skids which are useful in the handling of steel workpieces such as h, i, t or u sections where there is usually an attendant high
