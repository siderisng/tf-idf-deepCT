<ABSTRACT>
a button (1), the underside of which exhibits a collar-like extension (2) having a perforation transversely to the longitudinal axis of the extension (2), is fastened by means of a rivet having at least one rivet prong to a carrier material (5) in such a way that the rivet having at least one prong passes through the perforation in the collar-like extension (2) of the button (1) and is bent round in the direction of the rivet backplate.  the button, of any desired material, fastened in this way is provided with all-round mobility like a sewn-on button.  during the fastening process, it remains free from the applied rivet pressure and can therefore be designed without regard to pressure stability.  <image>
