<ABSTRACT>
1.  a device for automatically monitoring the charge state of a mains-independent current supply of the stationary responder of an arrangement which serves to determine the location of traffic equipment which is in radio contact with an interrogation device, which is installed in the traffic equipment, and reciprocally exchanges data telegrams, where the current supply unit consisting of primary batteries or charged accumulators are connected via solar cells to a monitoring circuit (ts1, z, r1, r2, r3) having a response threshold for transmitting an alarm signal, which threshold lies above the minimum voltage required for the undisturbed operation by a determinately adjustable value, and where the result of the measurement of the voltage (ub ) carried out in each interrogation process of the interrogation device, is fed to a telegram register (tr) as a monitoring signal, added to the telegram which contains the path data and transmitted from the reply device to the interrogation device in coded form characterized in that in order to additionally monitor the atmospheric humidity of the interior of the responder, there is provided a sensor (r7) arranged close to the micro-wave circuit to be monitored, and which responds when a given limit value of the atmospheric humidity is exceeded, and whose control signal is converted via a transistor circuit (ts2) into a binary signal which is inserted into the reply telegram by means of an or-gate (g) linked to the monitoring signal for the supply voltage.
