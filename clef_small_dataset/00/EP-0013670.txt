<ABSTRACT>
an actuating mechanism for a screen (1) which, for fire protection purposes, is mounted displaceably to and fro in a linear guide or pivotally about an axis for the closing of a passage orifice, possesses an electromagnetic coupling device (8) which, in its excited state, keeps a driving wheel (4) connected to a drive motor (2) in operative connection with the screen (1), and after the cancellation of the working connection for closing the passage orifice at the end of the closing movement of the screen (1) the drive connection is made again.  <image>
