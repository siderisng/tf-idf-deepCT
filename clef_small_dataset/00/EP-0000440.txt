<ABSTRACT>
articles having polymethyl methacrylate surface regions  (32) reinforced by thermoplastics (e. g.  polypropylene)  members (34) having a surface (33) conforming to the  shape of the polymethyl methacrylate surface region (32).  preferably a decorative sheet (36) (e. g.  melded cloth)  is sandwiched between the surface region (32) and the conforming  surface (33).  the polymethacrylate surface region may be applied  to a preformed conforming surface of the thermoplastics  member by using the conforming surface as one part of a  mould which defines the shape of the surface; filling the  mould with a syrup of methylmethacrylate monomer and  polymerizing the syrup in contact with the conforming surface.
