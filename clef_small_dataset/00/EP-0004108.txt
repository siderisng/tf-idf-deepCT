<ABSTRACT>
a process for quaternisation of tertiary amines in a reaction  medium comprising a water soluble or water dispersible  organic compound of mwt > 240 which is liquid at the  quaternisation reaction temperature, one of the quaternisation  reactants having a bpt < 200Â°c and being volatile relative  to the other reactants, to permit its removal after the  completion of quaternisation to leave a product comprising  an intimate mixture of a cationic surfactant and the reaction  medium in a weight ratio of 2:1 to 1:50.  preferably the reaction  medium is an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant.
