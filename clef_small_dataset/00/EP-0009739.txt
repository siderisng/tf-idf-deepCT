<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure deals with a machine for transferring  indicia (such as decalcomanias) from an elongated web or  carrier strip to tapered articles, such as tumblers, at a high  rate of speed.  the articles are moved along a transport path  and means are provided to turn the articles as the articles are  moved through an indicia transferring portion of the path.   the web and the articles are moved in the same direction  and in a generally straight line, and the articles are rolled  across the web and the indicium, thereby peeling the indi­ cium from the web.  means are provided to tilt the axes of the  tapered tumblers relative to the plane of the web in order to  place the side of the tumbler, which engages the web, paral­ lel to the web.  hold-down means is provided to force the  tumblers to move in a straight line while rolling.  decals  formed with an initial compensating distortion are used in  the machine, to compensate for the distortion of the decals  that occurs as the decals are transferred to the tumblers.   means is provided to control the registration of the decals  and the tumblers, and means is provided to reduce the ten­ dency of the web to have a different speed that the drive.
