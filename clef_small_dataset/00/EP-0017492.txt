<ABSTRACT>
for combustion of solid fuel a cylindrically shaped burner, having an outer casing (10) and an inner casing (12), is used.  the burner rotates about its principal axis, and is arranged so that solid fuel fed in is moved along its length as it rotates.  air is introduced into the burner through parts (20) in the inner casing (12) at least where the fuel congregates during rotation, so that the air passes through the fuel inside the burner.

<DESCRIPTION>
"combustion of solid fuel". background to the invention this invention relates to the combustion of solid fuel and is concerned with an efficient method of burning such fuel and a burner for burning such fuel efficiently. the solid fuel may be coal, coke, anthracite, wood, peat, or other solid fuel in lump or similar form. at present for burning solid fuel "underfed" burners are used. such burners have a floor grate through which solid fuel is supplied to a burning zone either by a screw feeder or a chain feeder. this type of burner has a number of defects, for example, the grate tends to burn away in use, combustion is generally poor, and the burner must be cleaned frequently which cleaning involves extremely uncomfortable work. it is also known to burn pulverised solid fuel such as coal powder, in a rotary burner. one problem with such burners is that they involve an exacting technique requiring finely controlled conditions. also starting up is difficult and requires liquid or gaseous fuel to bring the burner up to the required temperature for igniting the powder and such fluid fuel is also required to maintain combustion. moreover the installation must be large and small burners cannot be constructed on this principle. also the heat produced is not easily controllable over a wide range. the burner is expensive per se and further expense is also incurred in providing machinery for pulverising the coal to powder and large capacity air compressors are required for producing air for combustion. finaliy it may be mentioned that the exhaust is "dirty" insofar as it contains considerable fine ash so that this type of installation is not suitable for direct air heating and apparatus, such as scrubbers, are required for cleaning the exhaust. this invention seeks to provide a burner for solid fuel which will be efficient, simple and reliable in construction, and easily controllable with regard to the amount of heat produced. it is also preferred that the burner shall be self-cleaning. summary of the invention according to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of burning a solid fuel including the steps of feeding a solid fuel to a cylindrical burner, arranging the burner so that as the burner is rotated the fuel moves along the length of the burner)rotating the burner to cause the fuel to form a mass that tumbles over itself, and feeding combustion air to the fuel through the walls of the burner at desired locations at the base of the mass of fuel. preferably the principal axis of the burner is inclined, so that fuel fed into one end of the burner moves along the length of the burner as the burner rotates, and the residue remaining after the fuel has been burnt is automatically discharged from the other end of the burner. the angle of inclination will be very small, and may be between 0,5 and 5 degrees. thequantityof heat generated by the burner can be controlled by

   claims      a method of burning a solid fuel including the steps of feeding the solid fuel to a cylindrical burner, arranging the burner so that as the burner is rotated, the fuel moves along the length of the burner, rotating the burner to cause the fuel to form a mass that tumbles over itself, and feeding combustion air to the fuel through the walls of the burner at desired locations at the base of the mass of fuel.   2 a method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the fuel entering the burner begins its movement through the burner at a point above the burner outlet, so that gravity induces the movement of the fuel along the length of the burner.   3 a method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein air is additionally fed into the burner at locations which are not at the base of the mass of fuel.     4.   a burner for solid fuel, comprising a cylindrical outer casing, a cylindrical inner casing forming   wan annular    space with the outer casing, generally longitudinally extending elements arranged in the annular space between the inner and outer casings and dividing the annular space into a plurality of longitudinally extending compartments;  a plurality of ports extending through the refractory lining at longitudinally and circumferentially spaced positions thereof to connect each compartment with the interior of the burner, each port being inclined with respect to a radius of the cylindrical burner casings and supports all being inclined in the same sense, means supporting the burner for rotation about an axis, means for rotating the burner in a direction such that the radially innermost end of each port trails the radially outermost end thereof, controllable means for selectively admitting combustion air to each of the compartments at a desired location, and means for feeding solid fuel particles or lumps into the burner, the burner being arranged so that the fuel fed in travels along the length of the burner as the burner is rotated.   5.   a burner as claimed in claim 4, wherein the principal axis of the burner is inclined to the horizontal, with the inlet being higher than the outlet.    6.   a burner as claimed in claim 5, wherein the angle of inclination of the principal axis to the horizontal is between 0,5 and   ro    7.   a burner as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6, including a heat exchanger for transferring heat from air to another heat exchange   medium.           8,    a burner as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 7, wherein the means for selectively admitting combustion air comprises a manifold surrounding one end of the burner and communicating with each of the compartments, the manifold being divided into two sections with one of the sections being fed with air from a blower and the other section being connected with said one section via a controllable valve.
