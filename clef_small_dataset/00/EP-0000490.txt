<ABSTRACT>
compounds of formula    wherein   x is sulfur, oxygen or imino;   n is an integer of from 2 to 6 such that the length of  the carbon chain connecting the two nitrogen  atoms is not less than 2;   r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄ and r₅ are independently hydrogen, loweralkyl,  loweralkoxy, amino, haloloweralkyl, or phenyl;  or any two adjacent substituents may be joined  to form a benzo substituent;   r₆ and r₇ are independently hydrogen, phenyl-loweralkyl,  n-loweralkylcarbamoyl,  n-loweralkylthiocarbamoyl; or r₆ and r₇ may be  joined to form a morpholino ring or r₆ and r₇  may be an alkylene linkage of 4 or 5 carbon  atoms to form a pyrrolidine or piperidine group  which may be substituted with loweralkyl, oxo or  benzo substituents;  and the broken line in the 3,4 position of the naphthyridine  molecule indicates that the bond may be either a single or a  double bond; and the acid addition and quaternary  ammonium salts thereof, provided that when n is 2, r₃, r₅, r₆  and r₇ are all methyl groups x, is oxygen and the 3,4-position  is unsaturated at least one of r₁, r₂ or r₄ is other than hydrogen  are disclosed.  these compounds inhibit gastric secretions in the  gastro-intestinal tract.
