<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a camlock for engaging the  inside of tubular members to suspend apparatus from the  tubular members.  the camlock comprises a movable spacer (154) disposed  on a slidable member (152) between two expandable metal  rings (158, 160).  the relative motion of the spacer and  slidable member causes the metal rings to be expanded  against the inside of the tubular member thereby supporting  the apparatus.  the metal rings have a thin wall with internal  ribs (202) that fit closely to the slidable member.  the internal  ribs act as stops (208) on the inside of the metal rings so as to  prevent their overexpansion.

<DESCRIPTION>
a camlock for remote access ,lanipulator this invention relates to an improved camlock for supporting equipment from a tubular member. there are many situations in which a hazardous environment limits human access to various locations. one such situation occurs in the inspection and renair of nuclear steam generators. a typical nuclear steam generator comprises a vertically oriented shell, a plurality of u-shaped tubes disposed in the shell so as to form a tube bundle, a tube sheet for supporting the tubes at the ends opposite the u-like curvature, and a dividing plate that cooperates with the tube sheet forming a primary fluid inlet plenum at one end of the tube bundle and a primary fluid outlet plenum at the other end of the tube bundle. the primary fluid having been heated by circulation through the nuclear reactor core enters the steam generator through the primary fluid inlet plenum. from the primary fluid inlet plenum, the primary fluid flows upwardly through first openings in the u-tubes near the tube sheet which supports the tubes, through the u-tube curvature, downwardly through second openings in the u-tubes near the tube sheet, and into the primary fluid outlet plenum. at the same time, a secondary fluid, known as feedwater, is circulated around the u-tubes in heat transfer relationship therewith thereby transferring heat from the primary fluid in the tubes to the secondary fluid surrounding the tubes causing a portion of the secondary fluid to be converted to steam. since the primary fluid contains radioactive particles and is isolated from the secondary fluid by the u-tube walls and tube sheet, it is important that the u-tubes and tube sheet be maintained defect-free so that no breaks will occur in the u-tubes or in the welds between the u-tubes and the tube sheet, thus preventing contamination of the secondary fluid by the primary fluid. occasionally, it is necessary to either inspect or repair the u-tubes or tube sheet welds by way of access through the primary fluid inlet and outlet plena. for this purpose manholes are provided in the vertical shell so that working personnel may enter the inlet and outlet plena to perform operations on the u-tubes and tube sheet. however, since the primary fluid which is generally water contains radioactive particles, the inlet and outlet plena become radioactive which thereby limits the time that working personnel may be present therein. accordingly, it would be advantageous to be able to perform operations of the u-tubes and tube sheet without requiring the presence of working personnel. there are several mechanisms known in the art that attempt to provide a solution to this problem, but none of them have been able to completely solve the problem. in united states patent no. 3,913,452 to c. t. ;tard et awl0, issued october 21, 1975 and entitled "remote movable platform", there is described a remotely movable carriage which serves as a mobile platform from which remotely initiated and controlled inspection and work operations might be performed on the tubes in

a central member (128) disposed within said inner housing (126) and having a cup member (130) attached to the top portion thereof so as to form a step (132) that allows said cup member (130) to rest on said inner housing (126); a first slider member (134) disposed within said cup member (130) and capable of relative motion with respect to said cup member (130) and a first biasing means (136) arranged between said first slider member (134) and said cup member (130) for urging said first slider member (134) against said cup member (130);  a second slider member (142) slidably disposed within said cup member (130) and said central member (128) and capable of contacting said first slider member (134), said cup member (130) and said second slider member (142) and said central member (128) defining a first annular chamber (146) therebetween for accommodating a first fluid for forcing said second slider member (142) downwardly with respect to said cup member   (130);    a third slider member (152) disposed with said second slider member (146) capable  of contact mechanism (158, 160) formed near the top end thereof;  a fourth slider member (162) being an integral portion of said third slider member (152) slidably disposed within said second slider member (142) and said central member (128) with said fourth slider member (162), said second slider member (142), and said third slider member (152) defining a second annular chamber (164) for accommodating a second fluid for forcing said third slider member (152) downwardly with respect to said second slider member (142) thereby causing said contact mechanism (158, 160) to contact said tubular member (38) and to support said support plate (122) therefrom; and biasing means (170) arranged between said second slider member (142) and said fourth slider member (162) for urging said fourth slider member (162) against said second slider member (142) thereby tending to close said second annular chamber (164);  said second slider member (142) and said central member (128) defining a third annular chamber (172) between the bottom of said second slider member (142) and central member (128) for accommodating a third fluid for forcing said second slider member (142) upwardly toward said equipment thereby causing said third slider member (152) and said fourth slider member (162) to be moved upwardly.    2. a camlock as defined in claim 1 wherein it further comprises an outer member (176) disposed around said central member (128) with a fifth slider member (178) slidably disposed therebetween and defining a fourth annular chamber (182) therebetween for accommodating a fourth fluid for forcing said fifth slider member (178) upwardly against said  inner housing (126) thereby causing said inner housing (126) to become aligned   with    said third slider member (152) thus causing said slave carriage (52) to become properly positioned with respect to said tubular member   (38);
