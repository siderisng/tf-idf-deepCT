<ABSTRACT>
method for the construction and anchorage of a building  structure or the like, preferably a launched and floating buil­ ding (1) or several building sections, to a foundation.  on the  construction site there is prepared a foundation whose crown  or head portion is located below the draught of the floating  building structure (1).  the structure (1) is supported against  the foundation by means of pillars or legs such that at least the  substantial portion of the loads is transmitted by the pillars to  the foundation.  the foundation is surrounded with a sheet  pile wall with an opening through which the building structure  floated in over the foundation, and the opening is closed  once the structure has been moved in over the foundation.   the building structure is supported against the foundation  and the water inside the pile sheet wall is thereafter evacua­ ted.
