<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns devices for use in magnetic field  sensors, of the kind incorporating a p-n-p-n structure of circular  geometry, within which there may be formed a carrier  domain which will, when an appropriate magnetic field is  applied, rotate around the centre of the structure at a frequency  dependent on the flux density.  to achieve high sensitivity  for field measurement, there is adopted a p-n-p-n  structure whose four regions (2,3,4,5) are all bounded by a  planar surface (1) of the semiconductor, the structure having  one end region (3) centrally disposed and the other (5) forming  an annular intrusion into the adjacent intermediate region  (4), which is also annular and has contact made to it only  outwardly of the annular end region (5).  the structure may be  fabricated by diffusion, and has an associated electrode system  preferably providing plural contacts to at least one of the  intermediate regions (2,4).  various ways of utilising such a  device are disclosed.
