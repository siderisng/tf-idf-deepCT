<ABSTRACT>
a method for processing substrate materials by treating  plasma, including the steps of mounting said substrate materÂ­ ials onto a series of electrode plates (13) arranged in parallel to  each other, alternately connecting said electrode plates to a  pair of bus lines (31, 32) and applying a high-frequency power  (17) between said pair of bus lines for producing plasma  between said electrode plates, said method comprising the  step of changing the feeding points of said high-frequency  power on said pair of bus lines so that said plasma treatment  is effected substantially uniformly in the spaces between said  electrode plates.
