<ABSTRACT>
a split-wheel assembly comprising a central-supporting wheel body arranged to be mounted to conventional vehicle-hub members, wherein the body includes oppositely disposed annular recesses to receive inner and outer rim members therein, the rim members being removably mounted to the wheel body by a plurality of socket-head bolts wherein sealing rings are positioned and interposed between each rim member and each annular recess of the central wheel body, whereby the rims may be provided with a combination of various width dimensions to correspond to the different sizes and types of tires.  due to the use of a given pair of wheel rims for a particular size tire, a selected tire can be centrally positioned within a given tire well of a vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
split-wheel assembly. this invention relates to wheels that support tires on vehi cles and, more particularly, to a split-rim-wheel assembly that allows interchanging of different sizes of wheel rims to accomodate any given size and width of tire. as is well known in the art, various problems and difficulties are encountered in providing suitable split-rim wheels for tires, particularly where a different tire size is often substituted. several types of tire wheel structures are used to accomodate the various tires. however, up to the present time, these wheel structures have had inherent problems, one of these being that wheel structures are designed to accomodate a very limited tire-size range. secondly, when one wants to change a vehicle tire to a larger width, he encounters the problem of being unable to centrally position the tire within the tire well of the vehicle. many times, for instance, a large tire will protrule outwardly from the outer edge of a fender well. thus, a specially designed wheel must be provided, and/or be specially arranged with additional elements; or the fender must be physically altered to prevent damage to the extended portion of the oversized tire. it is important to note that -- as the oversized tire protrudes outwardly -- there is created unused space between the inner side of the tire and the inner portion of the fender well. hence, it is most desirable to provide a wheel that will accomodate any size tire, and that will allow the tire to be centrally positioned at all times within the fender well -- at the same time requiring no special tools, additional elements, or alteration of the fender well. accordingly, the presently disclosed wheel assembly provides positive solutions to the known and well established problems found in both passenger automobiles and racing vehicles. the following patents are examples of several known wheel structures: united states patent no. 3,357,747, wherein the wheel construction comprises banx of filaments integrated by a binder and laminated to form a toroidal body which is severed, providing first and second sections that are joined in back-to-back relation. united states patent no. 3,880,219, comprising a wheel rim having two rim portions secured together by fastening members engaging radially, inwardly extending attachment flanges, a channel being formed between the attachment flanges to receive a sealing ring of smaller width, measured in the radial direction of the rim, than that of the channel measured in the radial direction. another wheel construction is disclosed in united states patent no. 2,868,260. this invention provides a positive bead lock for one of the beads of the tire mounted on a rim of the invention. united states patent no. 3,998,258 discloses an expandable tirerim arrangement and a method of installation. united states patent no. ,013,499 provides an apparatus for supporting a tire while a strip of premolded tread is being applied thereto, in order to reconstruct the tread of the tire. the present invention provides a three-piece split-wheel assembly wherein a central-supporting wheel body is arranged having

<CLAIMS>
 claims 1. split-wheel assembly having interchangeably sized wheel rims to accommodate various sizes and widths of tires, wherein the tire is always centrally positioned within a given fender well of a given   vehicle,    said assembly characterized in having;  a central-supporting wheel-body member;  an outer rim member removalby secured to said wheel-body member;  an inner rim member removably secured to said   vheel-body    member opposite said outer rim member, wherein a given width dimension of said tire to be mounted thereon determines the width relationship between said inner and outer rim members;  means for removably securing said rim members to said wheel-body member; and  means for sealing said rim members to said wheel-body member.   2. a split-wheel assembly as recited in claim 1, wherein said centralsupporting wheel-body member includes:  a pair of oppositely disposed annular recesses formed on opposite sides of said body along the outer edges thereof;  said recesses being defined by radial shoulder members; and  a plurality of juxtaposed holes disposed within said recesses to receive said securing means.   3. a split-wheel assembly as recited in claim 2, wherein each of said rim members includes:    a depending, inner, annular flange member arranged to be received in respective recesses and to abut against said radial shoulder of each recess; and  a plurality of juxtaposed holes formed in said flanges to receive said securing means therethrough when aligned with said holes disposed in said recesses.    4. a split-wheel assembly as recited in claim 3,   where    said sealing means comprises:  a pair of annular grooves, each groove thereof being formed in said annular recesses so as to be oppositely disposed to each other; and  a pair of "o"-ring sealing members received in said grooves for sealing engagement with said flanges of said rim members.   5. a split-wheel assembly as recited in claim 4, wherein each of said rim members includes a radial, reverse lip member formed thereon.
