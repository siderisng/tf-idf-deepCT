<ABSTRACT>
the disclosure illustrates a viscous vibration damper (10)  capable of manufacture using low cost fabrication techni­ ques.  formed and welded steel plates (16,18) form an annular  working chamber (36) containing a viscous fluid and an annu­ lar inertia ring (38) consisting of series of stacked welded discs  (40, 42, 44).  one of the discs (40) has a pair of spaced holes (46,  48) at fixed locations relative to its central axis (a).  the remain­ ing discs (44) have dimples (66, 68) at the same location  relative to their central axis.  the dimples (66, 68) permit the  discs to be nested in concentric alignment.  the outermost  discs (42, 44) have holes (76) which provide recesses for nylon  bearing pads (78) for the inertia ring (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
title "viscous vibration damper" the present invention relates to rotary dampers and more specifically to the type of damper known as a viscous vibration damper. vibration dampers of the type shown in u.s. patent 2,824,467 damp torsional vibrations in a rotary output t se as the crankshaft of an internal combustion ezigine. an annular housing is secured to the crankshaft, and has a chamber filled with highly viscous fluid and a heavy ring known as an inertia ring. when the engine is operating and producing torsional vibrations in the crankshaft, the inertia ring tends to oscillate relative to the housing. the relative movement causes a working of the viscous fluid thereby dissipating the vibrational energy in the form of heat. such a damper has proven effective in damping torsional vibrations for high horsepower engines. however, it is expensive since the inertia ring must be made from a casting or forging and the housing from another casting castings and forgings have continued to escalate in cost. since they constitute a major part of the damper, they prevent the manufacture of a low cost damper. in the past, some attempts have been made to fabricate various elements of dampers torsional vibration in other than cast form. examples are u.s. patents no. 2,092,591 and 1,718,208 which show the inertia ring made from a pair of discs. however, this is not a truly effective construction since it fails to insure adequate axial concentricity between the discs. the above problems are solved by a vibration damper of the above type where the inertia ring comprises a plurality or stacked discs with means for securing the elements in concentric alignment. in a preferred embodiment the discs have means for forming a protrusion from one face at least at two fixed locations relative to the central axis thereof and to each other. an indentation on the opposite face at the same fixed locations enables the discs to be nestled in concentric alignment. the above and other related features of the present invention will be apparent from a reading of the following description of the disclosure shown in the accompanying drawings and the novelty thereof pointed out in the appended claims. in the drawings: figure 1 is an end view of a viscous vibration damper embodying the present invention. figure 2 is a sectional view of the vibration damper of figure 1 along with a portion of an internal combustion engine crankshaft to which it may be secured. figure 3 is a highly enlarged fragmentary view of the damper of figure 2. referring to figures 1 and 2, the viscous vibration damper 10 is adapted to be secured to the nose 12 of a crankshaft 14 such as one for an internal combustion engine. to this end the damper 10 comprises first and second discs 16 and 18 each having hoes 20 which receive screws 22 to secure'the damper 1c to he crankshaft 14. a circular protrusion @4 pilots the damper 10 by means of a central opening
