<ABSTRACT>
a tubular member such as a cartridge which is filled with  a material that, upon heating, changes its state from liquid to  solid (such as wax) is flocked to enhance heat transfer from  the tubular member to hair rolled around the tubular  member.  top and bottom snap-on flanged ends of low heat  conducting material are connected to the tubular cartridge  by a base means having a base portion and base sides.  the  sides include a plurality of locking means comprised of radial  protrusions or a locking portion having a camming surface, a  locking lip, and a locking surface, the radial protrusions or  locking portions for communication with a groove in the  tubular cartridge.  venting is provided in each base portion to  promote heat dissipation from the flanged ends.  an aperture  is provided in the bottom flanged end base portion in  registry with an aperture in the tubular cartridge for receiving  a means for heating the roller.  crushing ribs may be  provided on each base side to contact the flocked tubular  cartridge to prevent axial rotation between the flanged ends  and the tubular member.  alternatively, the tubular member  may be a high heat conducting tubular material having  convex protrusions which mate with concave indentations in  the base sides.  spacing projections to space the tubular  member from the base portion of the flanged ends may be  alternatively employed.
