<ABSTRACT>
a body implantable lead comprises a lead portion (10)  having a distal electrode end portion (12) and a proximal  terminal end protion (13).  end portion (12) comprises a helical  tissue securing member (42) adapted to be screwed into ani­ mal tissue by the rotation of stylet (20) via slotted screwdriver  end (62) and slot (64).  the stylet (20) is rotated by a knob (74)  secured to the proximal end of the stylet and in order for the  operator to sense the depth of insertion of the tissue securing  member (42) the knob (74) is formed with at least one lon­ gitudinal slot detentingly engaged by a pawl formed in the  guide (76) to give a sensible indication each time a predeter­ mined rotational increment has been traversed.
