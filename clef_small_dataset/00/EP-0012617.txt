<ABSTRACT>
the water of crystallization of a ceramic material, kaoli­ nite, is used as a standard for calibrating equipment used for  measuring the amount of hydrogen in a nuclear fuel pellet.  a  kaolinite is heated to a temperature sufficient to drive out the  water of crystallization in the kaolinite which is a precisely  known amount and the amount is measured.  comparison of to  the equipment readout with the known values determines the  accuracy of equipment calibration.  a nuclear fuel pellet is  placed in the equipment and exposed to a temperature suff­ cent to drive off moisture therein after the equipment has  been accurately calibrated.  the hydrogen content is then  measured to provide an accurate indication of total hydrogen  content in the pellet.

<DESCRIPTION>
method for calibrating analytical moisture measuring equipment the invention described herein relates to a method of calibrating analytical hydrogen measuring apparatus for measuring small amounts of water. a conventional nuclear reactor fuel rod of the type used in commercial nuclear reactors comprises a long narrow tube of zircaloy having multiple fuel pellets sealed therein. when the fuel rod is irradiated during operation of the reactor, hydrogen and other gases are released as a by-product of the fission process, but these gases are contained in the sealed rod and do not escape to the surrounding uperheated water which ultimately is used to generate steam for power generating purposes. it has been found that excessive hydrogen in the fuel pellets appearing mostly as moisture, causes hydriding of the zircaloy fuel rod when the hydrogen is released from the fuel pellet during operation of the reactor. the resulting corrosive effects of the hydriding may cause a breach in the fuel rod material and result in radioactive particles leaking into the water circulating through the reactor. to overcome this disadvantage, the upper limit set on permissible moisture content in a pellets or more appropriately, the total moisture equivalent of hydrogen in all forms, was set at 10.5 ppm or less for an average of a region of fuel. in the past, the leco corporation, st. joseph michigan, commercial hydrogen determinator, model rh1e, was used for measuring hydrogen alone while a cec (consolidated electrodynamics corporation) moisture determinator was used for measuring moisture in the moisture content of fuel pellets. the leco determinator operating temperature is sufficiently high to dissociate water and is therefore capable of measuring the hydrogen content in moisture. however, there is no known method of accurately determining whether the determinator is always operating accurately. the degree of precision needed in measuring finite amounts of hydrogen, both alone and from the water molecule, dictates that a single, high temperature moisture standard be utilized to measure total hydrogen, including moisture, on a leco hydrogen or other analyzer. it is therefore the principal object of the present invention to provide a standard for the measurement of small amounts of water which can be used to not only qualify the measuring apparatus but also to keep it in a high state of calibration. with this object in view the present invention resides in a method of determining the hydrogen content of nuclear fuel pellets wherein a nuclear fuel pellet whose hydrogen content is to be measured is placed into a hydrogen measuring apparatus in which said pellet is exposed to a temperature sufficient to assure the extraction of moisture from said pellet, and the content of hydrogen in the moisture extracted from said pellet is measured and a readout thereof is provided on said apparatus, characterized in that before the water content of said fuel pellet is measured a compound having a water of cryallization of a known amount is surface-dried and sealed in said apparatus and is then heated to the temperature at which the

what we claim is:    1. a method of determining the hydrogen content of nuclear fuel pellets wherein a nuclear fuel pellet whose hydrogen content is to be measured is placed into a hydrogen measuring apparatus in which said pellet is exposed to a temperature sufficient to assure the extraction of moisture from said pellet, and the content of hydrogen in the moisture extracted from said pellet is measured and a readout thereof is provided on said apparatus, characterized in that before the water content of said fuel pellet is measured a compound having a water of crystallization of a known amount is surface-dried and sealed in said apparatus and is then heated to the temperature at which the water of crystallization is driven from the compound,  the quantity of hydrogen in the moisture driven from the compound is measured and compared with the quantity of hydrogen known to be in the water of crystallization of said compound and the apparatus is then precisely adjusted so as to provide an accurate reading for the following measuring of the water content of the fuel pellet.    2. a method according to claim 1, characterized in that the fuel pellet is exposed to a temperature of about   2000"c    to assure the release of all water from the pellet.     3. a method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a small portion of the compound is enclosed in a capsule having a melting temperature below the temperature at which the water of crystallization is  withdrawn from the compound so as to assure retention of the compound in a dry environment until the capsule is melted during heating thereby to expose the compound to the apparatus heat.    4. a method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that a compound having a water of crystallization less than 19% and a temperature at which the water of crystallization is withdrawn of more than   300"c    is selected as reference compound.    5. a method according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said compound is kaolinite.
