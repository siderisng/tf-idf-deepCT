<ABSTRACT>
To form a device for fixing installation installers which have a quick-mounting device with a fixed and a movable nose arranged on the bottom of the installation device, with which the individual installation device can be consumed on a hat profile rail so that the fixed or movable grab the nose behind the free leg ends of the hat profile rail, a support plate (10, 50, 100) is provided, at which the busbars are supported and the one with a first L-shaped formation (14, 70) is determined, so that some The built-in installation equipment with the fixed nose is released the free leg of the first exhibition and is supported on the other side on the collective rail. In order to snap on the support plate (10, 50, 100) on the support plate (10, 50, 100), a support strip (12, 52) is made on the support plate (10, 50, 100), which is designed to be with the first The form of the shape of the hat profile rail is adapted to which further installation installation devices are snapped. The support strip can be attached by inserting into a groove (20) or by snapping between two grooves (70, 80) under the use of the elastic suspension of the support strip on the support plate. Thus, installation installation devices can be attached to two types on the support plate.
