<ABSTRACT>
disclosed is a system comprising elements distributed in three dimensions which is designed for the utilization of propagating energy and/or energy fields which is/are affected by the shape, the surface characteristics, the size, the composition, and particularly, the distribution of the elements and/or the distribution of the voids between the elements; all of which may function together as a system of modulators, detectors, demodulators, collectors, absorbers, transmitters, oscillators, transformational devices, transducers, or any combination of the above functions.  such a system of elements is described as having an ordered, three-dimensional distribution with respect to an orderly system of points which occur in specific relative positions.  the interaction of propagating energy and/or energy fields with these systems of elements, e. g.  spherical elements stacked in pyramids, may be utilized for the distribution, transmission, detection, and collection of mechanical, electromagnetic, magnetic, gravitational, electrostatic, electromechanical, and/or pressure-vacuum energy.
