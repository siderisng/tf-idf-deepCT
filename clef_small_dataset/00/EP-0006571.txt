<ABSTRACT>
plasticizer compositions and caulks or sealants containing  them are disclosed.  the plasticizer comprises (1) a water insolu­ ble adduct of ethylene or propylene oxide and an alkyl phenol  and (2) a polyester plasticizer and is preferably used in aqueous  latex caulks or sealants.

<DESCRIPTION>
plasticizer compositions comprising alkylene oxide-alkyl phenol adduct and polyester and caulking compositions containing them this invention is concerned with plasticizing compositions comprising certain alkylene oxide-alkyl phenol adducts and polyesters and caulking or sealant compositions containing them. the caulks or sealants may be used for filling structural joints in buildings. u.s. patents nos. 2 865 877 and 2 865 878 disclose coating compositions comprising a water soluble salt of a maleic anhydride/olefin copolymer and a water insoluble condensate of ethylene oxide and a c8- c18 alkyl phenol, the condensate containing an average of 1 to 5 oxyethylene units. the condensate may have a plasticizing effect on the copolymer and the two materials can serve as the sole binder in coatings, or can be used with acrylic polymers in dispersed or solubilized form. the water soluble salts are extremely hard and inflexible and are unsuitable as major components of caulks. u.s. patent no. 2 889 297 discloses permanently tacky polyvinylacetate adhesives plåasticized with polyglycol ethers of phenols which are similar to the adducts used in this invent ion. u.s. patent no. 3 554 942 discloses aqueous spackling or sealant compositions comprising water soluble acrylic copolymer and a water soluble cellulose ether. u.s. patent no. 3 561 996 discloses caulking compositions comprising thermoplastic polymer and, as adhesion promoter, certain silanes. one specific example in the patent describes a caulking composition of 82.6% solids formulated by mixing 195.1 kg of a 55% aqueous dispersion of an emulsion copolymer of 81.5% ethylacrylate, 15% methylmethacrylate and 3.5% itaconic acid; 4.29 kg of tert-octylphenoxypoly(39)ethoxy ethanol; 4.83 kg of sodium hexametaphosphate; 56.,34 kg of plasticiser for the copolymer (an oxypropylene ,derivative of m,p-cresylic acid); 12.21 kg mineral spirits; 0.576 kg of 30% aqueous polymethacrylic acid; 313.9 kg of pigment grade calcium carbonate extender and 7.81 kg of titanium dioxide pigment. u.s. patents 3 759 915, 3 786 020 and 3 919 146 disclose caulks and sealants comprising polymer containing units having air curable radicals. the compositions are generally organic solvent based and may also contain oil modified alkyd or maleic polyester plasticizers. as noted above, acrylic latex caulks have been proposed in the past in which a plasticizer is recommended, the plasticizer being an adduct of propylene oxide and cresol in a mole ratio of 6:1. aqueous caulks prepared from emulsion vehicles which are predominently acrylate or vinyl acetate require substan- tial amounts of plasticizer if they are to perform acceptably. the plasticizer enables the wet caulk to resist cracking as it dries and the dried, cured caulk to maintain its integrity and adhesion in the joint as it is subjected to stresses produced, for example, by temperature fluctuations. caulk properties determined in the laboratory which bear directly on performance under use conditions are hardness, low temperature flexibility, tensile strength and % elongation. in addition to these properties the plasticizer should lend itself to production of caulks of low and stable consistency at normal solids content and should have low cost. plasticizers presently in use in caulks are
