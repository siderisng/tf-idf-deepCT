<ABSTRACT>
a feeding device for a printed circuit board is used par­ ticularly for high fidelity and low noise amplifier etc.  for  minimizing the non-linear distortion occuring on the power  line the feeding device comprises a distributed capacity ele­ ment (14) consisting at least of a first and the second conduc­ tive strips (11, 12) separated from each other by a low loss  dielectric layer, leading-out terminals (a, b, c) provided to  said first conductive strip (11), a power source connected to at  least one leading-out terminal (c), an electrolytic condenser  (c₁) connected to the power source, and at least one non-­ polarized condenser (c₁) connected to the electrolytic con­ denser (c₁) in parallel, said second conductive strip (12) being  connected to an earthing circuit.  the distributed capacity  element (14) is formed in an oblong shape by folding and  coiling up the layered first and the second conductive strips  (11, 12), and leading-out terminals connected to the strips (11,  12).  said element (14) is enclosed in an container or encapsu­ lated by plastic material.
