<ABSTRACT>
a packing container e.  g.  for sterile milk is manu­ factured from laminated material which is provided with  a series of depressions having the form of a groove ex­ tending transversely from the edge of the web and which  laminated material is folded and sealed to the desired  container shape.  in the seal cut surfaces facing towards  the inside will occur which have to be sealed so as to  prevent the central paper layer of the material from ab­ sorbing some of the contents.  usually this is done by  means of a strip of a plastic material which is imperme­ able to liquid.  when the packing material is sterilized and  exposed to high temperatures these strips are often  damaged, because the moisture present in the paper  layer of the laminate is converted into vapour and pene­ trates the strip softened by the heat.  in accordance with  the invention the seal is now ventilated with the help of  ducts extending through the seal in such a manner that  the vapour can escape to the surrounding air without af­ fecting the sealing strip which thus remains intact and  can fulfil its intended sealing function.
