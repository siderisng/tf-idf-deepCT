<ABSTRACT>
A measurement method for the crack progress is proposed pre-retracted ner, preferably to break-mechanical material samples as a function of the load change number, in which changes are registered in the frequency response of a mechanical impedance of a sample to be tested. In a pulse resonance frequency that corresponds to the sample resonant frequency, a resonance increase of the mechanical impedance, defines as a quotient of the velocity of the tensioned sample and the pulsation force. Since in the progress of a crack in the sample whose spring constant also shrinks with the out-of-cross-sectional cross-sectional area, the frequency response of the sample undergoes a different frequencies (S). To carry out the method, it is proposed to register the phase () of the above impedance (z) or a dependent impedance to detect, but above the impedance amount under constant husbandry of the force acting on the sample or movement speed, but power - or move speed depending on the load change number and normalizes to the corresponding current force resp. Register the move size.
