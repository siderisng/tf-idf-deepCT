<ABSTRACT>
an inexpensive practice warhead (11) for use in con­ junction with combat rockets.  the novel warhead is basic­ ally the same configuration and weight as conventional  metal warheads, but is constructed of a shell (12, 22) of an  inexpensive plastics material, the weight difference being  made up by providing ballast means, preferably a steel rod  (14), within the hollow core of the warhead (11).
