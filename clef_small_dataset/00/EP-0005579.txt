<ABSTRACT>
a device for loading and unloading bales, sheafs or the like, which can be fitted onto a vehicle (1).  this device comprises a substantially vertical pivot secured by support means (5) onto the vehicle, a mounting (11) carried by this pivot via articulation means enabling it to rotate about a horizontal axis, and a guide boom (20) carried by this mounting so as to be capable of being oriented in all axes of space; this boom can be mounted slidably with respect to the mounting in order to give it an adjustable longitudinal position.  the device according to the invention is particularly suited for small farms to permit the loading of bales on uneven or sloping land, and their unloading for bringing them in, even over substantial heights.  <image>
