<ABSTRACT>
novel substituted imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds,  which have a high degree of anthelmintic activity, are disclosed.   the compounds have the formula:    where r₁ is hydrogen or lower alkyl and r₂ is lower alkoxy or  lower alkyl; or are pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition  salts of such compounds.  processes for the preparation of  such compounds are also disclosed as well as compositions  containing them as active ingredients and their use for the  treatment of helminthiasis.
