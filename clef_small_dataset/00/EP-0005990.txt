<ABSTRACT>
a method of repairing or modifying a saddle or seat for a  motor-cycle or cycle, having a metal base pan (102), resilient  filling or cushioning material supported by the pan (102), and  a cover or skin which covers the filling or cushioning  material, comprises: stripping away the existing filling or  cushioning material and the existing cover or skin from the  metal base pan (102), and then securing to said pan (102), by  securing means, a replacement unit (101) comprising a  moulded pan (105) of plastics material for seating on the  metal pan (102), resilient filling or cushioning material (106)  supported by said plastics pan (105), and a cover or skin (107)  which covers the filling or cushioning material (106) of said  replacement unit (101).  the method enables the original  cover or skin, and the original filling or cushioning material,  on the metal pan (102) to be replaced quickly and inexpensively.   since the metal pan (102) is retained, the pan (105) of  the replacement unit (101) can be inexpensively moulded  from light-duty plastics material.  in one embodiment the  securing means are screw means (109, 110); and in another  embodiment the securing means are clips.
