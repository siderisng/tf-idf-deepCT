<DESCRIPTION>
6-amino nicotinic acid i)rivatives this invention relates to a series of novel nicotinic acid derivatives to a method for their preparation and to their use as hypolipidaemic agents. accordingly the present iiivention provides a compound of formula (i): emi1.1 wherein r1ch,- is a c9 to c25alkyl or alkenyl group which is optionally branched or unbranched or includes a carbocyclic ring and r3 2 is -co2h or -ch2co2h or a pharniaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable group which is convert able in the human body into a-co2h or -ch2co2h group. most suitably r1c142- does not contain more than 20 carbon atoms. examples of suitable unbranched alkykl groups which r1ch9- may represent include 1-dodecyl, 1-tetradecyl, l-hexadecyl, l-octadecyl and l-eicosyl. examples of branched alkyl groups include 3-dodecyl, 3-tetradecyl, 3-llexlctecyl, -oct a.lecyl alld 3-eicosyl. ccjrb()cyclic riiigs \tliic-ii cm 13 may include include nay itmono- li- or polycyclic. examples of oi table mono-cyclic systelils includes cyclodecyl and cyclododecyl. examples of suitable bi-cyc lic systems include bicyclo [2.2.1] heptyl, bicyclo [2.2.1] hel)tenyl, bicyclu [2.2.2] octyl and bicycle [4.4.0] decyl. an example of a suitable polycycloalkyl group is adamantyl. preferably r1 is an unbranched c13 to c alkyl group. thus a preferred class of compounds within the scope of this invention has the general formula (i) wherein r is an unbranched c13 to c17 alkyl group and 2 is as previously defined with reference to formula (1). an example of a compound of this preferred class is 6-(n-hexadecylamino)-nicotinic acid. examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the -co2h and -ch2co2h include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, particularly sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts. compounds of general formula (i) also form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts with appropriate acids. examples of suitable acids include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulphuric, phosphoric and nitric acid and organic acids such as lower alkanoic acids (e.g. acetic and propionic), glycollic pyruvic, malonic, succinic, malic, tartaric and citric acids. the term pharmaceutically acceptable groups which are convertable in the human body into a -co2h or -ch2co2h group means a group which is hydrolysed or is metabolised in some other way to a -co2h or -ch2co2h group, and is such that the compound of formula (i) is pharmaceutically acceptable. groups which are convertable by hydrolysis to the -co2h or -ch2co2h group include pharmaceutically acceptable esters. examples of such esters include the c1 to c6 alkyl esters, in particular the methyl, ethyl and n-propyl esters. other suitable esters include for example alkoxyalkyl esters such as methoxymethyl esters; acyloxyalkyl esters such as acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a-acetoxyethyl, cl- acetoxybenzyl and a-pivaloyloxvethvl esters; alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, such as ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl; and lactone, thiolactone and dithiolactone esters, i.e. ester groups of formula (ii): emi3.1 wherein x' and y' are oxygen or sulphur and z' is an ethylene group or a 1,2-phenylene group optionally substituted by c1 - c6 alkoxy, halogen or nitro. preferred ester groups are the phthalidyl and 3,4-dimethoxy phthalidyl esters. typical of groups which are metabolisable to -co2h and -ch2c02h groups are terminal methyl
