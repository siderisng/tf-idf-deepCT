<ABSTRACT>
a method of cooking meat in a microwave oven by determining  the mean internal temperature of the meat which  is indicative of the internal doneness of meat as a function  of sensed and sampled time dependent «in-situ» humidity  and temperature environmental conditions of the microwave  oven heating cavity.  the mean internal temperature  of the meat is determined as a function of its initial temperature,  the net evaporative heat loss, the microwave power  absorption factor and the net convective heat loss.
