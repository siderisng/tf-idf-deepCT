<ABSTRACT>
data processing apparatus is provided with a paging  facility constrained in that the number of pages of any group  of pages (defined by a specific bit pattern is a first subset of  virtual address bits) in residence in the direct access data store  is limited to n.  the address translation apparatus included  comprises two table look-up mechanisms arranged to main­ tain a mapping of selected virtual to real address relationships  of pages in residence, the first table look-up mechanism hav­ ing c/n addressable locations of n fields and the second table  look-up mechanism having c single field addressable loca­ tions, when c is the maximum number of pages in residence,  so that, for a filled direct access data store there is one field in  each table look-up mechanism for each page in residence.   both table look-up mechanisms are addressed by the first  subset of bits of a virtual address presented for translation  and, in addition, the second table look-up mechanism is  addressed in response to the operations of the first table  look-up mechanism.  either the first or the second table look-­ up mechanism generates, the real page addresses appropri­ ate to the current mapping.  the first table look-up mechanism  contains entries each identifying the states of a second subset  of virtual address bits of pages of the associated group in  residence.  the second subset bits of a virtual address pre­ sented for translation are compared with all the output fields  of the first table look-up mechanism using n compare circuits,  outputting to the second table look-up addressing mechan­ ism.  the remaining page address bit positions of the pre­ sented virtual address are compared with the output of the  second table look-up mechanism, the fields of the second  table look-up mechanism containing such remaining virtual  address bits appropriate to the pages in residence.  if either  comparator fails to detect an equality a miss is registered and  the second table look-up mechanism is only exercised in rela­ tion to potential hits.
