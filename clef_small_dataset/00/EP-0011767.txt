<ABSTRACT>
a process and a microorganism for synthesizing cellulase  enzymes are described.  the microorganism is a mutant strain  of an ascomycete fungus capable of synthesizing cellulases.   the synthesis of cellulases by the mutant is nonrepressed by  glycerol, repressed by glucose but not subject to postrepres­ sion lag, and inducible to high levels by lactose.  furthermore,  the combination of lactose with xylose elicits maximum cel­ lulase synthesis by the mutant.
