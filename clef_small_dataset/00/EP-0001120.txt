<ABSTRACT>
disclosed herein is a fluid pressure indicator for providing visual indication of the magnitude of a fluid pressure condition.  the indicator comprises an optical element including a front surface for receiving ambient light and a rear, light-reflecting portion having three mutually perpendicular surfaces which define a cube corner having an apex remote from the front surface, and a one-piece, resilient, imperforate diaphragm in cooperative relationship with the rear, light-reflecting portion of the optical element, to provide a chamber between the interior of the diaphragm and the three perpendicular surfaces.  the diaphragm is normally not in optical engagement with the three perpendicular surfaces, but is resiliently deformed into such optical engagement upon the application of a positive fluid pressure differential to the exterior of the diaphragm.
