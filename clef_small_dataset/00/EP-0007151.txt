<ABSTRACT>
a multi-functioning hydraulic transmission control circuit  including interacting valve mechanism parts which, in  response to a shift being called for in a clutch-cylinder-­ controlled multi-speed transmission (10), inaugurate a fill  pressure flow to the clutch cylinders concerned, prior to the  subsequent fluid pressure rise effected therein; thereafter,  upon completion of the fill, the parts modulate pressure rise of  the hydraulic clutch fluid from and at approximately actual  clutch fill pressure up to, and remaining at, the final pressure  of engagement.  these functions including full resetting of the  parts at the beginning of each shift, and a lesser and a least  gradual pressure rise afforded during respective second and  third speed upshifts, are all accomplished by and among a  pair of direction-selector and orificed-speed-selector valve  spools connected to the transmission clutch cylinders to  direct valve fluid output thereto selectively, and also 1st,  dump valve (174), 2d, simulated clutch piston (194), 3d, load  piston (164), 4th, modulator valve (58), and 5th, interacting  spring parts (88) collectively providing said directed valve  fluid output, all in a valve bore (34) common thereto, and  arranged therein with the dump valve (174) part confronted at  one side by the simulated clutch piston part (164) so as to  define mutually therewith a differential pressure chamber (80)  in the bore (34), and confronted at the other side by a first side  of the load piston part (164) so as to define mutually with that  first side a signal pressure chamber (82) in the bore (34), and  with an opposite side of the load piston part (164) spacedly  confronting the modulator valve part (58) so that they mutu­ ally engage therebetween the interacting spring parts (88) in  the common bore (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
transmission clutches with fully-pp.#setting nodulator-load piston the present invention relates to hydraulic controls for smoothly effecting shifting of a vehicle transmission of the type in which the shifting power is provided by hydraulic pressure applied in the transmission itself, i.e., to effect a smooth power-shi±t. there is described herein a multi-functioning hydraulic transmission control circuit including interacting valve mechanism parts which, in response to a shift being called for in a clutch-cylinder-controlled multi-speed transmission, inaugurate a fill pressure flow to the clutch cylinders concerned, prior to the subsequent fluid pressure rise effected therein; thereafter, upon completion of the fill, the parts modulate pressure rise of the hydraulic clutch fluid from and at approximately actual clutch fil) pressure up to, and remaining at, the final pressure of en engagement. the above parts, which shift position either directly or indirectly in response to position changes made to a transmission shift lever by an operator, comprise 1st speed selector and 2d direction selector valve spools connected to the transmission clutch cylinders to direct valve fluid output thereto selectively, and also 3d dump valve, 4th a load piston, 5th another piston, 6th a modulator valve, and 7th interacting spring parts collectively providing said directed valve fluid output, all in a bore common thereto, and arranged therein with the dump valve part confronted at one side by the other piston part, 5th above, so as to define mutually therewith a differential pressure chamber in the bore, and confronted at the other side by a first side of the load piston part so as to define mutually with that first side a signal pressure chamber in the bore, and with an opposite side of the load piston part spacedly confronting the modulator valve part so that they mutually engage therebetween the interacting spring parts, 7th above, in the common bore. according to past transmission practices in tractors and other vehicles in connection with controlled rate of rise valve assemblies each including a modulator valve and an associated load piston therefor, the speed and direction clutches provided in the transmission have been operated through the controlled rate of rise valve assembly to cushion clutch engagement. in tractor transmissions affording multi-speed ranges both forward and reverse, it is neither necessary nor desirable that the pressure rise be as gradual in other transmission speed settings aside from the high torque, first speed which tends to engage jerkily. in other words as soon as it is upshifted out of first, a transmission works at a disadvantage without having a lesser and a least gradual pressure rise afforded during its re spective second and third speed upshifts. and all the more it is a disadvantage that the rate of rise valve assembly i hydraulically spaced a long distance away from the transmission controlled thereby so that the valve assembly in a sense operates too remotely from, and altogether ignorantly of, the actual clutch fill pressure existing in the transmission itself. the latter disadvantage manifests itself in the functioning of the modulator
