<ABSTRACT>
In a mixer for thicknesses, z. b. Filter cake, sludge o. Like. With a fixed passage tank (24), in the container, a shaft occupied with mixing tools (8, 9). so that the thick matter can be conveyed and mixed from a task opening (10) to a discharge opening (56) and, if necessary, crushed foreign bodies, so that a substrate further from the mixer is released by pipelines, serve as a mixing mechanism, several multi-wing knife screws (11) , 27a), which cooperate with fixed, in planes (II, IV) between the planes (I, III) of the knife screws (11, 27) arranged zipper (33-35; 40-42). The shaft (8) is extended in a passing in the passage direction housing (4), in which housing fixed guide ribs (53) and arranged in succession radial planes arranged fixed knives (62, 63) and housing fixed vanes (54, 55) are arranged one behind the other. There are shaft-resistant tape screw segments (48, 49) and between the following planes of the fixed parts (62, 63; 54, 55) shaft strip (70 -72; 60) are located prior to the fixed measurers (62, 63) and between the following planes. The mixer can also be used as a stuffing device for a closed to the discharge (56) of the narrowing housing cylinder pump.
