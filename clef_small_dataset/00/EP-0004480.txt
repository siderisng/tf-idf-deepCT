<ABSTRACT>
a process for treating papermaking fabrics, in particular  dryer fabrics, includes, coating the back surface of the  fabric with a thickened resin mixture.  to reduce the air  permeability of a woven dryer fabric, the fabric is impregnated  within a thickened resin mixture to close up a portion  of the interstices between the woven yarns.  by applying  a thickened resin mixture having a viscosity of between  1,000 and 5,000 centipoise to the back surface of the dryer  fabric, the fabric is impregnated in a single pass with a  sufficient quantity of the mixture to reduce the air permeability  to the desirable level.  the fabric (8) is drawn over a treating roller (9) in  contact with a roller (15) partially immersed in a pool (10)  of the resin mixture.  the fabric (8) is held against the roller  (9) with the assistance of a pressure roller (12) and a doctor  knife (13) is arranged downstream of the roller (12)  (figure 4).
