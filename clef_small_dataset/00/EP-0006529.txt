<ABSTRACT>
Get in crushing machines, especially in meat processing, occasionally hard objects such as meat hooks, screws, packages and the like. In order to free the crushing material of such unwanted hard objects, and in particular for the protection of or cutting sets (4, 5) and possiblyUpstream Stauffinger (14) is placed on the drive shaft (7) of the or the cutting blade a centrifugal disc (11) with fang groove (12).Due to the centrifugal force, these hard objects get into the fang groove, from which they can be removed after completion of the crushing and shutdown of the machine.In a preferred manner, only a centrifugal disc is used, which, seen in the direction of contact, is connected upstream of the first cutting set.The crushing material can only reach the or the cutting sets via the openings (16) of the centrifugal disc.
