<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for reducing the scattered light in photometric measurements, in particular in the photometric measurement of hemoglobin and a reagent for carrying out the method.A measuring preparation suspension is added beige, which reduces the difference between, the refractive index of the suspension means and the middle suscal index of the suspended phases.A reagent for photometric determination of hemoglobin consists of a lysierant, a means for modifying the refractive index, a means for stabilizing the leukocytes and a solvent.The reagent is added as the addition of a suspension of blood cells in an isotonic solvent.
