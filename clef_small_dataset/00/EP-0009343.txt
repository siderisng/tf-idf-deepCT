<ABSTRACT>
a continuously variable transmission mechanism in足 corporates first and second co-axial spaced rollers (17 and  22), roller (17) being an input.  a variable ratio driving con足 nection is established between rollers (17 and 22) by discs  (23 and 27) which have flat faces engaged with the peri足 pheries of the rollers.  axial movement of the assembly of  discs varies their effective diameter and thus the drive ratio.   a planetary gear set (34) has one element (35) rotatable  with roller (17), a second element (36) rotatable with roller  (22) and the third element constituted by carrier (37) and  planet gear (38) connected to an output shaft (18).  the  engagement load between the rollers and discs is controlled  in response to the torque being transmitted by a torque  responsive connection between a disc carrier (26) and the  casing (12) and incorporating threaded stub shaft (29)  rotatable by pegs (30 and 32).  the transmission provides a  range of transmission ratios in a forward and reverse direc足 tion.
