<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an anticoagulant agent which  acts without cofactor and selectively inhibits thrombin, and to  pharmaceutical preparations containing said agent.  the anticoagulant agent is prepared by sulphatation of a  polysaccharide obtained by precipitation from the decoction  of mollusca, preferably common sea mussels.  sulphatation is  preferably achieved with chlorosulphonic acid in the presence  of pyridine.

<DESCRIPTION>
anticoagulant agent, process for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical preparatitns containing sane. the present invention deals with anticoagulants, i.e. drugs that inhibit blood coagulation, and more specifically, with a new anticoagulant, with a method of preparing it and with pharmaceutical preparations containing same. blood coagulation is controlled by a complicated mechanism which has only been partly investigated even today. according to the cascade theory, coagulation occurs through the formation of insoluble fibrin under the interaction of a number of various factors. according to this theory, the final step in the coagulation process implies that a factor x is activated to factor xa, whereupon this activated factor xa enables blood prothrombin to be converted into the enzyme thrombin which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. normally, blood coagulation is counteracted by certain substances interfering in the coagulation process, whereby coagulation is inhibited. more specifically, coagulation is counteracted by a protein called antithrombin iii (at iii) which slowly neutralizes and inhibits thrombin and factor xa. normally, the blood concentration of at iii is enough to inhibit coagulation and to maintain blood in a sufficiently fluid state. it has been established that the action of at 12:; is highly accelerated by so-called heparin, which is a sulfated mucopolysaccharide. heparin was first discovered in liver substance by the american w.h. howell in 1916. later, concentrations of heparin were also found in the lungs and gut. pure heparin was first prepared by e. jorpes. heparin acts by building a complex with at iii, and this complex is highly effective in inhibiting above all the activation of factor xa but also, though to a much lesser extent, the enzyme thrombin. it is to be noted that heparin alone exerts no anticoagulant action. combination with at iii, the heparin factor, is necessary it is in many circumstances desirable to be able to prevent normal coagulation, for example in vivo in operative surgery as well as in post-operative treatment to prevent thrombosis (formation of emboli). it is even desirable to prevent coagulation in vitro, for instance in blood analysis tests in the laboratory. this can be achieved by the addition of heparin which, together with cofactor at iii, effectively inhibits clotting particularly in blood analysis tests in the laboratory, clotting is inhibited in a practical manner by coating the inside of test tubes, in which blood is collected, with heparin. prophylactic treatment for the prevention of post-operative thrombosis is achieved by the administration of low doses of heparin. it has been shown, however, that treatment is often not as effective as expected. this is due to 2 reasons. firstly, heparin is, as already mentioned, dependent on a cofactor (at iii) for its activity. and even if heparin is given in a dosage which per se may be adequate in inhibiting thrombosis, treatment is ineffective unless cofactor at iii is present in a sufficient quantity. in this connection it has been shown that at iii concentrations below normal levels occur in a number of cases, e.g.
