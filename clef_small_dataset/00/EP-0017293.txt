<ABSTRACT>
complex suspension fertilizers are prepared by digestÂ­ ing phosphate rock with nitric acid, removing calcium from  the resulting slurry and ammoniating the remaining liquid in  at least three steps at successively lower temperatures, and  quickly cooling, preferably within less than 5 seconds, the  reaction liquid obtained in the second neutralisation step.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for preparing complex suspension fertilizers the invention relates to a process for preparing complex suspension fertilizers by ammoniation of a liquid obtained by digestion of phosphate rock with nitric acid and complete or substantial removal of the calcium. such a process is known from the dutch applications laid open to public inspection nos. 6.610.521 and 6.818.164. in the process described in the dutch application laid open to public inspection, no, 6.610.521, a large part of the calcium is crystallized out from the digestion liquor as calcium nitrate tetrahydrate by cooling, upon which the crystals are separated and, with firm stirring, the remaining mother liquor is put in an already neutralized solution together with ammonia, while a ph of 6-8 is maintained at a temperature of 10-70 c. in the process described in the dutch application laid open to public inspection, no. 6.818.164, the phosphate rock is digested with nitric acid in the presence of ammonium bisulphate so that the calcium precipitates as calcium sulphate dihydrate. the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is ammoniated. a drawback in these known processes is that in a one-step ammoniation of the digestion liquor to a product of a ph of > 6 it will be difficult to control the crystallization process. there will be a strong formation of coarse crystals1 resulting in a product suspension which shows little homogeneity and which is therefore less stable. this phenomenon will be stronger as the ammonium nitrate content of the mixture is greater. another draw-back in the known processes is that the impurities in the digestion liquor originating from the phosphate rock may give rise to the formation of gel-like compounds, which will result in a strong increase in the viscosity of the product. moreover, when applying some kinds of rock phosphate, a greater or smaller quantity of citrate-insoluble tricalcium phosphate and/or fluor apatite is formed in the ammoniation by the calcium still present, which means a loss of nutrient phosphate. finally, the known processes also have the drawback that in a one-step ammoniation to a-ph > 6 there will be a strong temperature increase, resulting in a escape of relatively large quantities of ammonia. now, the invention provides a process which makes it possible for the liquid obtained in a digestion of phosphate rock with nitric acid, with all or much of the calcium removed from it, to be converted into stable, concentrated suspension fertilizers, and in which the above-mentioned drawbacks occure hardly or not at all. this is achieved, according to the invention, by ammoniation of the digestion liquid in at least three neutralization steps, in which process the temperature in each neutralization step is lower than the temperature in the proceding step and the reaction liquid is quickly cooled between the second and the third neutralization step with formation of a suspension. the digestion liquid to be applied in the process according to the invention may have been obtained in various ways, known as such, for instance, as described above, by substantial
