<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a spinning target (10)  which is accurately responsive to the force of impact of a  pinball (14) on the target (10).  a generally flat target ele­ ment (16) is suspended above a playfield (12) so that it  is rotatable about an axis parallel to the playfield (12) and  sufficiently above the field so that the pinball (14) can  pass below when the target element (16) is in a horizontal  configuration.  the target element (16) has a principal axis  of inertia generally coincident with the axis of rotation of  the target element (16).  the target element (16) is biased  so that it is maintained in a vertical configuration until im­ pacted by the pinball (14).  a pair of weights (17, 18)  which have a mass density greater than the mass density  of the target element (16) are embedded in the target ele­ ment (16) in its respective extremities.  the weights (17,  18) are symmetrically disposed relative to and remote from  the principal axis of the target element (16).  the target  element (16) together with the weights (17, 18) has a re­ latively high moment of inertia to sustain rotation of the  target element (16) proportionate to the force of impact  of the pinball (14) on the target element (16).  the number  of revolutions of the target element (16) are tabulated to  provide a score which is proportional to the force of im­ pact of the pinball (14) on the target (10).
