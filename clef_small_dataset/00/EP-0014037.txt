<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector for use in establishing electri­ cal connections to the conductors of a flat cable compris­ es a first housing member (1) carrying a plurality of ter­ minals (2) each having a conductor-receiving portion (4)  comprising a pair of spaced arms (5) extending normally of  the one face of the first housing member (1), the arms hav­ ing opposed edges defining a conductor-receiving slot (6)  and having pointed extremities for piercing the insulating  material (102) of the cable, and a second housing member  (7) having a plurality of holes (8) extending inwardly from  one face thereof each to receive the arms (5) of a respec­ tive one of the terminals (2) carried by the first housing  member (1), the arms (5) of the conductor-receiving por­ tion (4) of each terminal (2) being formed adjacent their  free ends with outwardly directed projections (9) which are  an interference fit in the associated hole (8) in the second  housing member (7), and each arm (5) of each terminal (2)  in use engaging the second housing member (7), not only  at the projection (9) on the arm but also at a second posi­ tion (y) adjacent the engagement between the arm (5) and  a conductor (101) of the cable received in the slot (6) par­ tially defined by the arm, thereby to ensure reliable con­ nection between the terminal (2) and the associated con­ ductor (101).  the connector of this invention has the advantage  that the second position of engagement (y) between each  arm (5) of each terminal (2) and the second housing mem­ ber (7) serves to relieve the stresses induced in the arms  (5) by the engagement between the projections (9) on the  arms and the second housing member (7), this enhancing  the contact between the arms (5) and the conductors (101)  and ensuring reliable electrical connections.
