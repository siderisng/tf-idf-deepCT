<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a method, system and apparatus for  cutting a profile, such as a cigar wrapper, from a natural leaf,  such as a tobacco leaf, wherein the leaf is spread and supported  on a support surface in a random position (40).   thereafter, a leaf facsimile or image, including the leaf outline  and surface imperfections, is developed (70) and at least  one cut position for the wrapper is located in an area excluding  the leaf outline and surface imperfections (80).  this cut  position is recorded and converted to digital data (100).  the  wrapper is then cut from the leaf at an actual cut position  corresponding to the located cut position determined by the  digital data (104).  also, the facsimile is created by a back  lighting arrangement which illuminates color variations and  surface imperfections, as well as the leaf outline, so that leaf  colour variations can be included in the facsimile or image.
