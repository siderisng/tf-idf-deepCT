<ABSTRACT>
the air hammer is of the type employing a body hav足 ing a first portion (1) with a central bore (20) and a piston  (21) reciprocable in the bore (20) by pressurised air under  control of an automatic valve (25).  the body has a second  or muffler portion (7) which embraces the first portion (1)  and is operative to muffle the noise created by exhaust air  from the bore (20).  the muffler portion (7) is provided with  pressurised air passage means (59) through which the  pressurised air must pass for causing operation of the pi足 ston (21).  the passage means (59) are so arranged that  removal of the muffler portion (7) from the body (1) dis足 rupts the supply of pressurised air to the piston (21) and  thereby renders the hammer inoperative.  headers (2, 4) are  provided on the ends of the first body portion (1) and are  drawn tightly against the ends of this and muffler portion  (7) by tie bolts (57, 58) which extend through the passages  (59, 60) respectively, in the muffler portion (7).  the passa足 ges (59, 60) are of larger diameter than the associated  bolts (57,58) and the clearance space between one of the  through passages (59) and the associated bolt (57) acts to  deliver live air to the piston, to accumulate pressurised air,  and to deliver pressurised air for actuating the automatic  valve (25).
