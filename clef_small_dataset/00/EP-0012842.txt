<ABSTRACT>
the specification describes an assembly of a pair of  magnetic transducers (400) held substantially in contact with  opposite sides of a flexible magnetic disk wherein each transÂ­ ducer has a pair of disk contacting lands (404,406) each  broadening from the leading edge (404b) to the trailing edge  (404c), with the leading edge (404b) and side edge (404d) of  each land being gradually blended into the surrounding active  surface of the transducer and with the trailing edge (404c) of  the land being sharp.  a first one (404) of the lands of each  transducer has a read/write magnetic gap (28u) in it, and in  use (this land is located opposite the second land (not having  the read/write gap in it) of the other transducer, the second  land being wider than the first land in each case.  the centres  of the opposing lands are in alignment, the centres being  located on a plane passing through the read/write gaps of the  transducers,
