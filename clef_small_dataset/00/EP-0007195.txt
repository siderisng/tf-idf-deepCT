<ABSTRACT>
a lactone of the formula    where r is alkylene having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, is  incorporated in a urethane prepolymer system as a viscosity  modifier.  a method of making a cured polyurethane article  and compositions and two-part systems containing compoÂ­ nents of the prepolymer system are disclosed.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
polyurethane spray composition containing lactone viscosity modifier this invention relates to a method of king a poly ureth2ne, composition useful in such method, and a polyurethane produced by such method. polyurethanes generally comprise as essential components a polyol such as a higher molecular weight glycol, a polyisocyanate such as a diisocyanate, and a curative or chain extender such as a relatively low molecular weight polyamine or polyol. there are numerous applications for polyurethanes which are prepared by spray methods especially when it is desired to apply a coating of polyurethane onto z surface. the two main spray methods are: 1) one-shox system; and, 2) prepolymer system. in the one-shot system usually two low viscosity streams of materials are employed, namely: a) polyisocyanate; and, b) mixture of polyol and curative. the one-shot system suffers certain deficiencies especially th sensitivity of the polyisocyanate to moisture, under humid conditions, even at 2 relatively short period of exposure to moisture in the air the highly concentrated and reactive polyisocyanate tends to combine with the water present leading to extensive foaming in the resultant polyurethane. the advantages include working with low viscosity liquid materials and the general solubility of curatives in the polyols. the prepolymer system (2) essentially employs two ingredient feed streams, namely: (i) polyurethane prepolymer; and, (ii) curative(s); wherein (i) is a reaction product of polywsocyanate and a suitable polyol having residual isocyanate functionality, and (ii) is a polyamine or polyol essentially used for providing the desired amount of chain extension and/or crosslinking. the disadvantage of this system ltes in the rather high viscosity of such prepolymers (i) and the oftentimes solid nature of the curative. it has been the practice to add certain inert volatile organic solvents in order to reduce the viscosity of (i) and place (ii) into solution. the prepoly=er system leads to a product having physical properties superior to those of the one-shot system because in the latter the polyol and curatives compete with each other in the reaction with polyisocyanate, yet, the solvents added (about 30 to 70% by volume) such as toluene, rethyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, xylene etc., create hazards to human health because of toxicity or chances of explosion and fires. in addition, these solvents may be lost less costly ventilation and recovery systems are inslall ed, this invention relates to the use of a "viscosity modifier" which when added to a urethane prepolymer system, sufficiently decreases viscosity and readily dissolves or solvates useful polyurethane curatives so that the two components- prepolymer and curative- can be readily metered, mixed, and sprayed using conventional commercial spray equipment. rrrne viscosity modifier employed in the invention is a lactone which essetially is not volatile and hence the system is free of volatile solverits. the invention accordingly pertains to the use of a lactone as a non-volatile modifier to dissolve solid components and to reduce viscosity of urethane prepolymer systems such that they are sprayable on conventional equipment. a prior commercially available curative for poly urethane prepolymer is a
