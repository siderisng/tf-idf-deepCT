<ABSTRACT>
soft solders, namely solder alloys melting at a temperature  below about 350Â°c. , are generally preferred to the higher  melting point hard solders and to the brazing and welding  alloys for soldering a joint between a member made of  aluminium or aluminium alloy and another member which  may or may not be of aluminium or an aluminium alloy.   however a disadvantage arising from this use of soft solders  is that the corrosion resistance of such joints tends to be  unsatisfactory.  to deal with this problem, the invention provides a flux  containing as one of the essential constituents thereof a silver  halide which, when used in conjunction with a conventional  lead/tin soft solder alloy, ensures that silver is deposited at  the joint interface to prevent corrosion.
