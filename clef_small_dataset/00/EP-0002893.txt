<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to the use of aplasmomycin,  boromycin and acylated and hydrogenated derivatives  thereof for modifying rumen metabolism in domestic ruminant  animals, by reducing the proportion of methane  formed, and increasing the proportion of propionate at the  expense of methane and/or acetate.  this modification of  rumen metabolism is believed to improve growth in ruminant  animals.  the disclosure also describes compositions  which may be used in the claimed method, an improved  process for the production of aplasmomycin, and novel  analogs of aplasmomycin and boromycin together with  processes for their manufacture.
