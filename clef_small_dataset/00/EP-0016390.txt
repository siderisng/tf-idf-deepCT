<ABSTRACT>
In a shield mechanism for movement of heavy loads (22), a platform (21) of two bearings (8; 11) is drained, the support (8) comprises two shelling circuits (7). The load (22) is eccentrically to the center plane between the supports (8; 11) and above the support (8). A length-modified lifting arm (5) is connected to a foot (10) and the platform (21) with a foot (10) and with the platform (21) and can be moved from two double-acting hydraulic piston-cylinder units (3; 4) so that he changes his inclination in two levels. For change of position, the platform (21) is first inclined by extending the lift arm (5) at an angle against the load. One of the piston-cylinder units (3; 4) is then operated for oscillation of the lift arm (5) so that the platform (21) is drawn at one end. Subsequently, the platform (21) is horizontally outlined and the process is arbitrarily often.
