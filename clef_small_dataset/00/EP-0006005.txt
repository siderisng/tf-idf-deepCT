<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for detecting and locating a fault in an electric  cable using a pulse-echo technique comprises means for  injecting step function or single pulses into a cable, under  two different conditions of the cable, and means for retrieving  the signals obtained under the two said conditions,  comparing them and thus locating the position of the fault.   preferably, the apparatus also includes means for detecting  whether the cable is "live and healthy" or "live and faulty"  by obtaining a digital pulse signal indicating that a voltage is  present on the cable, obtaining a second digital pulse signal  indicating by a series of pulses when the current in the cable  is above the normal load current and gating these two  signals in a nand gate to obtain a signal representing the  state of the cable.
