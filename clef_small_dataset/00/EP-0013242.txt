<ABSTRACT>
An electron beam (1) is subjected to a constant magnetic field b in the directed time following the axis XX, according to which it propagates, and the electromagnetic field of resonant volumes placed on its path.These volumes are excited to the cyclotonic frequency FC electrons in field B by a source coupled by the antenna (5).A power over a frequency close to a multiple NFC of the cyclotron frequency is collected in the load (8) coupled by (6).In the example, the volumes consist of a single guide (20) whose circular section (2) was deformed according to (3) and (4);The electron beam is from the cannon (19, 12, 14).Application: power generators of power over a few tens of gigahertz, for radar in particular.
