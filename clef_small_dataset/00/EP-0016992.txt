<ABSTRACT>
process and installation for regeneration of ion ex­ change resins (a¹) during the alkali-magnesium process  with diluted and heated molasses (4) and with fresh re­ agent containing magnesium ions (5).  the ion chloride  polluted effluents are so eliminated, the magnesium cations  in the molasses (f) are decreased and fresh reagent con­ sumption is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
process and installation for regeneration of ion exchange resins during the alkali-magnesium process through molasses regeneration obtained from this process, enriched with fresh regenerating-salts-. it is well known that sugar mills use ion exchange resins, capable of partially replacing the most molassige nic cations, such sodium and potassium by one less molas sigenic cation, like magnesium, to increase the saccharose content. this procedure is currently emloyed by using a cation resin, like amberlite ir 122 s, in the form of magnesium, by percolation of a magnesium chlori de solution through the resin (the quentin process ag resulting from a german patent dp 974408). subsequently the cations, as for example sodium and/or potassium, are replaced by the magnesium cations (known quentin process) by letting the sugar juice containing the highest molassigenic cations percolate on the ion exchange resin in the above mentioned form. \hen the resins are depleted, they must be regenerated and, with the aforesaid procedure, this regeneration is currently obtained by percolation of a magnesium chlori de solution which triggers the exchange and the substitution of the magnesium by sodium and/or potassium, resulting in great quantities of chloride ions in the ef fluents. this high concentration rate of chloride ions in the ef fluents is a great drawback, since the permissible limit stated by the anti-pollution laws is exceeded, while it is impossible, for obvious economic reasons, to eliminate this concentration chemicallyxfrom the effluents. thus the effluents must be kept in large besins and drained little by little, but they shall represent a pollution source. a second drawback lies in current sugar juice treatment with resins in the alkali-magnesium process. this juio ce, after treatment, is further processed for sugar recovery, the final product, molasses, has an indicatory content of approximately 80% of magnesium ion released during the ion exchange. this high maghesium content prevents the traditional conversion or utilisation of molasses which, as is known, is a high energy product. the procedure regarding this invention greatly reduces, or eliminates, the aforesaid drawbackes since the cloride ions containing polluting effluents are totally eliminated thus obtaining molasses having a low magnesium content with the advantage of noticeably reducing the consumption of the fresh regenerating product such as magnesium chloride. according to the procedure of this invention, the regeneration of the depleted resins is ached through percollation of the molasses derived from treatment of the previous sugar juice with resins and containing, as has been stated before, a high percentage of magnesium, pro 'vided-a proper amount of fresh reagent is added to the molasses. this process is earmarked by the fact that in order tp regenerate the ion exchanging resins such as amberlite ir 122 s in the form of magnesium, the molasses obtained after crystallization of the juices previously treated with these resins is percolated since the molasses contains for indicatory purposes, about 80%o of the magnesium required to regenerate the resin in the required form, i.e. in the form of magnesium. it is however necessary to add an amount

claims   1. procedure for the regeneration of ion exchange resins where these resins treat, through alkali-magnesium exchan ge, sugar juices yielding molasses as a final product with a high magnesium content, while the resins are depleted due to the enrichment of sodium and/or potassium ions with   magnesium    loss, characterized by the fact that regeneration of the resin occours through percolation of the molasses containing magnesium ions with fresh rea gent additives containing magnesium ions such as   b: :agne-    sium chloride, causing ion exchange and regenerating the resins with magnesium ion, while the sodium and/or potas sium ions return to the molasses for the purpose of eliminating the effluents polluted by the chloride ions so that the molasses can be recovered and can be easily used and also to reduce fresh reagent   consumption.      2. procedure, as described under claim 1, characterized by the fact that the molasses used as a regenerating agent contains, for indicatory purposes, about   80%    of maghesium ions needed for resin regeneration.   3. procedure ad described under claim 1 and 2, characte rized by the fact that the fresh reagent, such as   wiagne-    sium chloride, is added to the molasses in the quantity of about   20%,    mentioned for indicatory purposes, in order to reach the total amount of magnesium ions needed for resin regeneration.    4. procedure ad described under claim 1, characterized by the fact that the molasses before the regeneration is properly diluted and heated, while it is properly concentrated after the regeneration process.   5. procedure as described under claim 1, characterized  by the fact that between ion exchange treatment and regeneration and vice-versa, methodical washing operations are contemplated so as to prevent the fluids from mixing.   6. installation for the regeneration of ion exchange resins, according to the needs of the procedure as descri bed under claim 1 and subsequent claims.   7. procedure and equipment as briefly described and illustrated schematically for   exempliyng    purposes, in the enclosed drawing, including the variations which may be required in individual cases to reach the above mentioned purposes.
