<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for determining the presence of predetermined constituents such as potassium ions, calcium ions, or gases in a liquid such as blood, beer, milk or effluent, in which the liquid is passed through a helical passage partly defined by membrane means through which the desired constituents may pass.  the desired constituents which pass through the membrane are subsequently analysed by analytical means which is thereby not contaminated by other constituents of the liquid under test.
