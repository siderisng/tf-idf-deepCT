<ABSTRACT>
process for improving the strength characteristics of  a wire (1) composed of an austenitic metal alloy having an  md temperature of no higher than about 100° c and an ms  temperature of no higher than about minus 100° c, com­ prising the steps of:   a) deforming the wire (1) at a strain of at least about  10 percent and at a temperature of between about md minus  50° c and md plus 50° c, so that the wire (1) has a mar­ tensite phase of no greater than about 10 percent by volume  and an austenite phase of at least about 90 percent by  volume and a yield strength of between about 130,000 and  230,000 psi;   b) cooling the wire (1) to a temperature no higher  than about minus 75° c; and   c) drawing the cooled wire (1) so that the wire has  a martensite phase of at least about 50 percent by volume  and an austenite phase of at least about 10 percent by  volume.  the drawing of step (c) is carried out by drawing the  wire (1) through two dies (5, 6) placed in series so that  the cross-sectional area of the wire (1) is reduced by the  first die (5) by a percentage between about 8 and 15 per­ cent and the cross-sectional area of the reduced wire is  further reduced by the second die (6) by a percentage  in between about 8 and 15 percent based on the area of the  wire exiting the first die (5).
