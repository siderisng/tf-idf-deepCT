<ABSTRACT>
in a gas turbine engine, the main air flow path leads  through a compressor (14), a recuperative heat exchanger  (24), a combustor (20), where fuel is injected and burnt, a  turbine (16), which drives the compressor (14), and then  back through the heat exchanger (24).  a small portion of  the air is diverted through a conduit (32) to the nozzle (28)  through which the fuel is injected; this air serves to atom­ ise the fuel.  the conduit (32) leads through a boost com­ pressor system (12), which, if the air pressure available for  atomisation of the fuel would otherwise be inadequate,  raises the pressure of the air supplied to the nozzle (28).
