<ABSTRACT>
A method for the catalytic preparation of polymers or copolymers of alpha-olefins having a high indication of isotacticity by polymerization of c₃ alpha-olefin, sequenced copolymerization of such alpha-olefins between them and / or with ethylene , or copolymerization of mixtures of such alpha-olefins between them and / or with ethylene, the mixture containing or less 85 moles percent of one of the alpha-olefins, by means of a catalytic system of type Ziegler-Natta Formed by the combination of titanium chloride and an organic compound of aluminum, and in the presence of a stereospecific adjuvant. To obtain polymers or copolymers having a high index of isotacticity, the stereospecific adjuvant is a cyclic polyether of the type of crowns ethers, said polyether possibly containing sulfur atoms and / or nitrogen remnants, and to give a catalytic system. An excellent activity said adjuvant can be used in combination with an activator selected from acyclic or cyclic polynes and dihydrocarbylacetylenes. The adjuvant or adjuvant and activator can be used in the process as a pre-mixing composition of the latter with titanium chloride.
