<ABSTRACT>
a novel aqueous coating composition is proposed for  providing enteric coating on solid dosage forms such as tab­ lets.  the aqueous coating composition of the invention com­ prises a fine powder of an enterosoluble cellulose derivative  such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and hyd­ roxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate, which is insol­ uble in water but can be plasticized and solubilized with cer­ tain plasticizing agents, as dispersed in an aqueous dispers­ ing medium and a plasticizing agent having compatibility with  the enterosoluble cellulose derivative and dissolved in the  aqueous dispersing medium.  the particle size of the  enterosoluble cellulose derivative and the boiling point of the  plasticizing agent is the key parameters and should be finer  than 100 µm in an average particle diameter and not lower  than 100°c, respectively.  upon application of the aqueous  coating composition to the solid dosage forms, water as the  dispersing medium is first evaporated leaving the cellulose  derivative and the plasticizing agent, which latter solubilizes  the former to form a continuous coating layer on the solid  dosage forms imparting good and satisfactory enterosolubil­ ity thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
aqueous coating composition for providing enteric coatings on solid dosage forms and method for applying it to solid dosage formsthe present invention relates to an aqueous coating composition for providing enteric coatings on solid dosage forms. as is well known, certain solid dosage forms are desired to be disintegrated only when they arrive at the intestinal canals upon oral administration and they are imparted with enterosoluble property by providing socalled enteric coating on the surface. prior art enteric coating compositions are, for example, prepared by dissolving certain cellulose derivatives such as cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and the like in a suitable organic solvent to form an organic solution. these enteric coating compositions in the form of organic solutions have several dificiencies. they are undesirable because of the relatively high production cost due to the use of large volumes of organic solvents. furthermore, there can occur problems from the standpoint of safety since the use of an inflammable organic solvent can result in a risk of fire or explosion in the course of the coating process and emission of vapors of organic solvents to the atmosphere causes difficult problems of environmental pollution. in addition, any traces of the organic solvents remaining in the coating layer on the solid dosage forms are undesirable in consideration of possible toxicity of them. in order to avoid the problems caused by the use of organic solvents, therefore, already aqueous coating compositions were available. such prior art coating compositions have a wide versatility for various kinds of solid dosage forms, they, however, are difficultly to be applied to the solid dosage form. in the british patent 1,444,890, there is described a two step method for applying aqueous coatings to a solid dosage form. in each step there is used a coating liquid having a viscosity of it least 3 centipoise at the temperature of coating and the coating liquid contains disolved or dispersed therein, a water-soluble cellulose ether having a viscosit in the range of 1.5 to 20 centipoise as measured in a 2% by weight aqueous solution at 20°c and the concentration of the cellulose ether in the coating liquid in the second step has to be lower than the coating liquid in the first step. also in the japanese patent publication 53-12569 and japanese patent kokai 53-96314 there are described aqueous coating compositions which, however, are as well difficultly to be applied. in the u.s.a. patent 2,740,723 there is described a process for preparing finely divided cellulosic plastics by preparing a solvent-in-water emulsion of a substantially water-immiscible volatic solvent in which said cellulosic plastic is dissolved, which emulsion is spray dried. said process yields cellulosic plastic particles of extremely small particle size and bulk density which are solid spheroids and hollow spheroids and said particles can e.g. be used to prepare aqueous dispersions of said particles which can be used as coating compositions. mechanical grinding of the cellulosic plastic results in products which cannot be used for preparing aqueous film forming solutions. the
