<ABSTRACT>
Method for forming very small mask openings for the production of semiconductor circuit arrangements. For this purpose, on a substrate (10) to the next portions of a first insulating layer (12) are formed, so that substantially horizontal and substantially vertical surfaces are present. In addition, a second insulating layer (14) is made from relative to the first insulating layer of different material and subjected to a reactive ion etching method such that the horizontal regions of the second insulating layer (14) are removed and only very narrow regions of this layer on the vertically ge targeted surface areas of the first insulating layer (12) or the areas of the substrate (10) remain. Subsequently, a thermal oxidation of the exposed substrate regions is made and for the final exposure of the desired masks opening (s) (18) the regions of the second insulating layer (14) located there. This can be achieved smaller than those with conventional photolithographic control of minimal dimensions. Applications of this procedure are treated in bipolar and FET technology.
