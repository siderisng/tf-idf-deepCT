<ABSTRACT>
1.  a switch driving system having a driving part and a driven part, with two rocking levers (7, 8) whose turnpins (6) are in a single plane and are parallel to each other and there levers (7, 8) are joined together, at a point spaced from their turnpin (6), by at least one spring (14, 14') in each case which is able to be cocked, and with a locking unit, which has two locking levers (16, 23), placed in the plane of the rocking levers (7, 8), such locking levers locking in turn the rocking lever (8) transmitting  the energy of the closed spring (14, 23) to the switch till the other rocking lever (7) on being turned as is necessary for cocking the spring (14, 23) in relation to the firts-named rocking lever (8) has been moved into a starting position, characterized in that the one rocking lever (7) takes the form of the driving part, while the other rocking lever (8) takes the form of the driven part and in that the locking levers (16, 23) are designed sticking out into the path of turning of the driving part and are moved by the same out of their locking position into the unlocked position.
