<ABSTRACT>
a process for producing a high-strength cold-rolled steel  plate for press working having a tensile strength of 35-45  kg/mm² and a yield ratio of 0. 4-0. 6, which comprises hot-roll­ ing steel comprising 0. 005-0. 080% of c, not more than 0. 30%  of si, 1. 6-3. 5% of mn, 0. 02-0. 08% of sol.  al, 0. 005-0. 020% of n,  and balance of fe and unavoidable impurities, and, after cold-­ rolling, annealing at 660-750°c for not shorter than 30 minutes.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification title of the invention: method of producing high strength cold rolled steel sheet for press formation technical field: this invention relates to a method of producing a high strength cold rolled steel sheet having excellent press formability, comparable to the conventional cold rolled steel sheet for drawing. background art: the conventional cold rolled steel sheet for deep drawing has a tensile strenght of 38 - 33 kg/mmê and has been used as outer panels of automobile bodies after being press formed. however, with the recent trend in the auto industry to reduce the weight of automobiles in an attempt to improve mileage economy, more and more automobile bodies are using thinner outer panels. thus, car manufactures demand cold rolled steel sheets whose formability is comparable to the conventional one 'and having a tensile strength higher than the latter. the outer panels of automobile bodies assume various configurations depending on car models and their mounting locations, but since most of them undergo only a slight degree of press formation, form retention after pressing is a very important factor. the conventional high tensile steel has a high yielding point and experiences considerable spring back and as a result, it is difficult to provide a press formed article with a desired configuration. in addition, since the steel permits only too small elongation, it can easily develop cracks during press forming. the dual phase steel of recent development has low yielding point, but since its tensile strength is 50 70 kg/mm2, it undergoes too rapid work hardening and provides high yielding point after slight press forming, making it difficult to produce a desired configuration free from the effect of spring back. disclosure of the invention: the. inventors of this invention have found, after carrying out intensive¯study to solve these problems, that a cold rolled steel sheet having a tensile strength of 35 - 45 kg/mm2, a yield ratio (yield strength/tensile strength)--of 0.4 - 0.6, an r-value of more than 1.2 is most suitable for providing the desired steel sheet for use as outer panels of an automobile body. the primary purpose of this invention is to provide a method of producing a cold rolled steel sheet having the above defined characteristics. in general, the higher the strength of steel, the less the press formability and form retention. however, according to this invention, a cold rolled steel sheet can be provided which has press formability and form retention comparable to the conventional cold rolled steel sheet and yet has high strength and dent resistance higher than the conventional one, thus making great contribution to making of lighter cars. the term "dent resistance" means the property of a cold rolled steel sheet that does not retain a depression (permanent deformation) resulting from an external force applied to a press formed article made of that sheet. this invention resides in a method of producing a high strength cold rolled steel sheet for press formation which is characterized by hot rolling a steel consisting of 0.005 0.080%
