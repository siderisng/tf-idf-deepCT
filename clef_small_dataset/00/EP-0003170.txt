<ABSTRACT>
in an apparatus for measuring the gravimetric fuel  consumption of a liquid fuel burning engine, in order to  avoid having to weigh a vessel from which fuel is withdrawn  as it is consumed, a body (18) of higher density than the fuel  is suspended from a weighing device (20) in a vessel (10) so  as to be partly immersed in the fuel, the cross-sectional areas  of the vessel (10) and the body (18) in horizontal planes  bearing a precise and known relationship to one another, so  that the weighing device (20) measures the weight of fuel  withdrawn from the vessel (10) in terms of the gain in the  apparent weight of the body (18) which results from the  reduction in its immersed volume.  preferably the weighing  device (20) is of the electronic type, permitting little or no  downward movement of the body (18) to take place, and  providing a digital read-out.  further means may be provided  to measure the time of operation, the number of revolutions  of the engine, and the average dynamometer torque exerted  during a test.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for measuring fuel consumption of a liquid-fuel burning engine this invention relates to apparatus for measuring the fuel consumption of a liquid-fuel burning engine. in our british patent specification no.1,411,171, we have described and claimed an apparatus for measuring the fuel consumption of such an engine in volumetric terms, com- prising a measuring vessel for containing a measured volume of fuel and photoelectric devices for sensing predetermined levels of the fuel as it is withdrawn from the vessel and consumed by the engine. there is, however, a demand for measurement of fuel consumption in gravimetric terms. various kinds of apparatus for measuring gravimetric fuel consumption are available, but they generally involve the weighing of a vessel from which fuel is withdrawn as it is consumed, and this arrangement is found to have a number of disadvantages0 according to the present invention, an apparatus for measuring the gravimetric fuel consumption of a liquid-fuel burning engine comprises a vessel which is connectable with a source of liquid fuel for delivery of a predetermined volume of fuel to the vessel and which is also connectable at its bottom with the fuel intake of an engine, wherein a body of higher density than the fuel is suspended in the vessel so as to be partially but not wholly immersed when the predetermined volume of fuel is present in the vessel, and the cross-sectional areas of the vessel and body in corresponding horizontal planes throughout the operative vertical range of fuel levels in the vessel bear a precise and known relationship to one another, the body being suspended from a weighing device which measures the weight of fuel withdrawn from the vessel on consumption by the engine in terms of the gain jn the apparent weight of the body which arises from the reduction in its immersed volume. the apparatus thus makes use of archimedes' principle, that the loss of weight of a body immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the body. as fuel is withdrawn from the vessel, the immersed volume of the body is reduced in proportion to the volume of fuel withdrawn, this proportion being known from the relative crosssectional areas of the vessel and body. the apparent weight of the body thus increases in proportion to the weight of fuel withdrawn from the vessel. in a typical embodiment, both the vessel and body are cylindrical and the horizontal cross-sectional area of the vessel is exactly twice that of the suspended body, in which case the increase in apparent weight of the body will equal the weight of fuel withdrawn from the vessel, subject to any correction for movement of the body as described below0 if the cross-sectional area of the vessel were, for example, three times that of the body, the weight of fuel withdrawn from the vessel would equal twice the gain in the apparent weight of the body. preferably the body is suspended from the weighing device in such a
