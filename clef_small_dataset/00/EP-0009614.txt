<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides an improved brewing  process which utilizes an adjunct comprising a highly fer­ mentable sugar.  in the process, brewers' yeast is allowed to  act upon a, preferably all-malt, wort until said yeast is partially  developed, following which, the said adjunct is introduced  into the partially fermented wort and the brewing process  carried to completion.  it is preferable that the said adjunct is  introduced into the partially fermented wort over a period of  time during which the plato value of the wort is not drastically  altered.  the process is capable of achieving high degrees of  attenuation without the addition of additional discrete  enzymes and is especially advantageous when used to pro­ duce alcoholic brewery beverages having reduced caloric  and/or alcoholic contents.

<DESCRIPTION>
brewing process and the obtained alcoholic product the present invention relates to a brewing process, and in particular, a brewing process which is adapted to produce a variety of beers having different characteristics. in a standard brewing process a fermentation substrate, "wort", is prepared from barley malt, and, in most instances, from additional carbohydrate adjunct material. the spectrum of saccharine materials in the wort depends on the characteristics of the malt that is used,the mashing conditions and the type and amount of adjunct material that is used. the adjunct material may be any appropriate form of starch or sl.gar. though maltose represents the largest percentage of the fermentable sugars derived from brewers malt under standard mashing conditions invariably there are present in the wort additional fermentable sugars that are preferentially metabolized by the yeast. these sugars are sucrose, fructose and glucose and are hereinafter referred to as "highly fermentable sugars". however, the metabolism of these highly fermentable sugars, when present in a wort in abnormally high concentrations with respect to maltose, compared to the relative amounts of such substances in a standard wort, contribute significantly to the organoleptic properties, and hence basic character, of the resultant beer. also contributing 0 said organoleptic properties are the products obtained from the wort nitrogenous material originating from the malt. further contributors to the organoleptic properties of the beer product are the yeast which effects the desired fermentation and the hops which are introduced into the wort during boiling thereof in the kettle. if the amount of highly fermentable sugar, and in particular, glucose, in the wort when fermentation commences is increased significantly, say to over 10-12%, then the fermentation response of the yeast changes significantly. as noted above, the yeast preferentially metabolizes the highly fermentable sugars, especially glucose, and if the amount thereof is increased as described above, the yeast will utilize essentially the glucose during its rapid growth phase and for a period thereafter. as a consequence, the yeast does not adequately develop its capability to metabolize the more complex fermentable sugars such as maltotriose and as a result, is unable to do so efficiently in the latter part of the fermentation. complete generation of the components which provide the beer product with its fundamental characteristics is not achieved. in addition, such systems are proven to result in hanging fermentations. it should also be noted that the non-fermentables, such as the dextrins and the alcohol content are largely responsible for the caloric content of the desired beer product. the present trend in north america is toward beers which, inter alia, have a caloric value lower than conventional beers, usually by a third or more. as noted above, the caloric value of a beer depends primarily on the alcohol content and residual carbohydrate content. the light beers usually have a reduced alcohol content, about 20% generally, but this is not sufficient to give the desired reduction in caloric value. it is, therefore, necessary to reduce the amount of non-fermentable sugars which emanate from

<CLAIMS>
what we claim is:   1. in a brewing process wherein a malt wort is prepared; supplemented with a sugar adjunct, fermented with brewers' yeast; and,following completion of the fermentation, finished to the desired alcoholic brewery beverage; the improvement comprising initially fermenting a malt wort with brewers' yeast until said yeast is partially developed to at   leastaabout    one-half of the maximum amount of development obtainable during the fermentation, thereby providing a partially fermented wort, thereafter introducing an adjunct comprising a highly fermentable   sugar    into the partially fermented wort, and then continuing the fermentation.   2. the process according to claim 1 wherein said yeast is initially partially developed to at least about two-thirds of the maximum amount of development obtainable during the fermentation.   3. the process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the said adjunct is infused into the partially fermented malt wort over a period of time.   4. the process according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the wort is an all-malt wort.   5. the process according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the said adjunct is introduced into the partially   ferment    ed malt wort from 18 to 54 hours after the fermentation of the wort has commenced.   6. the process according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the said adjunct is introduced into the partially fermented malt wort from 18 to 36 hours after the fermentation of the wort has commenced.   7. the process according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein  the adjunct is introduced into the   partial    fermented   mak    wort from 44 to 54 hours after the fermentation of the wort has commenced.   8. the process according to any of claims 1 to 7 wherein the adjunct is solely a highly fermentable sugar.   9. the process according to claim 8 wherein the adjunct is solely sucrose.   10. the process according to any of claims 1 to 9 wherein the malt comprises brewers' malt and one or both of distillers' malt and caramel malt.   11. the process according to any of claims 3 to 10 wherein the highly fermentable sugar is introduced into the fermenting wort over a period of from 12 to 48 hours.   12. the process according to any of the preceeding claims wherein the degree of attenuation is 80% or more.   13. the process according to any of the preceeding claims wherein highly fermentable sugar is introduced into the fermenting wort in the form of an aqueous solution.   14. the process according to claim 13 wherein the said sugar solution comprises from 10% to 65% by weight of highly fermentable sugar.   15. the process according to claim 13 wherein the said sugar solution comprises at least 15% by weight of highly fermentable sugar.   16. in a brewing process wherein a malt wort   i6    prepared; supplemented with a sugar adjunct, fermented with   brewers'    yeast; and, following completion of the fermentation,finished to the desired alcoholic brewery beverage; the improvement comprising initially fermenting a malt wort  with brewers' yeast until said yeast is partially developed to at least about two thirds of the maximum amount of development obtainable during the fermentation,thereby providing a partially fermented wort, thereafter infusing an adjunct comprising a highly fermentable sugar into the partially fermented wort, and then continuing the fermentation until a degree of attenuation of 80% or more is achieved.    17. the process according to claim 16 wherein the adjunct is solely a highly fermentable sugar and is introduced into the fermenting wort in the form of an aqueous solution comprising from about 10% to about 65% sugar.   18. the process according to claim 16 or 17 wherein the adjunct is solely sucrose.   19. the process according to any of claims 16 to 18 wherein said adjunct is infused into the partially fermented wort over a period of from 12 to 48 hours, infusion commencing from 18 to 54 hours after the fermentation of the malt wort has commenced.   20. the process according to any of claims 16 to 19 wherein the malt comprises brewers' malt and one or both of distillers' malt and caramel malt.   21. an alcoholic brewery product whenever produced by a process as claimed in any preceeding claim 1 to 20.
