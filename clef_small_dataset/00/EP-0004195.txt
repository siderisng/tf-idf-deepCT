<ABSTRACT>
the present invention is directed to water-in-oil type fuel  oil emulsions which are particularly useful in firing boilers in  ships, locomotives and industrial power plants.  furthermore,  the invention is directed to aqueous particulate slurries dispersed  in fuel oil.  specifically, the invention is directed to  aqueous/oil slurries of combustible or non combustible particulate  having improved burning characteristics.  of specific  interest are aqueous/oil slurries of coal dust.  these emulsions  and slurries are achieved through the use of blend of  cationic, nonionic and/or anionic surfactant compounds to  which the invention is also directed.
