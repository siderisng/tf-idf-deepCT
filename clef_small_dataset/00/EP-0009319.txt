<ABSTRACT>
higher plant cells (e.  g.  cells of spermatophyta) cap­ able of growing in the presence of light and in the ab­ sence of a carbohydrate carbon source are produced  from higher plant cells which require a carbohydrate  source by cultivation in an aqueous medium in the pre­ sence of light, o₂ and co₂.  the quantity of carbohydrate  is reduced during the cultivation whilst the concentration  of dissolved oxygen is maintained at a value below 250 n  mol of o₂ per ml of medium.  preferably cultivation is in continous culture and the  preferred dissolved o₂ concentration is from 25 to 85 n  mol per ml.  the co₂ present and the quantum flux density  may be increased as the carbohydrate is reduced.
