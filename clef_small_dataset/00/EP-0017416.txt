<ABSTRACT>
a uniform asphalt pavement structure of substantial  area composed of aggregates of varying natural qualities  produced by a controlled process including mix design, mix  analysis, and plant control methods.  the method uses a  riguez index which is characteristic of the fine aggregate  portion of the job mix formula, and flexiblity/stablity  function derived from different combinations of crushed fine  and blend sand.  the riguez index is compared with volumetÂ­ ric representations of blended mixtures thereby to provide  means for detecting voidage variations in the mixture  resulting from natural changes in aggregate quality and to  control a mixing plant for continuously producing uniform  pavements the job control method uses gradation over a  single sieve size, asphalt quantity, and or quantity mineral  filler as job control parameters at the mixing plant to control  voidage.
