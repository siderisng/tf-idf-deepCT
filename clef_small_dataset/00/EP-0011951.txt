<ABSTRACT>
a novel composition of crude tamarind kernel  powder (tkp) is disclosed.  the novel composition  results from a process which makes tkp soluble in cold  water; this process is not dependent on purification of  tkp, but involves dissolving it in hot water and eva­ porating the resulting solution.  the novel tkp compo­ sition has utility in textile, paper, and oilfield applica­ tions.

<DESCRIPTION>
cold-water soluble tamarind gum this invention relates to tamarind kernel powder (tkp). tkp is defined herein as tamarind kernel powder obtained from the seed kernels of the tree, tamarindus indica (linn), resulting from husking and milling of these seed kernels. tkp includes all of the constituents found in the tamarind seed kernel: polysaccharide (composed of uronic acid and the neutral sugars arabinoss, xylose, mannose, glucose, and galactose), protein, and any other cellular debris from the tamarind kernel seed. this tkp is crude and soluble in cold water (in the rare of 5-350c). tkp is dispersed in water and a solution obtained by boiling in most tkp applications where a purified product is not necessary such as in warp sizing, latex rubber, adhesives, and in the paper - and plywood industries. there exist in the art several purification methods for making a cold-water soluble product from tkp. u.s. 3,287,350 teaches the art of purifying tkp to obtain tamarind seed jellose (tsj), the polysaccharide constituent of tkp. the process specifies bleaching of the coarsely ground tamarind seed kernels which are then dispersed in a 25-fold amount of water. after injection of steam, the solution is filtered and the tsj precipitated by using a sulfate and alcohol. u.s. 3,3-99,189 teaches the art of making a cold-water soluble product from tkp by extracting the polysaccharide from tamarind seed kernels with isopropanol at n800c, the polysaccharide then being dispersed in a 25to 35-fold amount of water. injection of steam and subsequent filtration yield a cold-watersoluble product which is recovered from solution by roll drying or precipitation with an organic solvent. sutt'ary of te.e invention a process has now been found for producing a novel composition from unpurified tamarind kernel powder which is soluble in cold water. this novel product can be used for the same purposes as tkp. detailed description of the invention the prior art processes for preparing a cold-water-soluble tamarind product are based on separation (via precipitation and/or filtration) of the polysaccharide from the other constituents contained in txp. the present invention teaches the art of preparing coldwater soluble tamarind gum (cwstg) by a method which does not require purification. this product is similar in appearance and physical properties to tkp; however, its cold-water solubility is unexpected in view of the previously described tkp cold-water solubilization methods from which it may be inferred that the constituents of tkp other than the polysaccharide contribute to tkp's cold-water insolubility and must be removed in order to obtain a cold-water soluble tamarind product. the present invention, via its cold-water- solubilization process, produces a dry, crude tkp product containing all of the txp constituents and exhibiting cold-water solubility. it is- understood by those in the art that tkp is a commercially available crude product which has trace impurities which vary from shipment to shipment. these impurities comprise metal -shavings, wood pulp,-cellulose from tamarind seed husks, and other plant parts and inorganic impurities. many of these impurities are inherently insoluble in water and are excluded from the scope
