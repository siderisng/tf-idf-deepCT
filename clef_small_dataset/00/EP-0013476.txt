<ABSTRACT>
this disclosure is concerned with passing the leading  edge of successive sheets carried by a high-speed conveyor  over a slowdown region, and when the rear edge portion of  the sheet reaches said region, grabbing the same to slow  down the sheet to the desired speed and then releasing it and  permitting the leading edge of the next sheet to travel freely at  high speed over said region, thereby to enable controlled  slow-down of the high-speed for predetermined overlap on  lower speed conveyors or stacking on platforms.
