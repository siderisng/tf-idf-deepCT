<ABSTRACT>
in a push-push switch a contact carrier (24) is provided  which carries a contact member (32) movable to and from a  position in which it touches two terminals (9).  the contact  carrier (24) is provided with a central ribbed (26) boss (25)  movable in a channel defined by co-operating axially extending  ribs (18), the lowermost surface of the boss being serrated  (27) to cause rotation of a rotatable member (21) having arms  (22) which engage the serrations (27) on movement thereof by  the push-button.  the arms (22), in one position can pass freely  past the ribs (18), and in another position engage a stop  surface (20) on the ribs (18), thus retaining the contact carrier  (24) in a lower position in which the switch is closed.  a first  spring (13) biasses the rotatable member (21) upwardly and a  second spring (39) biasses the contact carrier (24) downwardly.
