<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a strap wrench having a flexible  work-engaging element (11) pivoted to a handle (21)  by a pair of links (14) to permit passage of the free end of  the flexible element between the links, whereby the element  may be wrapped in full circumscribing relation to a workpiece  (37).  the handle has a camming surface (25) positioned  to confront the exposed surface of the strap when  it is wrapped around the workpiece and to engage the  same and without moving parts to anchor the strap at that  point when said handle is actuated to apply torque to the  workpiece.  the strap has a friction surface on the side  confronting the workpiece and has a slip surface on the  exposed side with lesser friction to permit the strap to slide  over said camming surface prior to applying torquing action  upon said handle to afford snug engagement of the  strap with the workpiece.  preferably, the handle is formed  of a one-piece rigid plastics composition having a specific  gravity which permits the wrench to float in water.
