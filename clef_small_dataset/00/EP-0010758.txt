<ABSTRACT>
a pressure-sensitive adhesive comprises the reaction  product of (a) at least one alkyl acrylate liquid polymer  containing both terminal and random hydroxyl functionali­ ty, as well as sulfide and optionally also disulfide linkages  near the terminal portions of the polymer molecule; (b) at  least one prepolymer of a polyester glycol or a polyalkylene  ether glycol with an excess amount of an aromatic diiso­ cyanate; and (c) at least one alkanediol containing from 3 to  10 carbon atoms.  use of the alkanediol improves 180° peel  strength and maintains u. v.  stability of the adhesive.
