<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain a larger adjustment range of a variable feed force of the working cylinder when friction welding, the invention provides that the effective piston surface of the working cylinder of a friction welding device is increased.This change is realized by the fact that viewed from the pressure side of the working cylinder (1), in this an additional cylinder (3) is used, preferably screwed, which is also movable in a praising direction.As a result, additive is used by the working cylinder (1) and additional cylinder (3) individually achievable pressure values.For this purpose, a so-called pressure piece (5) is screwed onto the work piston (4) of the additional cylinder (3) which carries via a support (6) which carries the friction and compression pressure required for friction welding friction and compression pressure on a workpiece.
