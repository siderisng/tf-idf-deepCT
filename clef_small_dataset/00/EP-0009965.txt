<ABSTRACT>
a gas laser for generating multiline emissions when  appropriately energized.  the laser includes an anode-cathode  assembly (18, 16, 18) and, in a first embodiment, adjustable  brewster end sections or in a second embodiment, integral  mirror end sections (70, 72).  the anode-cathode assembly  comprises one center located short cylindrical anode (16) and  two segmented cylindrical hollow cathodes (18) located  symmetrically on each side of the anode (16), the inner diameÂ­ ter of the hollow cathodes being selected for a particular laser  transition.  the anode (16) and cathodes (18) are electrically  insulated by cylindrical metal-ceramic seals (20).  the outer  surface of each cathode (18) is covered with quartz insulating  sleeves (24) to prevent electrical discharge from the outer  cathode surface and to encourage effective inner cathode  discharge.  the cathode (18) is thermally connected to the  external environment through a structure (26) coupled to the  laser tube envelope (11) to improve heat dissipation, thereby  allowing higher input power.  a metal vapor reservoir (30)  attached to the anode section for metal vapor laser operation.   the laser of the present invention can be made up of one or  more anode-cathode assemblies depending on the laser  medium and the selected output requirement.

<DESCRIPTION>
gas laser this invention relates to a gas laser of the kind which includes an elongate envelope containing a gaseous medium, hollow coaxial anode and cathode means for connection to a voltage supply to produce an electrical discharge in the gaseous medium, and reflector means at or near the ends of the envelope. the present state of laser technology has advanced substantially from that available in prior years. for example, a variety of laser devices, including gas lasers, dye lasers and solid state lasers are available for particular customer applications. at this time, a substantial portion of the commercially marketed lasers are of the gas variety. the gas lasers available are generally limited to a laser device which produces on a single wavelength (emission line) or a single color output. for example, helium-neon laser devices which 0 are available commercially generate only the red wavelength (i.e., 6328a) output. although argon ion gas lasers are available which are capable of simultaneously producing blue and green output light, the argon gas laser is considered to be too costly, inefficient and cumberser e as far as size is concerned to have extensive commercial applications. the laser disclosed in u.s. patent no. 4,021,845 produces white light (light having multiple lines) which includes three of the primary colors; red, blue and green. the laser is very advantageous since an end user has the capability of selecting the desired wavelength(s) for a particular application from a plurality of available wavelengths, the laser being relatively inexpensive and of a physical size which makes it attractive for many commercial applications. although the laser described in the aforementioned patent has performed satisfactorily, a more compact and controllable type of laser which can be operated at higher input density would be desirable. further, it would be desirable if the basic configuration of the laser could be easily expandable to allow the power level for a selected wavelength to be increased depending on the type of application required. in other words, what is desired is a multiline laser device which is capable of operating at high input power density which in turn allows the power level for a particular wavelength desired to be increased, has improved stability characteristics, is compact and is cost effective while providing the multiple line output. the gas laser of the present invention is intended to provide these additional advantages, and is characterized in that the cathode means comprises at least two separate cathodes. in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the inside diameters of at least two of the cathodes are different. the hollow-cathode gas laser of the present invention provides many advantages over prior art multi-line lasers in that the gain, current density and power loading of each laser transition can be controlled and wherein, for multicolor operation, color balancing and control is also provided. a gas laser in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a side view
