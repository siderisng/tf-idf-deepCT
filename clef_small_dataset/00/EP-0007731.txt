<ABSTRACT>
aqueous dispersions of particles of non-polymeric hydrophobic solids are stabilised against flocculation by means of a block or graft copolymer containing in the molecule a component which is solvated by the aqueous medium and another component of a specified degree of hydrophobicity which is associated with the solid particles.  a limited degree of controlled and reversible flocculation of the particles can be introduced by the additional presence of a polymer which is soluble in the aqueous medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
particulate dispersions this invention relates to dispersions of solid, non-polymeric hydrophobic particles in aqueous media, the particles bearing on their surface adsorbed polymer chains, and to the manufacture of such dispersions. it is already known to produce dispersions of solid, non-polymeric hydrophobic particles in aqueous media with the aid of conventional dispersing agents such as sulphonated naphthalene-formaldehyde condensates, lignosulphonates, partially hydrolysed poly(vinyl acetate) or poly(ethylene oxide) - poly(propylene oxide) block copolymers. in certain practical situations, however, for example in the application as seed dressings of dispersions containing biologically active solid particles, it is desirable to attain high volume concentrations of the disperse phase and it is found that, when using these conventional dispersing agents, the products usually have markedly non-newtonian flow properties or, in some cases, are even gel-like. such characteristics pose difficulties both for the manufacture of the dispersions, e.g. by milling processes, and for their subsequent use; they can be attributed to the existence of substantial flocculation of the disperse particles, which in turn is probably due to relatively weak attachment of the dispersing agent molecule to the particle surface. the present invention is based on the.discovery that, by employing as dispersing agents a certain class of amphipathic copolymer, it is possible to produce dispersions in aqueous media of hydrophobic, non-polymeric solid particles which have higher disperse phase volume concentrations than have hitherto been attainable and which yet possess a high degree of fluidity; alternatively, it is possible thereby to prepare fluid dispersions having the presently attainable levels of disperse phase volume concentration with a significant reduction in the weight ratio of dispersing agent to disperse phase which is required. in british patent specification no. 1,211,344 there are described, inter alia, dispersions in aqueous media of non-polymeric solid particles in which the dispersing agents used are amphipathic graft copolymers. these graft copolymers happen to belong to the class of amphipathic copolymer defined according to the present invention, but they are shown in the document in question only as being used in conjunction with hydrophilic solid particles. the dispersions thus obtained do not possess the advantages afforded by the present invention. thus according to the present invention there is provided a dispersion in an aqueous medium of a nonpolymeric hydrophobic particulate solid substantially all the particles of which have a size less than 100 microns, the dispersion containing a block or graft copolymer the molecule of which comprises at least one component (a), of molecular weight at least 250, which is solvated by the aqueous medium and at least one other component (b), of molecular weight at least 500 and having a minimum degree of hydrophobicity as hereinafter defined, which is associated with the particulate solid, the total weight ratio of components a to components b in the copolymer being from 1:10 to 10:1 and the ratio of the number of individual components a to individual components b in the copolymer molecule being from 10:1 to 1:2. according to another aspect of the invention there is provided a process
