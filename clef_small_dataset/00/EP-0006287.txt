<ABSTRACT>
a d. c.  triggered master-slave flip-flop circuit includes  a master flip-flop (103) with a capacitive delay means (c2)  at its input, and a slave flip-flop (104) having its input con­ nected to the output of the master flip-flop.  a capacitive  delay means (c3) is connected at the input of the slave  flip-flop.  the slave flip-flop controls the connections at the  input of the master flip-flop in known manner.  the two  capacitive delay means (c2, c3), serve to make each flip-­ flop circuit immune to noise pulses and also eliminate mul­ tiple triggering caused by contact bounce when the circuit  is controlled by mechanical contacts.
