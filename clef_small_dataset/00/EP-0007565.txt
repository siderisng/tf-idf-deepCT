<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a special method for producing a titanium component for polymerization catalysts of the Ziegler-Natta type. Characteristic of the inventive method is that one is first (1) in a first stage (1. 1) an alcoholate of the formula Mg (OR) ₂ wherein R stands for a lower alkyl group, and (1. 2) benzoyl chloride, in one certain mole ratio in a spherical fluid mill under certain grinding ringunes, in particular a relatively low temperature in the absence of diluents with one in addition; then (2) in a second stage (2. 1) of the substance resulting from step (1) with (2. 2) titanium tetrachloride in a certain amount ratio, the whole under constant mixing holds some time to increase temperature and the resulting Solidly isolated under separation excess titanium tetrachloride; and finally (3) in a third stage (3. 1), the solid resulting from step (2) brings together again with (3. 2) titanium tetrachloride in a certain amount of permanent ratio, the whole under constant mixing again holds some time on increased temperature and the The resulting solid - as the new titanium component-under separation is isolated excess titanium tetrachloride. The new titanium component makes it possible to produce polymers of α-monoolefins not only in high yield, but also with high isotak ticinity.
