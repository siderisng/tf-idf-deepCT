<ABSTRACT>
the specification discloses an electronic or computer-­ based railway control signal interlocking system.  signals  representing the settings or conditions of railway control  elements e. g.  track circuits, signals and points, and their  control signals are checked as usual by the interlock equip­ ment to establish route safety.  however failures in the  system may only be discovered when a change to a control  element setting is attempted.  since long periods can elapse  between changes a failure may lie dormant for some time.   in order to reduce dormant wrong side failure periods to a  minimum the signals supplied to the interlocking means  are periodically smitched to a predetermined state chosen  to prove that when the interlocking means receives the  switched signal that a wrong side failure mode does not  exist in the switched signal path.
