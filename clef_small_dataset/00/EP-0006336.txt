<ABSTRACT>
a nongelled hydroxy ester copolymer composition  substantially free of oxirane functionality comprising an  acidic copolymer-epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction pro­ duct, the epoxy resin being a mixture containing at least  5% by weight of aromatic polyether which is difunctional  in oxirane functionality which is consumed by reaction  with the acidic copolymer and the acidic copolymer being  a solution copoiymer of monoethylenically unsaturated  monomers comprising at least about 20% of monoethyl­ enically unsaturated carboxylic acid, based on the total  weight of monomers, the epoxy resin mixture constituting  at least about 40% of the total resin solids content and  providing oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric defi­ ciency with respect to carboxyl functionality in the acidic  copoymer of from 1:2 to 1:20, at least a portion of the  carboxyl functionality in the copolymer-epoxy resin hydroxy  ester reaction product being reacted with a base to render  the reaction product self-emulsifiable in water.
