<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a fly ash utilization  process or system for the removal of sulfur dioxide from the  flue gas of coal fired boilers.  in one embodiment, a high ionic concentration is  maintained in a closed loop, water balanced system which is  operated at a low ph, i. e.  less than 4 and preferably less than  3.  the ionic concentration of the scrubber slurry is main­ tained at at least 5,000 parts per million of alkali metal  cations, preferably over 10,000 parts per million, at least a  substantial portion of which has been leached from fly ash.  the ionic concentration of the scrubber slurry is main­ tained at a high level by providing small diked areas (38, 42)  in a waste pond (34) for settling of undissolved solids  wherein the returned supernatant has a high ionic concentra­ tion.  a principal advantage of the system is that there is a  substantially reduced liquid-to-gas ratio required for scrub­ bing so₂, with substantial savings in pumping and power  requirements for the system.
