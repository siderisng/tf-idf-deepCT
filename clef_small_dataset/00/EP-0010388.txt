<ABSTRACT>
a connector for a pair of optical fibers includes a first lens  means (11) adapted to be coupled to one of the optical fibers  and a second lens means (12) adapted to be coupled to the  other one of the optical fibers.  the first and second lens  means (11, 12) are axially aligned and spaced with respect to  each other for directing light rays (40) paraxially therebet­ ween to eliminate the light loss effect due to optical fiber  (13,14) spacing and for focusing the light provided by one  optical fiber onto the other optical fiber.  the lens means also  include lens members (17,18) that minimize spherical aberra­ tion to provide efficient light transfer between the pair of  optical fibers (13,14).

<DESCRIPTION>
optical fiber coupling system background of the invention the present invention is directed to an improved connector =sembl-y which provides increased light transfer efficiency in between optical fibers. fiber optic cables generally comprise a core of light transmissive material covered by an external protective sheath or cladding. the core may take the form of one or more glass fibers wherein each fiber is extremely small in diameter, on the order of 100 microns. the cladding is usually formed from a material having a lower index of refraction than the glass core fiber or fibers to assure propagation of the light introduced into the core down the cable by internal reflections. the indices of the cladding and core are customarily chosen so that the light will propagate along the cable with a maximum angle of internal reflection of about 7.80 from the center axis of the fiber. in use, for conveying infqrmation, at one end of the fiber optic cable is a light source in the form of, for example, a laser or a light emitting diode. the light output of the light source is modulated by an electrical signal having a waveform representing the information to be conveyed. the modulated light enters the one end of the cable and is propagated down the cable within the core by internal reflection. at the other end of the cable is a light sensitive detector and associated electronic circuitry which detects the changes in intensity of the conveyed modulated light and transforms the same back into an electrical signal which is a reproduction of the modulating waveform. in practical information communication applications, optical fibers must be connected to and disconnected from other optical fibers or signal processing equipment. optical fiber connector assemblies are therefore required to provide such interconnections. however, in the coupling of optical fibers by such connectors, the light transfer efficiency may be adversely effected by u number of factors. among these factors the major contributors to degraded light transfer efficiency are: (1) axial misalignment of the fibers; (2) angular misalignment of the fibers; (3) scattering of light by extraneous particles between the fiber terminal ends; (4) light leakage or escape due to fiber terminal and spacing or the lack of internal reflection in the interconnection region; and (5) internal reflection due to changes in the refraction indices between the fibers and the medium in the space therebetween. with respect to the losses resulting from axial and angular misalignment of the fibers, various forms of connectors, well known in the art, have been proposed which accurately align the fibers both axially and angularly. with respect to the other above-mentioned factors, the degree to which these factors have been overcome have depended in large measure-en the type of optical fiber encountered. optical fibers are mainly of two different types, the stepped index type and the graded index type. the stepped index type of fiber has a uniform index of refraction throughout for each radial displacement from the fiber center axis. hence, there
