<ABSTRACT>
a liquid absorbing laminated structure (l) which may be  used as dressing material or in baby linen, comprises a  water-permeable facing sheet and a backing sheet having a  liquid absorbing material distributed between the sheets.  the  facing sheet and backing sheet are joined together only at  spaced points, lines or areas.  the liquid absorbing material  may be a hydrocolloidal polymer and may have the property  of acting as an adhesive when moistened with water.  the  spaced points, lines or areas may be provided by the raised  portions (p) of an embossed pattern applied to the sheets.  the  invention includes processes for the preparation of such  liquid absorbing laminates.
