<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for the manufacture of objects  from thermoplastic structural foam.  in order to reduce the retention time required for cool­ ing of a foamed injection-moulded object inside the mould,  the latter is provided with means to produce a locally in­ creased cooling effect in the mould.  such means are, for  instance, cooling fingers (10).  the purpose of these cooling  fingers is the rapid formation of bridges which consist of  solidified material (12) and connect two opposite solidified  walls (11 and 11a) of the object.  these bridges permit of  removing the object from the mould earlier, because the  object is sooner capable of resisting the internal pressure  of the foaming agent.  the method and the invention are mainly meant for  the manufacture of thick flat or curved plate-shaped objects,  such as walls and furniture.  materials which can be used  are, for instance polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene,  polycarbonate, polyamides and thermoplastic polyesters,  as well as copolymers and mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for the manufacture of objects from thermoplastic structural foam the invention relates to a method and apparatus for the manufacture of objects from thermoplastic structural foambyinjection of a foamable thermoplastic synthetic substance into a cooled mould. objects consisting of thermoplastic structural foam have a foamed core and a compact skin, with a gradual transition in material density from the core towards the surface. the injection moulding of objects from structural foam according to a known method is as follows. after addition of a blowing agent, the thermoplastic material is plasticized in an extruder and homogenized, after which it is rapidly injected into a mould by means of an injection cylinder and plunger. up to the moment of entering the mould, the material is kept under a pressure which is higher than the foaming pressure of the blowing agent at the operating temperature in order to prevent premature foaming. the volume of the unfoamed material injected is normally smaller than the volume of the mould. as the pressure in the mould is lower than the foaming pressure of the blowing agent, the material injected will expand so that the mould is filled up completely. a large part of the volatile blowing agent escapes from the material which is at the boundary surface during the filling. the material practically free of blowing agent is then pushed against the cooled wall of the mould, where its temperature declines so far that plasticity is lost and a compact skin is formed. the object can be removed from the mould as soon as it has cooled to the point where the skin can resist the internal pressure of the blowing agent, and the heat in the core can no longer soften the skin. the cooling time of the mould takes up a relatively large part of the total time required for an injection-moulding cycle. the drawbacks of this are that the injection-moulding machine cannot be utilized optimally and that the material must be retained in the injection-moulding machine for a long time.these long retention times at the usual high operating temperatures are harmful to the heat-sensitive material and impair the quality of the objects to be produced. to obviate these drawbacks, a system with several moulds to each injection-moulding machine is sometimes used. this system is expensive owing to the costs of purchase and maintenance of the moulds and the appurtenant device for transport of the moulds. another system to obviate the drawbacks mentioned involves a method of cooling which is partially effected outside the mould. with this method, the object is removed from the mould when the skin of the object is already capable of resisting the internal pressure of the blowing agent, but the heat in the core is still high enough to soften the skin of the object. to prevent softening of the skin and the resultant deformation, the object is immersed in a cooling bath immediately upon removal from the mould. this cooling bath takes over the cooling

 claims   1. method for the manufacture of objects from thermoplastic structural  foam by injection of a foamable thermoplastic synthetic substance  into a cooled mould, this method being characterized in that the  cooling is controlled in such a manner that, prior to complete  solidification of the core material, in one or more places bridges  are formed which consist of solidified material and connect two  opposite solidified skin areas of the object, and in that the  object is removed from the mould at the moment that the bridges,  together with the solidified skin, are capable of resisting the  internal pressure of the blowing agent.   2. method according to claim 1, characterized in that the moment at  which the object is removed from the mould is determined by means  of a pressure measurement.   3. method according to claim 1, characterized in that the object is  subjected to continued cooling in a cooling bath immediately after  release from the mould.   4. apparatus for carrying out the method according to claim 1,  consisting of an injection-moulding machine and a mould provided  with cooling channels, characterized in that the mould design  incorporates means for producing a locally increased cooling  effect.   5. apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the means  for producing a locally increased cooling effect consist of  cooling fingers on at least one of two opposite mould walls,  which cooling fingers are not in contact with other parts of the  mould when this is in closed position.      6. apparatus according to claims 4 and 5, characterized in that,  with the mould in closed position, each cooling finger on the one  mould wall is in line with a cooling finger on the opposite wall.   7. apparatus according to claims 4 and 5, characterized in that,  with the mould in closed position, the cooling fingers of two  opposite moulds pass along each other.   8. apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the locally  increased cooling effect is obtained by locally increasing the  number of cooling channels.   9. apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the locally  increased cooling effect is obtained by incorporating channels  which can be connected to a source supplying a cooling medium with  a temperature lower than that in the other channels.   10. object manufactured by means of the method according to claims  1, 2 and 3.
