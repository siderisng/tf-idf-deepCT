<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector (10) for terminating flat elec足 trical cable (18) of the type having at least one ground  conductor (20) between adjacent signal conductors (22),  all the conductors being secured in fixed, parallel, closely  spaced relationship within an insulating web, includes a  cover member (12) having a cable-engaging face defined  by a plurality of conductor-receiving passages (30, 32),  alternate ones (30) of the passages (30, 32) being adapted  to receive the signal conductors (22) and the ground con足 ductors (20) respectively, with the ground-conductor pas足 sages (30) having greater depth than the signal-conductor  passages (32), whereby conductors (20, 22) seated in the  passages (30, 32) can be terminated by applying a housing  (14) to the cover member (12) with terminals (56) and a  bus bar (70) carried by the housing (14) effecting termi足 nation of the signal and ground conductors respectively.
