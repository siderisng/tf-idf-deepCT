<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a contact bar for producing gas-tight connections for printed rear wall wirings.The difficulty in the production of such compounds has so far been that the posts (3) of the relatively small and sensitive connectors with high pressure had to be pressed into the via-contacted holes (8).The invention solves this problem by making use of a contact rail housing (10) when pressing, which presses in the pressing operation on the connectors (2 to 5) itself, but to its holder (6), with which the individual connectors held together firmly togetherare.
