<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a motor vehicle ignition or annealing gear switch for independent, current and spin-slip switching multiple consumers with two in the driver or switching gear (5) arranged along the switch speed axis (9) arranged spring-loaded contact arms (22, 23) each with a contact head (22c, 23c) and end seige control (22b, 23b). Each control piece (22b, 23b) is guided on its own cam track (22 ', 23'). An axially shortcutable switch is created, which allows a large number of switching positions in small angles intervals without impairing the functional safety and control accuracy. The contact arms (22, 23) are roughened in the region of the switch rotary axis (9) about U-shaped against each other and arranged in a common level about cross. The contact heads (22c, 23c) are released radially outwardly at each of the two contact arms (22, 23) ge via the switch rotary axis (9), and the contact heads (22c, 23c) is at least one concentrically arranged Kon Taktring (10 ) Assigned as a counter contact.
