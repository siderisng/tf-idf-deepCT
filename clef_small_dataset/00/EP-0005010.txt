<ABSTRACT>
a carboxyl modified, metal-free petroleum resin comprising  a resin obtained by thermal polymerization of a feed  containing cyclopentadiene and or methylcyclopentadiene  and/or derivatives thereof having been reacted electrophilically  with a carboxylic acid, said modified resin having an acid  number less than 20, containing from 1 wt. % to 5 wt. % of  oxygen and having a softening point of from 120째c to 200째c.  these resins may be prepared by heating a resin  obtained by thermal polymerization of a feed containing a  cyclopentadiene and/or methylcyclopentadiene and/or derivatives  thereof with a carboxylic acid to a temperature in  the range 200째c to 270째c and subsequently removing free  acid to reduce the acid number to below 20.  these resins maybe used for offset printing inks, and  suitable printing ink compositions comprise (a) 5 to 30% by  weight of such a resin (b) 5 to 30% by weight of a drying oil,  (c) 20 to 40% by weight of a pigment, (d) 0 to 10% by weight  of an assistant, and (e) a solvent being the balance, the  weight percentages of components (a), (b), (c) and (d) being  based on the total weight of the composition.
