<ABSTRACT>
tractor hydraulic power lift mechanisms may have  automatic draft control signals fed back to them from lower  link draft force sensing systems.  one such system has two  bowed rearwardly-extending leaf springs (10) anchored to  the tractor frame (11) at their front ends, two laterally-spaced  arms (39) pivoted at their upper ends to the tractor frame (11)  and at their lower ends to the rear ends of the respective  springs (10), a cross-bar (29) universally supported by the  lower ends of the respective arms (39) and having two  attachment points (48) laterally offset from said arms to  which the front ends of respective lower hitch links (49) are  universally connectible, and means for deriving a control  signal from the fore and aft displacement of the mid-point of  the cross-bar (29).  however, the cross-bar (29) is stressed in  bending to the detriment of the control signal accuracy.  to  avoid this, a summating bar (53) is universally connected  between said arms (39) and the control signal derived from a  point on the unstressed summating bar.
