<DESCRIPTION>
an adjustable fastening device for a wc seat this invention relates to an adjustable fastening device, intended especially for wc seats, which can be used for securing a wc seat to various wc howls having different spacing of the fastening holes. the spacing of the fastening holes in wc seats by different producers differ greatly from each other and vary usually within the range of 130 to 240 mm. conventional wc seats have a fixed fastening device which fits to a certain spacing of the fastening holes. this has created problems when changing wc seats, whereby it has been found out that a new wc seat does not fit to the existing wc bowl. wc seats with an adjustable spacing of the fastening holes have been manufactured in order to solve the problem. however these have been defective and complicated in construction. the adjustable range has been small and the adjusting operation itself has been awkward and has required tools. further more, to adjust the spacing of the fastening parts, it has been necessary to measure in advance the exact spacing of the fastening holes as an easy stepless adjustment on a wc seat has been irrepossible. an example of a known construction is disclosed by the french patent publication 1.260.289, where the fastening bolts of a wc seat are movably joined to the fastening parts through a t-joint. it is an object of the invention to provide a simple fastening device for a wc seat with easy stepless adjustment. according to the invention the adjustable fastening device of a wc seat comprises an elongated rotatable shaft having two threaded portions, said portions being threaded in opposite directions, and being fixed to the back of the wc seat; fastening parts having counter-threads being fitted to the threaded portions of the shaft and moving symmetrically in relation to the center line of the wc seat when the shaft is rotated whereby the spacing of the fastening parts is changed. the invention is described in more detail below with refence to the enclosed drawing, where fig. 1 shows an adjustable fastening device, in connection with a wc seat, according to the invention seen from the back; fig. 2 shows the main parts of the fastening device detached from a wc seat seen from above and fig. 3 shows a section along line a - a in fig. 1 of the fastening device fixed to a wc seat. the main part of the fastening device is an elongated shaft 1, journalled to a wc seat ring 2 and going through the back of a wc seat. the center portion of the shaft is formed to an adjusting wheel 3 by which the shaft can be rotated. the shaft has portions 4 threaded in different directions on both sides of the adjusting wheel. fastening parts 5 of a wc seat provided with counter-threads are fitted to both the threaded portions 4; said parts 5 move along the shaft in opposite direction compared to each
