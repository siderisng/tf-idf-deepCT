<ABSTRACT>
a 3-sheeled velociman having individual power transmission  units (40) to each of the co-axial rear wheels (11, 12).   power to the unit is supplied by a pair of hand actuated  levers (50) each of which connects with an input shaft (41) to  the respective unit via a ratchet mechanism (55) and transmits  the power to the input shaft (41) in the desired forward  or reverse rotational direction, depending on the position of  a pawl engageable with the ratchet.  a gear change switch (60) controls the forward, reverse  or neutral position of the pawl and consequently the rotational  direction of the input shaft (41).  the switch (60) is adjacent  the hand grip (53) of each hand lever (50) and so is easily  operated by the user.  the input shaft (41) drives an output shaft (42) on which  the corresponding rear wheel (11, 12) is mounted.  the hand levers (50) are fulcrummed to the input shaft  (41) below and to the rear of the seat (18) and lie at an acute  angle to the horizontal making operation of the levers (50) by  the user less tiring on the user's arms than on upright levers.
