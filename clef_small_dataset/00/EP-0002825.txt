<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for drying particulate material includes an  elongate housing (2) having a chamber (11) therein.  a  drum (3) is positioned in the housing (2) and has opposite  ends thereof extending through open ends of the housing.  the drum (3) is mounted for rotation about its longitudinal  axis.  the exterior surface of the drum (3) and the  interior surface of the housing (2) are spaced apart and  form an annular space (11) adapted for flow of heating  medium therealong.  an inlet (8) opens into the annular  space (11) and is directed for introducing heating medium  in a generally tangential direction relative to the annular  space (11) such that the heating medium flows in a generally  vortex manner along the length of the annular space  (11) to the outlet (9).  a tube (30) is positioned in the drum (3) and extenas  along a major portion of the length of the drum.  the tube  (30) is in flow communication with the annular space (11)  for receiving heating medium therefrom.  the heating medium  flows along the tube (30) for heating the particulate  material in the drum (3) and the heating medium in the  tube (30) is discharged into the interior of the drum (3)  for direct contact with the particulate material and further  heating thereof.  the material to be dried is introduced into  one end (20) of the drum (3) and discharged from the  other end (24) of the drum (3) after drying.
