<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to immunologic compositions  comprising pyruvic aldehyde or dimethylsuberimidate stabilized  erythrocytes sensitized with a polypeptide or glycoprotein  antigen by coupling of the stabilized erythrocytes to the  antigen with bifunctional molecules, and to methods for preparing  these compositions.  also disclosed are antiserum  compositions which may be utilized with the described  stable, sensitized erythrocytes of this invention as reagents  in haemagglutination tests, and methods for their preparation.   the invention further comprises lyophilization of these  compositions and siliconized vials for use with the reagents  of this invention.
