<ABSTRACT>
In a molding apparatus for an injection molding machine, a molded carrier piatate (1) is hydraulically displaceably arranged by means of a rapid trajector (10, 11, 12) and a double-acting main piston (6) led in a maintzy linder, through which the master cylinder chamber into an opening-side and in a closing side The master cylinder space (7 and 8) is divided, both of which are connected to each other via a lockable through channel (16, 17, 18), which is located in the main piston (6). In order to use only pressure medium with system pressure for both the control and loading of the main piston (6), the mold closing device is configured so that the main piston (6) has a preferably coaxial cylinder chamber in which a pressure valley piston (13) axially displaceable which divides the cylinder of the room into an opening-side partial chamber (14) and into a closed-side partial space (15) so as to be formed by the gang channel so that the closed-side part space (15) a connecting opening (16) to the opening mixed cylinder space ( 7) and a circular opening (17) closable by axial vapor opening (17) for closing the master cylinder chamber (8) has the pressure translation piston (13) for producing an increased pressure two oppositely rich tete piston surfaces of different sizes has the larger one Piston surface (19) to the opening-side partial space (14) and the smaller piston surface (20) faces the closed-side partial space (15) that the smaller piston surface (20) only after closing the umlau opening (17) by a flask outstanding from the smaller piston surface (20), with the pressure translator piston-tightened closure piston (21) and that the opening-side partial chamber (14) and the opening-side mainty linder space (7) via connecting lines (22) and (23) are connected to a common pressure line (24).
