<ABSTRACT>
fluids based on phosphoric acid esters, or mixtures  thereof, containing a corrosion and hydrolysis inhibitor, are  useful fire resistant materials.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
fire resistant fluids this invention relates to fire resistant (difficultly inflammable) fluids based on esters of phosphoric acid. more particularly, the invention relates to a fire resistant fluid based on a phosphoric acid ester or a mixture of phosphoric acid esters and containing a corrosion and hydrolysis inhibitor. hydraulic fluids based on phosphoric acid esters have been used for some time. they have characteristics suitable therefor; particularly, they are not easily inflammable, so that they are used above all in systems comprising closed hydraulic circuits such as hydraulic systems of turbines and of pressure casting, continuous casting and press plants. the use of such fluids is described for example in u.s. patent 3,468,802 and u.s. patent 3,723,315. although such fluids are not easily inflammable and of relatively high thermal stability, they may, in certain applications, possess insufficient resistance to oxidation and/or hydrolysis or they may be highly corrosive to certain metals. to remedy such defects of the known fluids certain inhibitors may be added thereto. for example, certain aminopyridines may be added as antioxidants (u.s. patent 3,783,132). also, oxazolines and imidazolines may be added as rust inhibitors (british patent 1,317,636). finally, it is known to use certain amino compounds as corrosion inhibitors (u.s. patent 3,468,802). however, many of the proposed rust inhibitors show undesirable side effects which impair the applicability of the hydraulic fluid. in accordance with the invention there is provided a fire resistant fluid comprising a phosphate ester and a corrosion or hydrolysis inhibiting amount of piperazine or a substituted piperazine. the fluid of the invention may be useful as a lubricant, a hydraulic fluid, a transformer oil or for a variety of other purposes wherein a fire resistant fluid is required. the problem underlying this invention is to develop a fire resistant fluid having improved characteristics compared to those of known fluids used in hydraulic systems, especially with regard to corrosion inhibition and/or hydrolytic stability. this is achieved by a fire resistant fluid based on a phosphoric acid ester or a mixture of phosphoric acid esters and containing piperazine and/or at least one piperazine derivative as corrosion and/or hydrolysis inhibitor. the use of such additives in phosphate esters confers not only improved hydrolytic stability but also better corrosion inhibiting properties; particularly, the rust-preventing properties are improved. the proportion of piperazine or piperazine derivative in fluids according to the invention is in the range of 0.005 to 5% by weight and is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 0.5% by weight. the phosphate esters used as the base for fire resistant fluids are mainly aryl esters of phosphoric acid. the triaryl esters are particularly preferred because they are clearly superior in regard to fire resistance but diaryl alkyl phosphate esters may also be employed. the preferred triaryl phosphate esters include, inter alia, tricresyl phosphate ester, trixylyl phosphate ester, phenyl dicresyl phosphate ester, cresyl diphenyl phosphate ester and tri(isopropylphenyl) phosphate ester, di(isopropylphenyl) phenyl phosphate ester and isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate ester. diphenyl-2-ethylhexyl phosphate ester is an example of the
