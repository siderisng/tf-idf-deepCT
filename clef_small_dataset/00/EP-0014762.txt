<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for remote inspection of annular curved ridge  welds (42).  included in such apparatus is a small sized televi­ sion camera (46), an annular image transformation lens (50) of  greater size than the observed weld (42) for presenting a  flattened expanded image of such weld (42) to the camera, a  circular array of work-illumination lamps (63) at the input end  of the camera (46), and a hollow cylindrical light conductive  member (60) mounted at its one end on the input end of the  camera in exposure to the lamps (63) and mounting the image  transformation lens (50) on its opposite end for proximity to  the annular weld 42) being inspected.  with this apparatus an enlarged flattened picture of the  weld is presented to the camera for fast and thorough inspec­ tion of the weld.
