<ABSTRACT>
in a gas filter, especially a room air filter (1) comprising a  rectangular frame (2), a replaceable filter pack (4) which  includes a filter web (7) arranged in zig-zag fashion to form a  plurality of filter pockets disposed in side-by-side relationship  which is mounted between peripheral walls is adapted to be  received within the frame by a supporting grid structure (3)  which is mounted within the frame and shaped to match the  plies of the filter web.  in order to provide a gas filter which is easy to handle and  whose filter pack can also be transported without causing any  trouble even, when it is in contaminated condition all  peripheral walls (8, 9, 10 and 11) of the filter pack are stiff and  jointly define a rigid container, the gas inlet opening (13) of  this container being adapted to be closed by folding and  bending marginal portions (r) of the peripheral walls (8, 9, 10  and 11) adjacent to this opening, and plies (21) provided  adjacent the gas outlet opening (14) are held by tensioning  means (22) which extend in the direction of the plies and are  anchored to opposed peripheral walls (8, 10).
