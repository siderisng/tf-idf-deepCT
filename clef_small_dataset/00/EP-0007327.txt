<ABSTRACT>
a method of collecting blood from an animal in which a  stunned animal is suspended from a conveyor while a portion  of hide is stripped to expose an area adjacent a major blood  vessel.  a sterilized piercing instrument is inserted into said  blood vessel.  the blood is conducted to a container which is  supported on a separate conveyor system running parallel to  the conveyor.  the instrument comprises an elongate flat and  pointed blade (11) provided with two spaced coplanar limb  portions (11b) and outwardly bowed retaining rods (18,20).   the blade is attached to a body (14) holding a handle (26)  which defines a passageway (30) to the end opening (31) of  which a conduit may be connected.  a passageway (30a)  opens laterally into passageway (30) for dripping anticoaguÂ­ lant additive.  a sterilizing unit is also disclosed comprising a  hollowbody to receive the piercing instrument in which it is  flushed with hot and cold water.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for collection of blood from animals. although it has been appreciated that animal blood has a wide use, particularly as a source of protein, it has not so far been possible to remove the blood from the animal, and to subsequently handle it, in such a manner that it would meet the various standards laid down by health authorities for the handling of constituents for foodstuffs. it is therefore the object of this invention to provide a method and an instrument which will enable the blood to be collected from a slaughtered animal in a sterile condition. with this object in view there is provided a a method of collecting blood from an animal comprising suspending a stunned animal, stripping a portion of the hide of the animal to expose an area adjacent a major artery or vein of the animal, inserting a sterilized self piercing hollow instrument through the exposed area into the vein or artery and conducting the blood in a sterile manner from the instrument to a container in which the blood is thereby collected. the instrument may remain in the animal as it moves with a conveyor until bleeding is completed which in a normal size cow or bullock is approximately three minutes. it will be appreciated that as the animal is initially in a stunned condition the animal's heart will pump the blood from the animal's body through the instrument and into the container. upon removal of the instrument it is preferably sterilized and subsequently returned down the conveyor line for use on a subsequent animal. the method may further include inspecting the condition of the carcass of the animal following completion of blood collection and selectively directing the blood collected in the container to one of a plurality of further storages in dependence on said inspection. the invention also provides an instrument for taking blood from an animal comprising a body defining a passageway therethrough and a pair of openings from the passageway to one of which a conduit may be connected, and piercing element supported in or in adcance of the other of said openings. the instrument may comprise a hollow tube having an opening intermediate the ends of the tube to which a conduit may be connected, and a piercing element supported in the tube for selective axial movement therein between an extended position projecting from one end of the tube to a retracted position in the tube substantially between the branch and the other end of the tube, the piercing element may be carried on a rod which extends through the other end of the tube in a sealed relation and has an external handle to permit manually controlled movement of the piercing element between tbe extended and retracted positions. the instrument may alternatively comprise an elongate blade which projects from an end portion of the instrument, the said end portion having a lengthwise passageway therethrough and retaining means operable to oppose
