<ABSTRACT>
a video signal recording and reproducing apparatus in  which the luminance signal of a color video signal is fre­ quency-modulated for recording and a reproduction fre­ quency-modulated signal is frequency-demodulated to pro­ duce a reproduction video signal.  a high frequency compo­ nent is separated from the reproduction video signal and  applied to a slice circuit (33, 42, 53) comprising nonlinear  elements including, for example, diodes connected in paral­ lel in reverse polarities, thus eliminating noise at the flat  portion included in the high frequency component.  the  apparatus further comprises a device (35, 43, 47) for sub­ tracting the sliced signal and the reproduced video signal  one from the other in such a manner that the two signals are  in phase with each other substantially at the desired ratio  and in predetermined frequency band.  in this way, noise  contained in the edge portion of the reproduction video  signal, crosstalk and moiré patterns caused at the time of  azimuth recording without guardband are decreased, thus  improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the edge portion.  if  this apparatus is combined with a conventional device for  reducing noise at the flat portion, fm interleaving tech­ niques and nonlinear emphasis, a high-density recording  with narrow tracks and short wavelength is made possible,  thereby producing a stable reproduced image with high s/n  ratio having no undesired components.
