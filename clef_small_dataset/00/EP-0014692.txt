<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a mode coupler which, for exam­ ple is included in an angle tracking system of a satellite to  establish a telecommunication between the transmitting and  the receiving ground stations.  the mode coupler is realized  through a circular main wave guide (1) which also can include  the feeding horn of the satellite antenna in which a basic  mode, for example the te₁₁-mode of the incoming circular  polarized wave guide field appears and which procures two  communication channels (f₁-f₂ and f₃-f₄ respectively), as well  as a beacon frequency (fb).  to the main wave guide four  rectangular wave guide arms (2a-2d) are connected via the  associated apertures (3a-3d).  the main wave guide is dimen­ sioned as a mode filter for filtering away the non-desired  higher modes te₂₁ and tm₀₁ and the wave guide arms are  dimensioned as a frequency filter for filtering away the fre­ quency bands of the communication channels.  from the  higher modes te₂₁ and tm₀₁, the difference- and the sum  signals are created in known way to provide a measure of the  angle error of the satellite antenna.

<DESCRIPTION>
mode coupler in an automatic angle tracking system field of the invention the present invention relates to a mode coupler according to the preamble of the claim 1, included in an automatic angle tracking system in microwave antennas, operating with circular polarization. the tracking system can be included in a satellite for telecommunication between one or several transmitting ground stations and a number of receiving ground stations, the tracking system keeping the antenna of the satellite directed towards a certain area of the ground by means of a so called beacon signal from one of the transmitting ground stations. description of prior art it is previously known that higher order modes arise in microwave antennas, the modes having odd character when the receiving radiation incides obliguely towards the antenna. the number of modes obtained is determined by the cut-off wavelength of the respective mode in the feeding wave guide and if this is greater than the actual wavelength. the strength of the odd modes in relation to the even basic mode for a certain antenna only depends on the angle deviation and is for a small amount approximately proportional to this deviation. by "mode coupler is in the present application meant an arrangement which can separate the basic mode from the various higher order modes and deliver output signals proportional to the strength of the various higher modes a known tracking system with the property to detect a certain deviation (the pointing error) between the reflector axis of a ground station and the direction of a target by separating the higher order modes from the basic mode is described in bell system technical journal, july 1963, pages 1283-1307. in this system a circular waveguide is connected to the feeding horn, only the basic mode being formed in the wave guide if the pointing error is zero, i e if the antenna is perfectly directed towards the target. otherwise higher modes arise in the wave guide, among which one, namely the tm01 is employed to form error signals together with the basic mode and which are allowed to control the regulating circuits in the antenna system of the ground station so that #the pointing error will- become zero. in the mode coupler a sum signal is obtained from the basic mode and a difference signal from the higher mode tmo1 the error signals, for example in the elevation and the azimuth directions are in the receiver of the tracking system indicated by means of the difference and the sum signals, the amplitude and the phase position of the difference signal relatively the sum signal de#termining the magnitude of the angle deviation of the target from the antenna axis and the direction of the deviation, respectively. to obtain good accuracy in this system, a very good phase equality between the signal paths is required for the sum and the difference signals, particularly at off- boresight tracking. as also shown in the mentioned article, the system is sensible to changes in the polarization
