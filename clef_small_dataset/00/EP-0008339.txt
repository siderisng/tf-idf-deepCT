<ABSTRACT>
in skinning machines having a hide-stripping drum (10), a flap of skin of the animal to be skinned is introduced into a loop (24) formed by a chain (20) or a rope which is attached to the drum, and is wound onto the said drum during skinning.  the chain (20) or the rope possesses an eye (22) through which the chain (20) or the rope can be passed to form the loop (24).  in order to free the stripped skin (26) from the chain (20), the loop (24) has to be enlarged by hand.  this is usually possible only when the chain (20) or rope is free of load.  simple and automatic detachment is only possible by a method wherein a rope (30) extends between the inside wall (14) of the drum and the eye (22) in such a manner that, when the stripped skin (6) is wound on, the rope (30) is released from tension and, during detachment, is apparently shortened relative to the chain (20).  thus, during detachment, the eye (22) must slide along the chain (20) in such a manner that the loop (24) is enlarged and the hide (26) automatically slips out of this loop (24).  <image>
