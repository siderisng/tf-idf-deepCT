<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention the present invention relates to optically active cephalosporin analogs and, more particularly, it pertains to optically active compounds of cephalosporin analogs represented by the general formula (i) emi1.1 wherein r1 represents a hydrogen or a lower alkyl group, r2 represents a hydrogen or a halogen atom, r3 represents a hydrogen or protective group of carboxylic acid, and the hydrogens at the 6- and 7-positions have cis configuration, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and processes for producing the same. heretofore, a carbacephem compound, which is named according to the nomenclature in j. am. chem. soc. 96, 7584 (1974), wherein the sulfur atom of cephalosporin is substituted with a carbon atom and which has a 'substituted methyl group at the 3-position is described in the above reference and j. med chem. 20, 551 (1977). however, no compound of this type having strong antibacterial activity especially has been reported. the present inventors have succeeded in preparing. carbacephem compounds having various substituents at the 4-, 5- and 3-positions [the numbering system is as shown in general formula (l)j. the compounds are described in the specifications of japanese patent applications no. 34696/78 (japanese published unexamined patent application no.128591/79) (german offenelegungsschrift 2911786, referred as "g.o:" hereinafter), 122403/78, 133072/78, 162005/78 and 8408/79. further, the present inventors have succeeded in preparing novel acylated carbacephems which are new antibiotics having strong antibacterial activities. these are described in japanese patent applications no. 34696/78 (japanese published unexamined patent application no. 128591/79), 122402/78, 127027/78, 133071/78, 162006/78, 162007/78, 162008/78, 8409/79 and g.o. 2911787. however, cephalosporin analog mentioned above are prepared by synthetic methods using optically inactive starting compounds, and they are optically inactive dl lrepresented by ( compounds unless they have optically active acyl group. more specifically, compounds represented by the general formula (i) wherein the hydrogen atoms at the 6- and 7-positions have cis configuration are present as a mixture of equal amounts of the mirror image compounds represented by the formulae (i-1) and (i-2) emi2.1 wherein r1, r2 and r3 have the same significance as defined above. however, no method of isolating one of these enantiomers has been reported. to this end, it has now ben found that one of the optically active mirror image compounds can be prepared and isolated. summary of the invention in accordance with the present invention, optically active compounds are prepared of cephalosporin analogs represented by the formula: emi3.1 (wherein r1 represents a hydrogen or a lower alkyl group, r2 represents a hydrogen or a halogen atom, r3 represents a hydrogen or a protective group of carboxylic acid and the hydrogens at the 6- and 7-positions have cis configuration) and salts thereof. in the foregoing general formula (i), the lower alkyl group r1 is a straight or branched alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, i-propyl group, n-butyl group, i-butyl group, sec-butyl group, t-butyl-group, and the like. the ester group coor3 is a group readily convertible to cooh employed in the chemistry of
