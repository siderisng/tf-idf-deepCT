<ABSTRACT>
a rock breaker comprising a tool insertable in a hole in a  rock and fed through a supply line (52) with an incompressible  liquid to maintain a column of the liquid in the hole, and  means (60,61) to apply to the liquid a shock means sufficiently  high to fracture the rock.  the tool comprises a hollow stem  having an expansible collet (5) to lock the tool in a hole and a  resilient sealing member (15) to form a liquid seal for the tool  in the hole.  in order to provide a simple arrangement which  can readily be locked in and released from the hole, the tool  has a sleeve (14,16) which is forced axially along the hollow  stem of the tool to act on the sealing member (15) and collet  (5) by a nut (11) screwed on to the upper end of the stem and  bearing on the upper end of the sleeve (14).  the nut is turned  by a handle (10) acting on the nut through a ratchet to force the  sleeve downwardly and thereby expand the collet and sealing  member.
