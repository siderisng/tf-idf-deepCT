<ABSTRACT>
detergent compositions having regulated suds over a  broad range of usage and laundry temperature conditions  containing an organic surface-active agent and a mixture of  suds regulating components are disclosed.  the suds regulating  agent is a mixture of a liquid hydrocarbon in conjunction  with an adjunct material, which can be a solid hydrocarbon  or a fatty ester, and a hydrophobic silica suds regulating  agent.  the subject compositions are capable of providing  effective and uniform suds regulating activity over the complete  range of laundry temperatures from ambient temperature  up to the boil and are generally independent of soil load,  water hardness and other incidental factors known to interfere  with the suds regulating activity.
