<DESCRIPTION>
heterocyclic compounds, processes for their preparation, pesticidal compositions containing them and methods of combating pests this invention relates to imidazole and triazole compounds useful as fungicides and plant growth regulators, to a process for preparing them, to compositions containing them, and to a method of combating fungal infections in, and regulating the growth of, plants using them. the present invention provides compounds having the general formula (i) emi1.1 wherein each of r1 and r2, which may be the same or different, is unsubstituted or alkyl-substituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or halo-substituted alkyl or unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, y is =n- or =ch- and z is c = o or a derivative thereof (e.g. an imine, oxime, ketal, hydrazone or semicarbazone); and esters, ethers, acid addition salts and metal complexes thereof; and isomers of any of the foregoing. the compounds of the invention contain chiral centres. the compounds are generally obtained in the form of racemic mixtures. however, these and other mixtures can be separated into the individual isomers by methods known in the art e.g. chromatography. in many cases, the compounds can be prepared stereospecifically in the form of a single diastereoisomer. the alkyl groups, which can be straight or branched chain, preferably have 1 to 5 carbon atoms; examples are methyl, ethyl, propyl (n- or i-propyl) and butyl (n-, i- or t-butyl). suitable substituents for the phenyl group are halogen, c1-4 alkyl [e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl (n- or i-propyl) and butyl (n-, i- or t-butyl)], halo(c1-4 alkyl) (e.g. chloro- or bromo- methyl), hydroxy (c1 4 alkyl) (e.g. hydroxymethyl), phenyl, halophenyl (e.g. chlorophenyl), cycloalkyl, nitro, cyano, c14 alkoxy (e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy), c2-4 alkenyloxy (e.g. allyloxy), (c14 alkylene)dioxy (e.g. methylendioxy), (c1-4 alkoxy) (c1-4 alkyl) [e.g. methoxy- or ethoxy- methyl or 2-methoxy- or ethoxy-ethyl], mercapto, c1-4 alkyl) thio [e.g. methyl- or ethyl-thio], (c1-4 alkyl) sulphonyl l-e.g. methyl- or ethyl-sulphonyl], (c1 4 haloalkyl)sulphonyl 5e.g. trifluoromethylsulphonyl], phenylsulphonyl, unsubstituted or mono- or di (c1 4 alkyl) substituted sulphamoyl or carbamoyl, 1pyrrolidinylsulphonyl, carboxy, (c1 4 alkoxy)carbonyl l-e.g. methoxy or ethoxy-carbonylg, hydroxy, c1-6 alkanoyloxy, benzoyloxy, carboxy (c1 4 alkyl)oxy (e.g. carboxymethoxy or l-carboxyethoxy), unsubstituted or mono- or di- (c1¯4 alkyl) substituted amino, (c1 6 alkanoyl)amino, n-(c1-4 alkyl)-n-(c1-6 alkanoyl)amino, formylamino, n-(c1 4 alkyl) formylamino, phenylethyl, methylenedioxyphenyl, phenoxy or benzyloxy. a suitable alkanoyl is acetyl or propionyl. the phenyl group can have more than one substituent; examples of polysubstituted groups are those substituted with up to the maximum possible number (especially 1, 2 or 3) of for example halogen (particularly chlorine) atoms and/or nitro, methyl or methoxy groups. examples of suitable phenyl groups are phenyl itself, chlorophenyl (for example o-, m- or p-chloro- phenyl), dichlorophenyl (e.g. 3,4-, 2,4-, 3,5- or 2,6dichlorophenyl), trichlorophenyl (e.g. 2,3,6- or 2,4,5trichlorophenyl), tetrachlorophenyl, pentachlorophenyl, bromophenyl (e.g. o-, m- or p-bromphenyl), dibromophenyl (e.g. 2,4-dibromophenyl), fluorophenyl (e.g. o-, m- or fluorophenyl), difluorophenyl (e.g. 2,4- or 3,4-difluorophenyl), pentafluorophenyl, iodophenyl (e.g. o-iodophenyl), aminophenyl (e.g. p-aminophenyl), methylphenyl (e.g. o- m- or p-methylphenyl), dimethylphenyl (e.g. 2,6-, 2,5- or 3,4-dimethylphenyl), ethylphenyl (e.g. p- ethylphenyl), propylphenyl (e.g. -i-propylphenyl), butylphenyl (e.g. p-t-butylphenyl), cyanophenyl
