<ABSTRACT>
a method of manufacturing rolling bearing outer race  members, wherein drawn cups (18) are first produced from  circular metal blanks (10) in a conventional manner in a  multi-plunger transfer press in which the metal blanks (10)  are preliminarily shaped and formed in known manner by  cooperation between successively arranged forming tools  (14, 22) and dies (12, 24).  in order to produce a bearing cup which has a sharp  squared corner at its outer diameter, thus enabling the cup to  be satisfactorily used with circlips, the initially drawn bearing  cup (18) is successively passed to a number of work stations  in the same machine, each station comprising a die (26, 32)  and a forming tool in the form of a punch (28, 34), wherein a  compressing or impact forging action is used to fill in the  curved base corners of the cup and produce the desired  sharp squared corner (18a).
