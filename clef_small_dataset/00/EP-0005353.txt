<ABSTRACT>
fish or other aquatic farm material is transported  in a heat-insulated bulk load container (1) which is adapted  to hold liquid and has a refrigeration system (9).   the container preferably forms the tipping body of a  vehicle as shown in the drawing.  the fish is loaded in bulk  into the container together with sufficient liquid to keep  the fish wet and prevent crushing and the refrigeration  system is operated to keep the fish in refrigerated but wet  condition during transportation.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and apparatus for storing and transporting aquatic food materials under refrigerated conditions the conventional method of transporting fish from fishing ports to inland fish markets involves temporary storage of the catch in tanks at the fishing port and their eventual packaging with ice in boxes which are then loaded into vehicles for overland transportation. these procedures impose appriciable delays between the unloading of the fish from the fishing vessels and the arrival of the fish on the food market, and involve large handling costs which are necessarily reflected in the market price of the fish. apart from the labour involved in boxing up, the actual loading of the boxes onto transport vehicles is very expensive. for example, it often takes about 6 hours to load 18 tons of filled boxes onto a transport vehicle. an appreciable fraction of the transportation cost is attributable to thr boxes. an 18 ton load includes about 4 tons of boxes. a further serious disadvantage of the conventional procedures is that a substantial proportion of the tonnage of fish brought into port cannot be kept in prime condition for the period of time necessary for it to reach the inland fish markets where it would otherwise command a very good price. the period of time for which much sea food will remain in good condition while boxed in ice is strictly limited. pelagic fish for example are very prone to rancidity when boxed for one or two days, even when kept in modern refrigerated transporters operating between sea ports and inland markets. in consequence certain inland areas cannot obtain sea foods in top quality condition through the normal channels of distribution and supply and such foods are then available only at very inflated prices. the fish boxes themselves tend to harbour unhygenic conditions and this is often a contributory factor in the deterioration of the food prior to marketing. the present invention aims to provide a method of storage and transportation by which aquatic farm material, particularly fish, can be made available to food markets with less risk of deterioration and/or with appreciably lower handling costs. according to the invention there is provided a method of transporting fish or other aquatic farm material for the food market, which method comprises providing a heat-insulated transportable bulk load container which is adapted to hold a bulk load comprising both solid and liquid material and which has an associated refrigeration system; loading that container with the farm material in bulk and with sufficient liquid to keep the farm material in wet condition; and transporting the said container while keeping the farm material therein in refrigerated wet condition by means of such refrigeration system. in the nature of the invention, its potential benefits are best realised when using a large container having a load-carrying capacity say in excess of 15 tons. the invention involves a quite radical departure from conventional practice in the handling of fish and other sea food between fishing ports or harbours and inland delivery

claims:   1. a method of transporting fish or other aquatic farm material for the food market, which method comprises providing a heat-insulated transportable bulk load container which is adapted to hold a bulk load comprising both solid and liquid material and which has an associated refrigeration system; loading that container with the farm material in bulk and with sufficient liquid to keep the farm material in wet condition; and transporting the said container while keeping the farm material therein in refrigerated wet condition by means of such refrigeration system.   2. a method according to claim 1, wherein the aquatic farm material is sea food which is loaded into the container direct from a fishing vessel.   3. a method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the bulk load container forms the tipping body of a road or rail vehicle, such body having at least one sealable filling hatch and an end closure wall which makes a liquid-tight seal and can be opened to allow the container to be emptied by tipping the body.   4. a method according to any preceding claim, wherein cooling of the contents of the load container is achieved by a coolant which is caused to flow through passageways in heat conductive relationship with the interior of the container.     5. a method according to any preceding claim, wherein the contents of the container are cooled at least in part by introduction of vaporised coolant into the container, above the surface of the bulk load.   6. a refrigerated load-carrying vehicle having a heat-insulated bulk load-carrying tipping body in the form of a container which has an associated refrigeration system and provides a liquid-tight storage space, such body having at least one sealable filling hatch and an end closure wall which makes a liquid tight seal and can be opened to allow the container to be emptied by tipping the body.    7. a vehicle according to claim 6, wherein refrigerant passageways are formed in or carried by a wall or walls of the load-carrying body and a refrigerant source or generator is supported by the vehicle independently of the tipping body and connected with such passageways so that the connections do not have to be broken when the body is tipped.   8. a vehicle according to claim 7, wherein such connections comprise flexible conduits which extend to and from the tipping body at a region adjacent its tipping axis.
