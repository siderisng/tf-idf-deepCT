<ABSTRACT>
a process for recovering rhodium present in a still heel  from the hydroformylation of an unsaturated hydrocarbon  wherein rhodium and a triaryl phosphite ligand were used by  a process comprising   a) pretreating the still heel with a compatible  organic solvent, at least 5 ml of water per 100 g of  still heel, oxygen gas or a precursor thereof and  sufficient base to produce a ph of 2 to 7 in the  reaction mixture after rhodium precipitation;   b) heating to a temperature of from 0° to 80°c to  oxidize the triaryl phosphite ligand to the corresponding  phosphate compound;   c) heating the mixture from b) for from about 15  minutes to about 120 minutes at about 115°c to  about 175°c to precipitate the rhodium and  optionally purifying the rhodium from c) by   d) separating the rhodium precipitate;   e) washing the rhodium precipitate with a solvent-acid  solution at a ph of 3 to 4;   f) treating the rhodium precipitate with an alkaline  reducing solution to reduce the trivalent rhodium  impurity to zero valent rhodium;   g) quenching the rhodium with glacial acetic acid;   h) separating the rhodium;   i) washing the rhodium with an acid solution at a  ph of 3 to 4;   j) drying the rhodium in an inert atmosphere at  from 250° to 400°c;  and   k) oxidizing the rhodium at a temperature of from  300° to 900°c to convert the rhodium to rn₂o₃.
