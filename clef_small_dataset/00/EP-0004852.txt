<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for scanning patterns with a regulated light source. In the scanning of recording media, interference factors occur which result from fluctuating remission degree of the recording medium (A) and changing distance of the light source (L1, L2) from the scanning pad of the recording medium (A) to be illuminated, especially in the case of hand readers. With a control loop for the light source (L1, L2), this undesirable information is eliminated in the image signal by controlling the illumination intensity. In the scanning device, a sensor surface (SF) converts the light (RL remedied from the scanning field of the recording medium (A) in electrical signals. A sum signal formed is the measured variable which is delayed and compared in a comparison circuit (VS) with a predetermined setpoint (SW). The output signal of the comparison circuit (VS) controls an actuator (SG) in the circuit of the light source (L1, L2). Since the interference factors mentioned are particularly serious when different recording media are to be scanned and the recording media can not be transported automatically during the scan, the device is particularly advantageously applied to manually guided handloat devices.
