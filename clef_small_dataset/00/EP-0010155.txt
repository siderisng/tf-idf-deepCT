<ABSTRACT>
in a magnetic recording system utilizing a non-return-to-Â­ zero format the reproduced recording is fed to positive and  negative threshold detectors (ta1, ta2) having no need for  electrical hysteresis as well as, via differentiator means (df),  to a zero-crossing detector (ta3).  the signal from the positive  threshold detector and one polarity of the signal from the  zero-crossing detector are used to trigger a latch means (l1,  l2) to a first state to emit a signal having a first level, and the  signal from the negative threshold detector and the other  polarity of the signal from the zero-crossing detector are used  to trigger the latch means to a second state whereby the signal  emitted by the latch means is switched to a second level.
