<ABSTRACT>
1.  method for controlling the operation of an electrolysis apparatus which operates under pressure and is intended for the production of gas by electrolysing aqueous solutions, and in which the pressure of the gases produced by the apparatus is measured and this pressure is adjusted to a reference value, characterised in that the said reference value pc of the pressure is formulated in accordance with a predetermined function pc = f (uc , i, t), for a given electrolysis apparatus having given internal characteristics, in which uc is the cell voltage, i is the current intensity which is proportional to the production capacity, and t is the operating temperature, this predetermined function being such that the reference value pc corresponds to a thermally balanced operation of the electrolysis apparatus, in such a manner that the temperature t is maintained equal to the desired operating temperature.
