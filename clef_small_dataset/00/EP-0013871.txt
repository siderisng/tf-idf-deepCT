<ABSTRACT>
For cooling from burned material (8), such as sintering or pellets, this is broken after leaving a continuous furnace system (1) and cooled in its own cooler (11) with injected air. To return the cooling heat into the focal process, the cooling air in countercurrent is pressed by the material (8) passing through the cooler (11) and then the entire amount of air of the heat treatment zone (5) in the furnace system (1) is supplied. An apparatus for performing this coolingver has a standing shaft cooler (11) which holds a transverse, annular slot table (18). The slot table (18) cooperates with a pyramid or conical material slide (21), which is arranged coaxially with the shaft cooler (11) at a distance from the thrust table (18) and with its tip below the coating area (22) of one over a crusher (9) Od. Like. With the material output of the furnace system (1) relating to the filling shaft (10). In the area of ​​the thrust (18), the inlet opening (14 ') for the cooling air is provided and the shaft cooler (11) closes with a tapered upper part (11a) to a pipeline (1) leading to the heating zone (5) of the furnace system (1). 15, 17).
