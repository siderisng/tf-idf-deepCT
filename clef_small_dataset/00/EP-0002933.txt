<ABSTRACT>
the relative malignancy or benignity of a sample of  cells suspected of being cancerous is determined by assaying  intracellular constituents of the said cells to determine  the rate of aerobic glycolysis as a function of the degree  to which pyruvate kinase in the cells is inhibited by the  presence of adenosine triphosphate.  by this method an  essentially quantitative assessement of the degree of malignancy  or benignity may be made whithout the uncertainties  which accompany histological assessement.
