<ABSTRACT>
a patching and sealing composition able to develop a  superior bond with the silica refractories of a coke oven at  temperature of 649° to 1316°c comprises three basic compo­ nents: (1) a high melting phase, such as silica brick, fireclay  grog, magnesia or high alumina grain, (2) a bonding compo­ nent, such as sodium silicate and (3) a low melting phase,  such as window glass.  it will generally be desirable to employ  a fourth component for fluxing, such as soda ash or other  alkaline earth compounds.  the improved results are achieved  by the use primarily, of a low melting phase such as window  glass, bulb glass or lead glass having a softening point of 482°  to 954°c employed in an amount of 6 to 25% of the total solids  composition.
