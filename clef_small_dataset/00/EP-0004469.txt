<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method and apparatus for  discharging material from a bulk container.  the apparatus comprises a bulk container (10) having  a discharge opening (12) in its base, and vibratory delivery  means (11) for conveying material from the discharge  opening (12) of the container to a second discharge opening  (19).  the delivery means (11) have an inlet (18) connected  to the discharge opening (12) of the container by  means (31) including a flexible portion (32).  to assist the  passage of the material from the container to the delivery  means, the delivery means (11) are vibrated in a manner  which transmits vibrations through the flexible portion (32)  of the connecting means to the container.  the container may be a fixed container or part of a  mobile unit in which the container (10) and the delivery  means (11) are supported on the same frame (15).
