<DESCRIPTION>
articles and methods for treating fabrics technical field the present invention pertains to articles and methods for providing softening and antistatic benefits to fabrics, and especially to the providing of these benefits by treatment of the fabrics in an automatic laundry dryer. more specifically, damp fabrics are contacted with a carboxylic acid salt of a long chain tertiary amine in an automatic clothes dryer and are thereby provided with a soft, antistatic finish concurrently with the drying operation. the softening and antistatic carboxylic acid salt of a long chain tertiary amine is preferably employed in combination with a dispensing means adapted for use in an automatic dryer. background of the invention treatment in an automatic clothes dryer has been shown to be an effective means for imparting desirable tactile properties to fabrics. for example, it is becoming common to soften fabrics in an automatic clothes dryer rather than during the rinse cycle of a laundering operation. (see gaiser, u.s. patent 3,442,692 , issued may 6, 1969). fabric "softness" is an expression well-defined in the art and is usually understood to be that quality of the treated fabric whereby its handle or texture is smooth, pliable and fluffy to the touch. various chemical compounds have long been known to possess the ability to soften fabrics when applied to them during a laundering operation, particularly during the rinse cycle. fabric softness also connotes the absence of static "cling" in the fabrics, and the commonly used cationic fabric softeners provide both softening and antistatic benefits when applied to fabrics. the imparting of softening/antistatic benefits to fabrics can also be referred to by the more generic term, fabric conditioning. fatty alkyl cationic antistatic softening compounds and compositions designed for application to fabrics in an automatic dryer have been the subject of recent innovations. (see, for example, furgal, u.s. patent 3,634,947, issued january 18, 1972, and morton, u.s patent 3,686,025, issued august 22, 1972.) other fatty materials have been suggested for use as dryer-added fabric softeners/antistats. (see, for example, hewitt et al., u.s. patent 3,676,199, issued july 11, 1972, and zaki et al., u.s. patent 4,022,938, issued may 10, 1977.) the use of fatty amines and the salts of such amines as fabric conditioning agents in the washing and .rssiny cycles cf an automatic washer, as w211 as thc ri cycle of an automatic dryer, has been disclosed. (see for example, blomfield, u.s. patent 3,095,373, issued june 25, 1963; gaiser, u.s. patent 3,442,692, issued nay 6, 1969; gaiser, u.s. patent 3,895,128, issued july 15, 1975; and south african patent 69/3923.) the use of amines in a dryer context, however, is accompanied by odor problems and/or softening of the paint used on interior dryer surfaces. u.s. patent 4,077,891, beimesch et al., issued march 7, 1978, describes formic acid salts of primary amines as acceptable softeners for use in the dryer in that they do not produce amine odors and they reduce paint softening problems. although the use of formic acid salts of primary amines provides advantages
