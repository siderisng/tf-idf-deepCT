<ABSTRACT>
an acoustic apparatus and method for microscopic  imaging and spectroscopy.  the apparatus includes a plurality  of devices (10,12,14) for exciting an object (15) of interest so  that acoustic waves are propagated from the object.  these  devices include lasers, x-ray sources, microwave generators,  ultraviolet sources, and electric current generators.  the  acoustic waves propagated from the object of interest are  detected and the object of interest and the acoustic wave de­ tector (26) are moved with respect to each other in a raster  scanning pattern (17, 19).  the magnitude of the detected  acoustic waves and the corresponding raster pattern of the  object are recorded so that a visual image of the object can  be obtained (20).  in addition, the frequency of the exciting  electromagnetic radiation that excites the object can be va­ ried so that both the absorption spectra and the raman fre­ quency mode of the object can be determined.
