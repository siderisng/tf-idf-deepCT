<ABSTRACT>
a data processing system comprises a main memory  (100), a logical space number storage (480) for storing logical  space numbers, a logical address storage (400) for storing  logical addresses, address converter (600) for producing  physical addresses in response to the logical space numbers  and logical addresses to access the main memory.  the logical  space number storage (480) includes two storages (opm1,  opm2) for storing logical space numbers to be used in a data  access and a storage (ism) for storing a logical space number  to be used in an instruction access, thereby to reduce the time  required for the switching between logical space numbers at  the data processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
data processing system this invention relates to a data processing system utilizing a multiple logical space and more particularly to a data processing system of the type which makes use of a logical space exclusively used for an operating system or a program which manages to collvrcl the data processing system. rapid technical development in the field of computer memories in recent years contributes to proge- sive improvements in computer technology with a trend involved to an increased main memory capacity. it is general practice to incorporate an address conversion unit in such an improved computer so as to make conven- tional programs adaptive thereto. assuming an address for accessing a conventional memory generated according to a conventional program as a logical address, the address conversion unit converts the logical address along with a logical space number into an address for accessing a new memory or a physical address. the logical space is a space defined by the logical address. and one of a plurality of logical spaces is allotted to each program or each data. the plurality of logical spaces are mapped by means of the address conversion unit onto different regions on a memory. conventionally, in such a computer, a program which manages to control the execution of a user progr & l that is, an operating system (hereinafter simply referred to as os) is allotted with the same logical space as that for the user program. in other words, each logical space is divided into two regions, one region being for the os and the other being for the user program. recently, the controlling technique in computers has been highly advanced, and the os has become complicated more and more and its capacity has been increasing. accordingly, within one logical space, a region allotted to the os is increased whereas a region available for the user program is inevitably decreased. as a result, it is difficult to incorporate a large capacity user program in one logical space. according to an approach to solve this problem, one logical space is exclusively allotted to the (see japanese patent application laid-open no. 57929/ l9781 for example). however, when the os and the user trc#ram are allotted to different logical spaces, the o#esi for switching over the logical spaces becomes complicated, resulting in prolonged processing time. for example, let us consider a processing wherein a task program within the user program requests the os to process a data which is related to the task program and which is contained in the same logical space as the task program. the os first uses a logical space number for the task program requiring the processing in order to read out the data to be processed. subsequen? , when the 0 needs a data contained in a logical space allotted to the os for the sake of processing the data to be processed, it uses a logical space number os. at the termination of the processing, the space number for the task program is
