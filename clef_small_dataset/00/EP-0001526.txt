<ABSTRACT>
1.  process for the selective elimination of ether contained in powder granules which comprises immersing the powder granules in a liquid phase in which a gas is circulating, said powder granules having being manufactured by a process employing as solvent a mixture of an alkanol and an alkyl ether, characterised in that the liquid phase is a hydroalcoholic phase consisting of an aqueous dilution of the alkanol used as manufacturing solvent for said powder and which is present in an amount such that said liquid hydroalcoholic phase titrates between 20 and 70 degrees gay-lussac, the temperature of said hydroalcoholic phase being between 10 and 40 degrees c and in that the weight ratio of powder to be treated relative to the liquid alcoholic phase used is less than or equal to 1.
