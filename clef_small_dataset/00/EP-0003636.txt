an assembly for compression on to a strand cable or a wire rope comprises a sleeve (1) and a tubular insert (2) to be interposed between the sleeve and the cable or rope.  the insert (2) comprises a plurality of inter-linked insert portions (6) which are formed by helically coiling a rolled steel strip.  teeth (4) and side shoulders (5) are formed on the strip during rolling, the teeth being arranged to bite into the cable or rope and the shoulders being arranged to receive sleeve material when the sleeve is compressed.  the invention includes a method of compressing the assembly on to the cable or rope such that the insert portions (6) tend to move apart, and also includes the insert itself as an item of commerce.
