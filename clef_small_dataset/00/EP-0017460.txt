<ABSTRACT>
chlamydia trachomatis organisms are responsibe for a  number of human ocular/genital diseases.  in order to test for  infection by such organisms, reticulated body derived from  any immunotype strain of c.  trachomatis is utilized in a  micro-immunofluorescence testing, which allows the detecÂ­ tion of antibody to c.  trachomatis regardless of strain or  immunotype.  if anti-human igm is utilized in the fluorescent  conjugate it can be determined if the antibody is derived  from a human source of active infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
ifeunofluorescent test method and substance for use therein this invention relates to irnmunofluorescence test methods and to a substance for use therein. chlamydia trachomatis organisms are the etiological agents for a number of human ocular-genital diseases, such as ocular trachoma, lymphogranuloma venereum (lgv) and non-gonococcal urethritis (ngu). the most important of these diseases in the united states is ngu. the annual incidence of ngu exceeds that of gondrrhea and it is estimated that there occur more than 2,000,000 cases of ngu yearly in the united states alone. the most sensitive and specific serology of chlamydia trachomatis has been the indirect micro-immunofluorescence antibody test (micro-if) of wang and grayston (j. infect. dis 130 388 (1974)) , currently used in several major chlamydial research laboratories throughout the world. however, due to the difficulty of the test, it has not yet been incorporated as a diagnostic procedure in general clinical laboratories. the standard micro-if test requires inclusion of 15 c. trachomatis immunotype elementary body (eb) antigens. others have used a single immunotype strain with broad cross reactivity in the micro-if (thomas et al j. clin. microbiol. 4:6 (1976)). this latter approach has practical value because in many instances information of specific immunotypes is not required for diagnosis and treatment of chlamydial infections. unfortunately, no c. trachomatis strain cross-reacts a hundred per cent with all 15 c. trachomatis immunotypes. therefore, the usage of a single antigen has compromised the simplicity of the test in return for reduction in sensitivity. a different approach to this problem was taken by caldwell et al, u. s. patent no. 4,118,469 who isolated a single antigen common to all strains of c. trachomatis. this is used in the radioimmunoassay method. in the micro-if test, the use of a group specific antigen would make use ofan antibody's ability to crossraact with a broadly reacting antigen. technically, the micro-if requires the intact morphology or structure of the organism for identification of the immunofluorescent reaction. therefore, any procedure which alters or destroys the morphology of chlamydia cannot be used. however, if an intact form of the organism could be used which would be capable of providing broad cross-reactivity to antisera of all the immunotypes, this antigenic form should provide the sensitivity needed from a single test antigen. christophersen and manire (3. immunol. 103, 1085 (1969)), working with c. psittaci observed that the two developmental forms of chlamydiae, i.e., reticulated bodies (rbs) and elemental bodies (ebs) have distinct characteristics. rb is non-infectious and does not contain the characteristic chlamydial "toxins", eb is infectious and contains the "toxins". wang observed an exact correlation of the specificity of the mouse toxicity prevention test (wang, et al. 1963. classification of trachoma virus strains by protection of mice from toxic death. j. immunol. 90: 849-856.) and the micro-if (wang, et al. 1971. a micro immunofluorescence method. study of antibody response to tric organisms in mice, p. 273-288. in r.l. nichols (3d.), trachoma and related disorders caused by chlamydial agents. excerpta medica, amsterdam.). this observation indicated that the
