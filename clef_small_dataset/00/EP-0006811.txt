<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrolytic display cell comprising a transparent transparent electrode for the display, a metal counter-electrode, said first metal, an electrolyte interposed between said electrode and said counter-electrode and means for Power supply of said electrode and said counter-electrode to cause on certain parts of said electrode the deposition or dissolution of a metal layer formed from said first metal. This cell is characterized in that said counterlectrode further comprises a conducting material of electricity, inert chemically and electrochemically in the operating conditions of said cell, said material and said first metal being associated in said counter-electrode such as such as such as The first metal is in contact with the electrolyte and that said electricity conductive material forms a continuous film. Application to the display.
