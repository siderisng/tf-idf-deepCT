<ABSTRACT>
1.  a method for selective reactive ion etching of an element composed of a substrate coated with an insulating layer delineated according to a desired pattern, of the type comprising the step of : positioning the substrate on the cathode of a reactive ion etching system, said cathode being connected to an ac voltage source, and characterized in that it further comprises the step of introducing into said system a reactive etching gas consisting of gaseous fluorocarbon capable of supplying a sufficient amount of cf3 ions for the etching process and of a second gas, that is, hydrogen or a constituent capable of supplying hydrogen, selected from the group of nh4 and saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, wherein the amount of hydrogen represents at least 10% of the total mass flow rate in order to ensure etching of the insulating layer at a rate higher than that of the substrate on the one hand, and to avoid polymerization of said constituent capable of supplying hydrogen on the other hand.
