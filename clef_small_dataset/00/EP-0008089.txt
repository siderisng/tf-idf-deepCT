<ABSTRACT>
To create a high-resolution laser removal measuring device according to the pulse runtime method, a mode-coupled laser is used as a steering tube (1), which radiates high intensity extremely short impulses. In order to evaluate these short-term pulses on the receiving side, an optical correlation of the echo pulse is carried out with a reference pulse delayed in an optical runtime member (5) according to the term of the measuring pulse. For the optical corrugation, preferably, the two-photon absorption TPF fluorescent dye or method of frequency supply Double SHG optically non-linear crystals. In both cases, a secondary radiation of double frequency is triggered when the laser radiation is impacting, which lasts longer than the primary laser pulse temporally. As a result, it is possible to convert the secondary radiation in a photodetector (9) into one of the radiations corresponding to the optically non-linear element (8) only briefly to the optically non-linear element (8) and by changing the delay tion time of the reference beam in the runtime member (5) the maximum of the photocurrent Find. If this is achieved, the delay time of the reference beam corresponds to the term of the measure of the measure.
