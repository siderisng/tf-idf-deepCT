<ABSTRACT>
a device for teaching a patient to keep his lips closed, to  combat dribbling, has a sensor electrode (12, 22, 46) for  insertion between the lips, and an electrical detector (g1) and  indicator (30) to indicate cessation of contact with at least  one lip.  the patient is thus reminded to keep his lips closed.  in one form, there is a secondary electrode (26) attached  to a remote part of the patient's body, the detector detecting  when an electrical circuit through the body is broken by the  sensor electrode falling from the lips.  in another form, the  sensor electrode (46) is upwardly hooked (50) to contact the  upper lip, and the detector detects absence of electrical  contact between sensor electrode and a frame (32) hooked  behind the lower lip.
