<ABSTRACT>
In a fast-release device for spring storage brake cylinder, which connects the spring storage piston (17, 23) releasably with the piston rod (25), a damping device is connected to the clutch between the piston (17, 23) and the piston rod (25) which disengage the spring storage piston (17, 23) from the piston rod (25) the relative movement between the two dampens. As a coupling member, a transverse pin (29), which is fastened in a pivotable guide member (27) and to couple a transverse slot (49) in the piston tube (23) and a L-shaped slot in the piston rod (25). For damping the relative movement of guide member (27) and piston rod (25), two annular pistons (43, 45) are provided on the piston rod (25) which form a fluid-filled annular space in which a displacement body (37) is located. The sub-spaces on both sides of the displacement body (37) may be connected by throttle channels (41). If the coupling members are designed as a non-self-inhibited threaded threaded threaded spindle and coupling nut of a follow-up device, of which a member is durable via a switchable rotary coupling, the damping device can be formed as the rotary coupling bridging rotary damping device.
