<ABSTRACT>
aromatic polyethersulphones that are particularly useful  as adhesives and coatings having end groups of formula  -och₂cor, where r is alkyl or alkoxy.  preferred examples  are -och₂coch₃ and -och₂cooc₂h₅.  such polymers may  be made by heating polyethersulphones made from  halophenates or bisphenate/dihalide mixtures, in the presence  of a reagent of formula xch₂cor (x is halogen, preferably  chlorine), such as chloroacetone or ethyl chloroacetate,  for a short period of time.  such polymers of low molecular  weight (rv < 0. 25) are of particular use in coating compositions  comprising a dispersion of a fluorocarbon polymer dispersed  in a solution or dispersion of the polyethersulphone.
