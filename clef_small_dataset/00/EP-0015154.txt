<ABSTRACT>
bearing cups manufactured by deep-drawing and heat-­ treating sheet or strip steel having a higher carbon content  have good strength but the deep-drawing step is difficult to  carry out.  if a low carbon content steel is used, the deep-­ drawing becomes easier but the heat-treating step does not  produce a product having a satisfactorily high core strength.  the product is improved by using a sheet or strip steel  consisting of iron, carbon, boron, manganese, silicon,  aluminium and titanium.  the utilization of a low carbon con­ tent steel containing boron produces bearing cups having  good strength after the heat treatment step.  the utilization of  a higher carbon content steel containing boron produces  bearing cups having strengths superior to those made from  corresponding steels not containing boron and without  increased manufacturing difficulties.

description #'#tlt#od uf p#odur#ijt# rearing oups by deep d2a'..ttg'1 drawing" the present invention relates to a method of deep drawing steel bearing cups, for example, needle bearing cups. bearing cups nay be manufactured from a sheet or strip metal, for example a steel, utilizing a deepdrawing process to form the cup shape and a subsequent heat treatment step to give the formed cup the desired strength. however, when a sheet or stip steel is used to form the bearing cup, it is observed that the most suitable steel to give good formation on the cup press, utilized in the deep-drawing process, is not the most suitable steel at the heat treatment stage and vice versa. for example, if a steel from which most of the carbon has been removed is used, the deep-drawing of the cup becomes relatively easy but this loss of carbon would render the heat treatment process futile. a bearing cup would be produced that would have little or no resistance to pressure in service. conversely, if extra carbon is added to the steel, for example to raise the carbon content to a level of 0.2 ,6 by weight or more, or if appreciable amounts of alloying elements such as nickel and chromium are added, the effect upon the heat treatment process would be dramatic. a very strong bearing cup would be formed. unfortunately, apart from the higher cost of such a steel, it would be unsuitable for deep-drawing into precision bearing cups on the cup press due to a lack of flow properties. in practice, a compromise between the above two extremes has been used where sufficient carbon and alloying elements are added to a steel to give a reasonably strong in va the forbid cap after the heat treatment stage without rendering the drawability of the steel impract cable. for e7#ample, steels containing from 0.1 to 0.15%' by weight carbon, from 0.2 to 0.4/ó by weight nickel and from 0.2 to 0.4,¯0 by weight chromium have been utilized. a steel containing approximately 0.12%' by weight carbon, approximately 0.2?%, by weight nickel and approximately 0#)2%, by weight chromium may yield, on oil quenching, a bearing cup having a core strength of 52 to 60 tons/in2 (803 to 927 j'#a, mpa = mega pascals). although the drawability of the steels mentioned in the preceding paragraph is not rendered impracticable, it has been found that the steel must be lubricated during the deep-drawing stage in order to prevent cracking and to preserve the dimensional tolerance. such lubrication of the steel surface has been achieved by coating the steel, prior to deep-drawing, with copper or a phosphate or equivalent material. the necessity of providing a lubricant coating on the steel is a disadvantage because it increases the raw material costs and also the subsequent processing costs. the subsequent processing costs are increased since it is the practice, at present, to remove the lubricant coating before the heat treatment step. the necessity of providing a lubricant coating, e.g. a copper
