<ABSTRACT>
the cavity wall upright consists of a profiled section with two main flanges forming parallel supporting surfaces for the wall sections.  the flanges are joined together by a body whose central portion forms at least one stop face and one supporting face for one or more internal plates.  the supporting faces can be formed by stamping and folding portions of the body at regular intervals, while the unstamped portions of the body form the stop faces.  alternatively the plate supporting faces can be formed by folding over the outer flange edges towards the body and bending the latter parallel to the walls.  the stop is formed by a protrusion, thickened portion or kink in the body.
