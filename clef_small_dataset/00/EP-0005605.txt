<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to nestable drinking cups.  a cup (1) comprises a base (2) having an integral  peripheral upstanding wall (3) which together with the base  (2) forms a liquid reservoir.  the free end of the wall (3) is  turned over to form an outwardly and downwardly extending  collar (6) which extends circumjacent the upper part of  the upwardly extending portion of wall (3) and is spaced  therefrom.  the collar (6) is so constructed that when the  collar (6) is gripped by a user, it remains spaced from the  upwardly extending portion of the wall (3).  the collar (6) can  be provided with strengthening features such as ribs (7) or  an outwardly and downwardly inclined shoulder (13) or  combination of these two, to increase the rigidity of the  collar.  the construction of the cup provides a cup which is  comfortably and easily held by a user when it contains hot  beverages and which is also economic to manufacture.
