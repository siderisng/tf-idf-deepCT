<ABSTRACT>
the nitrogen and/or cyanuric acid value content of an  effluent is reduced by treating the effluent with a reagent  containing a halogen donor or nh₃ or nh₄⁺ respectively  so as to form a haloamine which decomposes to give off  nitrogen.  the cyanuric acid or salt thereof remaining in the  reaction mixture is recovered for reuse to leave an effluent  suitable for discharge to waste.  preferably, the effluent is  that from a cyanuric acid chlorination process and the nh₃  or nh₄⁺ is provided by an effluent and/or by-product scrub­ bing liquor from a cyanuric acid production process.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for treating an effluent containing cyanuric acid values the present invention relates to a process for treating an effluent containing cyanuric acid values, notably one from a cyanuric acid chlorination process. the production of cyanuric acid and/or chlorinated cyanuric acids gives rise to effluents which contain levels of nitrogen and cyanuric acid values which are too high to permit direct discharge of the effluents to waste. furthermore, the nitrogen and cyanuric acid values are valuable components which represent a cash loss when sinqiiy discharged to waste. it has been proposed to treat these effluents to render them suitable for discharge to waste or to recover some of the nitrogen values for use as fertilizers. however, such proposals have either not recovered the cyanuric acid values or have required the use of expensive treatment processes and chemicals. to date no simple and effective method exists for treating these effluents. we have now devised a simple process for treating an effluent containing cyanuric acid values. the term cyanuric acid values is used herein to denote collectively or individually cyanuric acid, isocyanuric acid, salts of these acids, halogenated derivatives of these acids and/or salts of these derivatives. accordingly, the present invention provides a process which comprises treating a first reagent containing a halogen donor with a second reagent containing nh3 and/or nh4+ ions, at least one of the reagents also providing cyanuric acid values, whereby there is formed a reaction mixture containing a haloamine; decomposing the haloamine to give off nitrogen whereby the nitrogen content of the reaction mixture is reduced; and recovering cyanuric acid or a salt thereof from the resultant mixture. the reagents for present use can be derived from a wide range of sources and at least one of the reagents is preferably an effluent from a process which uses or produces cyanuric acid, a halogenated cyanuric acid or a salt thereof. the invention is of especial use in treating the aqueous effluent from a cyanuric acid chlorination process. for convenience the invention will be described hereinafter with respect to this especially preferred use. the effluent from a cyanuric acid chlorination process is typically an aqueous medium containing 0.1 to 1.0t w/w chlorine, mainly as chlorinated cyanuric acids, and 5 to 10% w/w sodium chloride, and will usually be acidic. the chlorinated cyanuric acid in the aqueous nedium includes those of the general formula: emi2.1 and hydrates thereof or the enol forms thereof wherein x is chlorine; and m is selected from halogen, notably chlorine, hydrogen or an alkali-metal. it is preferred that at least one m be chlorine. suitable chlorinated cyanuric acids thus include di- or trichloroisocyanuric acids, monosodium dichioroisocyanurate, monopotassium dichloroisocyanurate; and hydrates thereof. mixtures of chlorinated cyanuric acids can be present in the aqueous medium. it is preferred that the effluent containing the chlorinated cyanuric acids has a high enough ph value, typically above 5, preferably 5 to 9, to reduce the rate of decomposition of the chlorinated cyanuric acid to an acceptable level, notably where
