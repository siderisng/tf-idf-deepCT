<ABSTRACT>
a plant for storing liquids at low temperature, with one or more heat insulated, single or double-walled storage tanks under ground.  in order to make the plant safe against explosions and fire while maintaining installation and maintenance costs low, the tank(-s) is located in a shaft (10) under a dome like concrete barrier (16) designed to resist an external shock wave pressure and provided with maintenance passages (17) which are protected against shock waves and flame penetration.

<DESCRIPTION>
explosion-proof plant for the storage of liquid gas the present invention relates to a plant for the storage of liquids at low temperatures, such as liquid natural gas, with at least one storage tank located in the sl-ourd. existing tanks for liquid gas, located in the ground, have roofs dimensioned for low internal pressures and for external load of wind and snow, etc. the roofs are formed of steel or are a thin shell of concrete standing on the tank wall. upon an explosion or a fire within or adjacent such a tank there is a large risk for the roof falling in, whereby the stcred liquid gas will vaporize and cause an expanding high-energy cloud of gas, causing further explcsions and fires, which may have a catastrophic influence on a terminal consisting of a group of tanks of conventional type located in t: ground. one object of the present invention is to provide a plant of the kind mentioned initially, which is protected against damages fror bomb and gas explosions, and against fire on and above the ground surface. specifically the invention aims to solve the problem to attain this object with measures causing a reasonable additional cost and not making the inspection and maintenance of the plant more difficult. according to the invention a plant for storing liquids at low temperature, particularly liquid natural gays, comprises at least one heat insulated, single or doublewalled storage tank of steel, metal or concrete located in a shaft of generally uniform cross section in the ground under a generally dome like concrete barrier designed to resist an external shock wave pressure from a bomb or exploding gas and provided with passages for air, personnel transports, electric cables, and tubes for gas and liquids and protected against shock waves and flame penetration. thus, according to the invention a fire and explosionproof storage plant is provided by means of a heat insulated, single or double-wall storage tank in a shaft in the ground and a barrier in the form of a concrete dome thereover. the dome should be designed so as to resist the pressure of about 1,5 to 5 mpa caused by a shock wave reflected against the dome from a gas exploding above the ground surface. in addition, this barrier is provided with shock wave proof passages required for the operation of the storage, which are formed so as to prevent also flame penetration and gas penetration. if necessary, the ground around the abutment of the barrier and the walls of the shaft are also sealed against shock waves and gas. the storage tank in a plant designed in this manner is simultaneously protected against bomb attacks. the invention will be described more closely below with reference to embodiments illustrated on the attached drawing, on which figures 1 and 2 are cross sections through one each of said embodiments. the same or similar details of the two embodiments have been provided with the same reference numerals on the drawing. figure 1
