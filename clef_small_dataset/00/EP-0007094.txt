<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a special method for producing a titanium component for polymerisa tion catalysts of the Ziegler-Natta type. Characteristic of the method according to the invention is that first (1) in a first stage (1. 1) is an alcoholate of the formula Mg (OR) ₂, wherein R represents a lower alkyl group, and (1. 2) a chlorotoluene of the formula wherein X represents chlorine or hydrogen, in a particular molar ratio in a spherical fluid mill under certain grinding conditions, in particular a relatively low temperature, in the absence of dilution coins with each other; then (2) in a second stage (2. 1) the substance resulting from step (1) with (2. 2) titanium trachloride in a certain volume ratio, which holds all under constant mixing for some time at elevated temperature and thereby Result the solid with separation excess titanium tetrach loride isolated; and finally (3) in a third stage (3. 1), the solid resulting from step (2) brings together again with (3. 2) titanium tetrachloride in a certain amount of permanent ratio, the whole under constant mixing again holds a while at an elevated temperature and the The resulting solid - as the new titanium component - isolated under separation of excess titrate trachloride. The new titanium component makes it possible to produce polymers of α-monoolefins not only in high prey but also with high isotacticity.
