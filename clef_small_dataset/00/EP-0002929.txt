<ABSTRACT>
molten steel is deoxidized while it is being tapped  into a receiving vessel by sequentially adding at least  three separate deoxidizing agents such as manganese,  silicon and aluminum in order of increasing deoxidizing  strength.  the additions are suitably spaced to allow each  to mix and react before the next addition is made.  the  resulting steel has superior magnetic properties.
