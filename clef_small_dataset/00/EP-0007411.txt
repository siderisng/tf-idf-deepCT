<ABSTRACT>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION: Filling machines industries. Mechanism consisting of a lever (10) formed of two arms (10a, 10b) arranged on either side of a fixed axis of articulation (x, x). on the end of the first arm (10a) is supported by the end of a movable rod (13) in axial translation verti rotation cord of said arm, terminated at the other end by a loader tray (4 ) Descending as the load increases. The end of the second arm (10b), formed of two parts (10b, 10c) articulated on a movable axis carries a counterweight (19) sliding on the artiol part on the fixed axis, and can slide itself along a reclining rectilinear ramp (20). By choosing suitably both the weight of the counterweight and the inclination of the rectilinear ramp, the lever is balanced at a time in two positions corresponding one to the absence of charge on the tray, and the other at a Predetermined value charge on the tray, the equilibrium being substantially reached in the intermediate positions. Application: Bulk products dosage spilled in containers per filling machines.
