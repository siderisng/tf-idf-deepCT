<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method are disclosed for spiral separation  of materials.  the apparatus includes spiral separator  flights mounted on a vertical tube (22) within an enclosure  with the material, such as seeds, to be separated being introduced  into the apparatus through the vertical tube upon  which the spirals are mounted.  one of the separated material  fractions is discharged from the apparatus through the vertical  tube while the other fraction is discharged from a second  discharge outlet.  a spiral driving mechanism (42) and a baffle  (44) are provided for separator adjustability and a plurality  of spirals may be enclosed within a common housing.  the  method includes separating materials by introducing the  materials onto spirals at a separating area, controlling the  speed of rotation of the spirals to control separation, and  collecting the separated fractions
