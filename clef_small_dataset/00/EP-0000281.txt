<ABSTRACT>
a frame for supporting implements (18, 20) on a vehicle  with a chassis including a transversely extending axle housing  (110).  the frame includes a pair of longitudinally extending  rails (58), each rail having first and second end portions  and a tower structure (54) extending upwardly from a location  intermediate the end portions.  first interconnecting  means (56) interconnect and maintain the first end portions  of the rails in a fixed transversely spaced apart relation, the  second end portions being arranged to be secured to second  interconnecting means such as a counterweight (118) or backhoe  structure (40) to maintain said second end portions in a  fixed transversely spaced relation.  means (92, 96) are provided  for connecting the first end portions to the vehicle  chassis and a stabilizing means (128) extends between the  tower structures which permits constrained movement of  the tower structures so that the rails can deflect under torsional  loading.  attachment means (98) are also provided for  attaching each rail to the axle housing (110) intermediate the  ends of the rail.
