<ABSTRACT>
complete solubilization of fire retardant additives in  polymers leads to minimization of the impact of the presence  of the additive on the physical properties of the polymer.  the  invention provides additive combinations comprising a fire  retardant additive that have a combined solubilization temp­ erature in a given polymer that allows more complete sol­ ubilization and/or a shorter residence time at solubilization  temperatures, than would be accessible with the fire retar­ dant additive alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
fire retardant polymers and a process for producing such polymers this invention relates tc fire retardant polymer compositions and specifically compositions comprising a blend of additives chosen to optimize both the efficiency of the fire retardant and the physical properties of the polymer. it is known that the incorporation of fire retardant additives tends to diminish markedly certain of the physical properties of the polymer into which it is incorporated. a particularly serious problem arises with the multi-axial impact strength of the polymer which can be very adversely affected by the presence of additives the effect is documented for example in the book "toughened plastics by c. b. bucknall (applied science, london, 1977). it has now been found that a correlation exists between the extent to which the additive becomes solubilizer in the polymer and the retention of the physical properties of the polymer. this correlation is illustrated in example 1 below. this discovery was made possible by the application of thermal optical analysis to determine the extent to which an additive is solubilized in the polymer. the technique, which is described in the book "macromolecules in solution" by h. morawetz (wiley. new york, 1975), utilizes equiprnefl comprising a hot stage microscope, a photo voltmeter anc a dupont 990 read-out instrument. in practice, a beam of mon@- chromatic light is passed through a sample of a polymer incorporating the additive. the fraction of the light tran@- mitted by the sample is monitored against temperature. typically the transmission will start off at a low value 3- substantially maintain that value as the temperature rlss until a point at which the light transmission begins t .-- - sharply to a much higher level which is maintained there@@@ the point at which the sharp rise begins is the solubil@@@ temperature, ts, of the additive in the polymer. the @ is illustrated in the graph of percent light transmisale; ; against temperature that appears as figure 1 which in ix fully desc-,ec @@ example 1 below note that upon cooling the percents nt transmission does not fall substantially indicating that virtually all the additive remains dissolved. complete solubilization is not immediately reached at ts but over a period the length of which depends on the amount by which ts is exceeded. ts marks the lowest temperature at which solubilization can be achieved. ts is dependent on the polymer, the additive and the amount of additive used. certain additives in certain polymers show the above effect but upon cooling, the light transmission falls indicating increasing re-separation. for the purposes of this specification such an effect is not regarded as "solubilization" which is herein used to indicate a stable state not affected by subsequent temperature variations. clearly the effect on physical properties is not a major factor where very small amounts of additive are used. thus additives such as anti-static additives, w\t stabilizers and antioxidants which are usually employed in amounts of up to one percent are not those where solubilization is a critical factor in
