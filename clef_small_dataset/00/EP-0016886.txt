<ABSTRACT>
an electrical control device has a joystick or lever (40)  manually movable in the x and y directions to actuate a pair of  electrical components (22, 24) having respective rotatable  shafts (26).  the controller (10) includes a housing (12) having a  top cover (14) provided with an opening (16) through which the  lever (40) extends.  the lower end of the lever (40) is pivotally  mounted in a socket (20) on the bottom (18) of the housing  (12) and a ball joint (42) is carried by the lever (40) intermediate  its ends.  the ball joint (42) is pivotally coupled to a control  plate (30) shiftable in the housing (12) beneath the top cover  (14), the plate (30) being biased into an equilibrium position by  a number of leaf springs (36) normally engaging respective  side margins of the plate (30).  the plate (30) has a pair of slots (58, 60) in its lower sur足 face, the slots (58, 60) being mutually perpendicular, and verti足 cal projections (56) on the outer ends of a pair of bell cranks  (50) are shiftably received within respective slots (58, 60) in the  plate (30).  the bell cranks (50) are coupled to the rotatable  shafts (26) of respective electrical components (22, 24) so  that, when the plate (30) is moved in any one of a number of dif足 ferent directions upon manual movement of the lever (40), one  or both of the rotatable shafts (26) of the electrical compo足 nents (22, 24) are rotated to actuate the components (22, 24).
