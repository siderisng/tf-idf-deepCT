<ABSTRACT>
in accordance with the present invention, there is  provided herein improved glass fiber dispersions for making  uniform glass fiber mats by the wet-laid process.  the well  dispersed glass fiber compositions of this invention usually  are prepared by mixing chopped glass fibers in water with  a small amount of a select group of cationic quaternary  ammonium compounds which have at least two long chain  groups as part of the molecule.  as features of the invention,  the dispersions may be formed at relatively high glass  fiber consistencies, in neutral or slightly alkaline solutions,  and without generation of a high degree of foams.  the  resultant dispersions then are used to make very high  quality glass fiber mats at high rates of production.
