<ABSTRACT>
substituted 3-(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)indoles of the formula:    wherein r¹ is hydrogen or lower alkyl;   r² is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl,  adamantyl, or a phenyl or benzyl group in which  the benzene ring is optionally mono-substituted  with halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy  or trifluoromethyl;   r³ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, allyl, 3-methyl-allyl,  lower cycloalkyl-methyl, lower cycloalkyl-ethyl,  lower alkoxy- lower alkyl, di(lower alkyl)amino-lower  alkyl, lower alkanoyl, lower cycloalkyl-carbonyl,  or a benzyl or benzoyl group in which  the benzene ring is optionally substituted as in  r²;   and r⁴ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen,  hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, di(lower alkyl)amino, or  a benzyloxy group in which the benzene ring is  optionally substituted as in r²;   are described which are selective inhibitors of the action of the  thromboxane synthetase enzyme, but which do not significantly  affect the actions of the prostacyclin synthetase or  cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, and which are therefore useful in  the treatment of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, transient  ischaemic attack and migraine.  all the compounds, except  that in which r¹, r², r³ and r⁴ are each hydrogen, are novel.   methods for their preparation are also described.
