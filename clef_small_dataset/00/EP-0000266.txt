<ABSTRACT>
a fluid expandable drum for building portions of tires m  a tire building machine includes an annular supporting drum  (12) and an expandable annular tube element (10) having an  inner peripheral surface supported on the annular drum.  the  tube element includes an outer peripheral surface upon  which support means (40) is secured for movement therewith.   a plurality of shoe members (36) are connected 52, 42)  to the support means for movement therewith with the shoe  members definding an annular building surface (38) thereon  which is movable in a radial direction toward and away from  the annular support drum upon contraction and expansion,  respectively, of the tube element.  the tube element is  expanded to expand the diameter of the building surface to  enable to tire portion to be built thereon and retracted to  decrease the diameter of the building surface to enable a  built tire portion to be removed therefrom.
