<ABSTRACT>
compounds of formula:    wherein r¹ is halogen or c₁₋₃ alkyl;  r² is -o-, -s-   --or    r³ is c₁₋₅ alkyl, c₃₋₅ alkenyl containing no α,β-­ unsaturation, c₁₋₅ haloalkyl, c₄₋₈ cycloalkyl, c₂₋₅ alkoxyalkyl  or is phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, c₁₋₃ haloalkyl  or haloalkoxy, c₁₋₃ alkyl or methoxy;   r⁴ and r⁵ are the same or different groups selected from  hydrogen, halogen, methyl or methoxy;   m and n are the same or different arid can each represent  0 or 1;   x is oxygen or sulfur; and   the nitrogen to pyridine bond is at the 2- or 3-position of  the pyridine ring;   provided that:   (a) both of r⁴ and r⁵ cannot be hydrogen and when one  of r⁴ and r⁵ is hydrogen the other is chloro and r³ is phenyl  substituted by a trifluoromethyl group;   (b) when the nitrogen to pyridine bond is at the  2-position the r²-(ch₂)n-r³ group is at the 5-position; and   (c) when the nitrogen to pyridine bond is at the  3-position the r²-(ch₂)nr³ group is at the 6-position;   and the acid-addition salts or n-oxide thereof have been  found useful as insecticides.  the compounds are prepared by the reaction of a ben­ zoyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate with an amnopyridine.
