<ABSTRACT>
a multi-mode electronic wind turbine control system  establishes a reference blade angle br for a two-bladed, hori­ zontal axis, variable pitch wind turbine rotor, the blade angle  being regulated by a hydraulic pitch change mechanism (38).   the rotor (10), via appropriate shafts and a gearbox (20), is  coupled to a synchronous generator (24) to produce electrical  energy which is fed to a power utility grid.  the control system  (36) provides closed loop pitch control for rotor acceleration  rate during start-up, for rotor deceleration rate during shut-­ down, for speed control when the synchronous generator is  off-line, and for power control when the synchronous  generator is on-line.  a single control integrator is used for all  closed loop operating modes, with a rate limiter circuit in front  of the control integrator to prevent integrator overtravel.  the  integrator has maximum and minimum blade angle stops, the  minimum stop being variable as a function of rotor speed and  wind speed.  when on-line, power control is provided by a  unique shaft torque control using proportional plus integral  plus derivative controls in combination.
