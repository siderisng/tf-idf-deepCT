<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for colouring the peripheral edge portion  of lenses (7) for spectacles comprising: at least a basket (1)  constituted of two side members (12a, 12b) connected to  one another by cross bars and carrying longitudinal shafts  (17) spaced aparts from each other of a distance less than the  lens diameter and provided with annular shaped grooves  (17a) adapted to receive portions of the peripheral edges of  the lenses; means to cause the shafts (17) to rotate in pairs in  the same direction with predetermined adjustable speeds; a  tank (2) associated with heating and stirring means and con­ taining the dye bath (3); and means for obtaining to and from  movements between the basket (1) and the bath (3) of a pre­ determined, but adjustable value, so as to obtain that the  edges of the lenses (7) during their revolving motion about  their axes, are dipped into the bath for a predetermined  depth.
