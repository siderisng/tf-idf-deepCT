<ABSTRACT>
the gear train includes a final output shaft (30) and a low  range and output gear train component (3, 4) including two  three-element differential devices (s₄, p₄, r₄; s₃, p₃, r₃), and  a brake (i) and connections to a first intermediate output  shaft (20) and an additional range shaft (48) for receiving  inputs.  the brake (i) being operable to provide a distinct first  gear range.  a first gear train component (2) is connected to  two input shafts (10, 16) for receiving two different rotational  input movements (at s₂ and r₂) and for mixing those two  movements to provide a third movement (at c₂) which is a  weighted sum of the two input movements to drive first (20)  and third (26) intermediate output shafts.  the first gear train  component (2) is connected for driving a second intermediate  output shaft (24) with an output directly proportional to  an input movement.  an additional range gear train component  (5, 6) associated with the second and third intermediate  output shafts (24, 26) including an additional range shaft (48)  which comprises the carrier shaft (c₄).  the additional range  gear train (5, 6) contains differential (s₅, c₅, r₅), clutch (iii)  and brake (ii) means for causing the additional range shaft  (48), selectively, to turn at a speed that is proportional to one  of the two outputs of the first gear train component, to turn at  a speed which is a weighted sum of those said two outputs  or to idle; and selective engagement of the clutch (iii) and  brake (ii) means of the additional range gear train component  (5, 6) causing the final output shaft (30) to be driven in  either of two additional distinct forward ranges which are  each functions of the third movement and the speed of the  additional range shaft.  all shafts are concentric with output  shaft 30.
