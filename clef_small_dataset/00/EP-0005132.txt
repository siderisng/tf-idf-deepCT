<ABSTRACT>
an aspirator for air sampling, the air samples being  sucked into a glass vessel for a certain period of time.  the  aspirator can be carried in a pocket, for example, by the one  whose working environment is being analyzed.  in a casing  there is disposed a replaceable cylinder (2) with associated  plunger (4).  the plunger is intended to be pulled in by a  motor unit (12) and gearbox, arranged adjacent the cylinder  (2), the unit (12) rotating a drum (8) onto which is wound a  string.  the other string end is fixed, via a pulley (7), to the  spring-loaded plunger (4).  when air has been sucked in to a  sufficient amount, the opening (3) of the cylinder (2) is closed  and the plunger (4) can be released from the string and the  spring, which is possible since the plunger (4) is only  magnetically retained.
