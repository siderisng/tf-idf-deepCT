<ABSTRACT>
a detergent product comprises a bag formed partly or  wholly of polypropylene fibres, and containing a particulate  detergent composition.  polypropylene does not degenerate  on storage as do cellulose fibres.  the detergent composition  may be fully formulated composition, particularly containing  a bleach, and or other fabric treatment materials.  the bag  may be formed by heat-sealing.  one or more seals may be  water-soluble or mechanically weak to enable the bag to burst  open in the washing machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
detergent products technical field the invention relates to detergent products which are suitable for treating fabric in a washing machine and which contain detergent compositions in particulate form. background at?t although the marketing of powdered detergent compositions packaged in cartons is common practice, this imposes constraints both on their formulation and methods of production. for example the powders must be free flowing and have an attractive appearance to the comsumer, and the ingredients should not segregate during transport and storage. the products must also:be safe, both for contact with the skin and in the event of accidental ingestion; in particular, the compositions should not contain too high a level of alkaline although alkalinity is beneficial for detergent properties when using washing machines which have a rotating drum in which the fabrics are placed, there can also be substantial losses of conventionally dosed detergent powder by retention in the dispenser and by its accuinulation in the dead spaces beneath the drllm, such as the drain hose it has been proposed previously to market powdered detergent compositions in packages each of which contains suitable amounts of the detergent powders for individual washes order normal washing conditions. in particular, from united states patent specification-no 3 198 740 the detergent powders can be contained within bags of watersoluble materials such as soluble pox vinyl alcohol, but such packages have not yet met with much commercial success. one of f reasons for this is believed to be the high cost of pa^ -ging the detergent powders in this way which has outweighed the increased convenience in using the products. british patent specification no 961 821 discloses a package for chemicals such as bleaching powder, soaps or detergents, the package material being formed of a vented film such as polypropylene. canadian patent specification no 901 244 described a water-soluble bag for insecticides, the bag being reinforced with a polypropylene net. we have now found that improved bags can be made by using polypropylene fibres. disclosure of tbe invention accordingly, the present invention provides a detergent product which comprises a particulate detergent composition contained within a water-insoluble, but water-permeable bag which is constructed of sheet material containing at least a minor proportion of polypropylene fibres. a mayor advantage of the use of a.proportion of polypropylene fibres is that they facilitate making the bags by heat-sealing methods, which are convenient for large scale manufacture, and yet the polypropylene is relatively cheap to use, compared with other heat-sealing methods and the fibres are strong and cari be made in fine denier sizes to make suitable porous sheet materials. in addition, the polypropylene fibres have a major advantage in being chemically stably and, by using a relatively high proportion of such fibres in the material from which the bags are formed, it is possible to include in the detergent compositions ingredients which could. not be packed in conventional bags of cellulosic fibres, for example bleaching agents such as sodium perborate or trichlorocyanuric acid. best mode of carrying out ventioi; preferably
