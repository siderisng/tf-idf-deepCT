<ABSTRACT>
this application discloses a liquid soap dispensing system  including a closed soap container having a manually  actuated dispensing pump carried therebeneath.  refill of the  container is by a plastic refill squeeze bottle with a neck (155)  defining an outlet opening closed by a membrane (173)  recessed therein.  one embodiment of the bottle is formed by  ultrasonically welding in the neck end, after the bottle is filled,  a plug defining a cylindrical sleeve (165) closed at the  inner end thereof by a closure wall (173).  the neck is inserted  into a well (125) in the top (121) of the container, and a hollow  piercing member (130) at the bottom of the well (125)  ruptures the membrane or closure member (173), whereupon  soap may be squeezed from the bottle and through the  passage through the hollow piercing member (130), which is  constricted by septa (135, 136) dividing the passage into  channels such that flow of liquid soap therethrough at equal  pressures at both ends of the passage is substantially inhibited.   the piercing member (130) is in sealing engagement  with the plug sleeve (165), and annular ribs (158) on the neck  (155) are in sealing engagement with the well side wall.
