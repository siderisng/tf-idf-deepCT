<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polyurethane solutions or -Di trensions, methods for their preparation and their use. These polyurethane solutions or dispersions consist of substantially 30 to 80 percent by weight of at least one solution with TELS or dispersant and 70 to 20 percent by weight of a reaction product of from 80 to 10 weight percent of at least one hydroxyl group pen-containing polyester or polyethers having a hydroxyl number above 20 and 5 to 60% by weight of at least one hydroxyl compound with an acetylene and / or vinyl group and 10 to 70 weight percent of a Di- and / or polyisocy anat. Their preparation takes place in organic solvent, which is optionally removed after addition of dispersant holding water of water. The polyurethane solutions or dispersions of the present invention are suitable for the production of flat coatings, for painting wires, as multilayer adhesives and for the production of powder coatings.
