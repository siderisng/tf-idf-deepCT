<ABSTRACT>
a method for forming channels of high fluid conductivity  in relatively soft acid-soluble formation parts around a  bore-hole penetrating such formation, said method comprising  the sequential steps of:   1) installing a casing in the well, and introducing in the wall  of the casing a plurality of perforations arranged over at  least part of the said wall where facing the formation;   2) inducing in the formation a fracture communicating with  the perforations and containing a viscous fluid;   3) injecting an acid solution through the perforations into  the fracture at a pressure at which the fracture remains  open, the viscosity ratio between the viscous fluid and  the acid solution being chosen such that the viscous fluid  is displaced in the fracture in an unstable manner by the  acid solution;   4) continuing the injection of the acid solution through the  perforations until channels have been etched in areas of  the fracture walls that face each other;   5) injecting a viscous carrying fluid carrying a propping  agent through the perforations into the fracture at a  pressure at which the fracture remains open, the viscosity  of the carrying fluid being at least equal to the  viscosity of the acid solution;   6) continuing the injection of the carrying fluid and the  propping agent until propping agent is present in the  fracture between at least part of those areas of the  fracture walls wherein channels have been etched;   7) lowering the fluid pressure in the fracture, thereby  allowing the fracture walls to be displaced to closing  position, in which position the walls of the channels are  supported by propping agent; and   8) lowering the viscosity of the viscous fluids.
