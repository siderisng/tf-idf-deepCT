<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a process for pro­ ducing methacrylic acid by oxidizing methacrolein in va­ por phase with molecular oxygen or a gas containing  molecular oxygen, characterized in that the oxidation is  carried out in the presence of a catalyst having a com­ position shown by the following formula:   moavbpcxdyoef   wherein mo, v, p and o respectively represent molyb­ denum, vanadium, phosphorus and oxygen; x represents  at least one element selected from the group consisting  of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium; y represents  at least one element selected from the group consisting  of copper, silver, tin, thorium, germanium, nickel, iron,  cobalt, titanium, rhenium, chromium, cerium, antimony  and magnesium; and a, b, c, d, e and f denote the atomic  ratio of respective elements where a is 10, b is a number  of 6 or less than 6 excluding 0, preferably 0. 5 to 3, c is a  number of 0. 5 to 6, preferably 0. 5 to 3, d is a number of  0. 5 or less than 0. 5 excluding 0, preferably 0. 01 to 0. 3, e  is a number of 5 or less than 5 excluding 0, preferably  0. 01 to 1 and f is a number determined by the valence  and atomic ratio of the other elements and usually is a  number of 35 to 80, and comprising heteropolyacid hav­ ing the elements above-mentioned as its components and  x-metal salt of the heteropolyacid both of which are pre­ sent in a mixed state, and relates also to the above-­ mentioned catalyst.
