<ABSTRACT>
display installation with flaps that drop downwards which are supported on the circumference of parallel coaxial discs (1) and which can be viewed in turn by rotating the discs.  the flaps have webs (7), with which they can be supported in holes (6) in the discs, these webs being formed by cutouts near an edge of the flaps and being capable of insertion in the holes through slots (9) provided on the edge of the discs.  annular closing devices (11, 13), which can be rotated coaxially with respect to the disc (1), are provided for the slots (9), in order to allow flaps that are as thin as possible to be used.  <image>   <image>
