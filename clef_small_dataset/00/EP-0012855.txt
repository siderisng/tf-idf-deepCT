<ABSTRACT>
an imaging element which relies upon an aromatic dial­ dehyde to produce a dye provides improved maximum  neutral densities when certain polymers are superimposed  over the element.  such polymers seal the element to reduce  loss of the dialdehyde during development.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
overcoated photothermographic element having a dye-precursor retaining layer this invention relates to an imaging element which contains an aromatic dialdehyde as a dye-forming component of a radiation-responsive image-forming composition. more specifically, an element is provided which includes a layer of a polymer that seals the dialdehyde into the element as a means of increasing the maximum neutral densities available from the imaging element. imaging elements have been devised which rely upon the photo destruction of o-phthalaldehyde which, where not destroyed, forms a dye when suitably developed. examples are disclosed in u.s. patent no. 3,102,811 wherein poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and poly(vinyl alcohol) are listed as exemplary binders for an o-phthalaldehyde image-forming composition. o-phthalaldehyde is also used as a dye-forming material in imaging elements which rely upon the reduction of cobalt (ii) complexes, as described in research disclosure, vol. 158, june, 1977, publicàtion no. 15874, published by industrial opportunities ltd. hampshire, united kingdom. such imaging elements are susceptible to loss of phthalaldehyde during element formation, due to the high volatility of the compound. such losses can decrease drastically the amount of dye density available during development. one solution to this problem is to use a polysulfonamide as a binder for the imageforming composition. the polysulfonamide binder is useful to retain phthalaldehyde in the element. particularly useful polysulfonamide binders which provide superior levels of retention are described in u.s. patent no. 4,107,155 by fletcher et al, granted august 15, 1978. although the binders described in the aforesaid patent greatly increase the available dye density in elements using phthalaldehyde as the dye-forming material, some phthalaldehyde is still lost by volatilization during image processing. particularly, losses occur when the exposed element is heated for image development, therefore, it is desirable to provide such an element which better retains phthalaldehyde. now, it has been discovered that phthalaldehyde is more effectively retained, as a dye-forming material, in an imaging element when the element is overcoated with a layer of certain polymeric materials, more specifically, the present invention is an imaging element comprising a support bearing at least one layer of a radiation-sensitive image-forming composition containing an aromatic ortho-dialdehyde as a dyeforming component, characterized in that superimposed over said layer of image-forming composition there is a layer of a compatible polymeric material selected from gelatin, gelatin grafted with recurring units of acrylonitrile and bisacrylamidoacetic acid, or a polymer, or copolymer having at least 50 percent by weight of recurring acrylamide units. by "compatible" is meant a polymeric material having other physical properties appropriate to an imaging element, e.g., sufficient adhesion to the radiation-sensitive underlayer, transparency to activating radiation, and freedom from cracking. an overcoat layer of an imaging element according to the present invention is prepared preferably by coating a solution at a ph of 3 and containing 20 milligrams per square decimeter of a compatible polymer as described above. on exposure for 5 seconds to a 400 watt medium-pressure mercury arc lamp and heat development for 5 seconds at 1300 c, an imaging element of this invention produces an
