<ABSTRACT>
selected circumferential and axial profiles are formed  simultaneously on a rotating workpiece by apparatus that  comprises a carrier (34) that is mounted for movement  toward and away from the workpiece and carries a cutting  element (92) which is pushed by a spring (102) into engagement  with the workpiece.  the carrier (34) simultaneously follows  a circumferential cam (112) that rotates conjointly with  the workpiece and an axial cam (82) that is mounted on a  follower bar (70).  the follower bar (70) is mounted on the  carrier (34) for movement relative to the carrier solely along  an axis parallel to and spaced from the axis of rotation of the  workpiece.  the axial cam (82) and follower (94) are in series  relation to the circumferential cam (112) and follower (110)  so that movements of the cutting element (92) toward and  away from the workpiece generated by the tracking by the  follower bar (70) of the circumferential cam (112) are  superimposed on movements of the carrier (34) toward or  away from the workpiece generated by the tracking of the  axial cam (82) by the carrier (34) as the carrier (34) and the  cutting element (92) thereon move parallel to the axis of rotation  of the workpiece.
