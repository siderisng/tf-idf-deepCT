<ABSTRACT>
the long extending felt tip for the pen may be fed with ink by capillary action.  the writing device can be clamped to the open end of a sleeve-like writing device carrier using tensioning jaws.  the tensioning jaws themselves are pressed together by screw-on cover nut and conical surfaces which enclose the writing device and which are supported against the writing device carrier.  at least four tension jaws (6, 7, 8) are sections of a holding link (3) made in one piece in which the slots between the tensioning jaws extend only over a part of the whole length of the holding link.
