<ABSTRACT>
it has already been suggested that chronic exposure of  humans to nitrous oxide is a potential health hazard.  there is  especial concern for those working in the vicinity of a patient  to whom nitrous oxide is administered as an anaesthetic.   the present invention provides a disposable surgical mask  characterised in that a layer comprising particles of a  molecular sieve based on silicon dioxide and having an  affinity for nitrous oxide is disposed between adjacent layers  of the mask.  wearing such a mask reduces personal  exposure to nitrous oxide.
