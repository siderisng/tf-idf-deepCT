<ABSTRACT>
The piping clutch has a muffle part (2) and a sliding plug-in nipple (4) for connection z. b. a compressed air hose to a fixed supply line. The insertion of the plug-in pel is possible without an additional operation of the muffle part by hand, since the locking is carried out by spring-loaded Rie gelassane (46) which engage in a circumferential groove, (12) of the plug nipples (4). With completely uncoupled plug nipple, a valve (24) arranged in the muffle part (2) is opened against the pressure of a spring (26). The release of the clutch is carried out by two oppositely directed sliding movements of a sliding sleeve (58) encompassing the muffle part, wherein after a first sliding amount, the spring-loaded latching organs (46) are released and second latchor gane (66) after a second sliding movement. Between both unlocking stages, the plug-in nipple (4) performs a short axial movement, which leads to the closing of the valve (24) and for relaxing in the hose line of existing compressed air, so that the hose line after releasing the second locking (66) without danger with the Cut nipple from the muffle part can be removed. A resilient locking member (62) prevents unintentional reciprocation of the sliding sleeve (58).
