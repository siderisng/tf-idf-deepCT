<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for lateral deflection of certain articles selected according to a feature (eg. Bottles) from a first movement path (12) to a second movement path (14) has a plurality of deflection devices arranged side by side (18a-i).The coils no directions (18a-i) together form a deflection surface and are stationary in the direction of movement of the pollening articles.The pollening articles are deflected by the deflection devices (18a-i) step by the first movement path (12) to the second movement web (14), each deflecting device deflecting each pollening article by a partial amount laterally.The device operates reliably even with spatially and timely consecutive objects and at high speed.
