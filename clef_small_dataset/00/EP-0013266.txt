<ABSTRACT>
a double acting manual override mechanism for the hyd足 raulic actuator of a subsea gate valve, and a visual indicator  device for indicating the gate (28) position.  the gate (28) is  normally held open by hydraulic pressure and is moved by a  spring (78, 80) to a fail closed posiion in the event of a malfunc足 tion.  the override includes a drive nut thereaded onto the  valve stem (42) and a drive sleeve (90) which is telescoped on  the drive nut (88) and connected therewith by a series of  spines (88a).  spaced apart abutment (96 and 92a) surfaces  are provided on the sleeve (90) to limit axial movement of the  drive nut (88) on the valve stem (42) in both directions.  rota足 tion of the sleeve (90) by means of an adapter is translated into  rotation of the drive nut (88) which contacts one of the abut足 ments surfaces and thereafter affects axial movement of the  valve stem (42) to open or close the gate (28).  the indicator  device includes a watertight, transparent housing (118) within  which an indicator disc (144) moves in response to movement  of the gate (28).
