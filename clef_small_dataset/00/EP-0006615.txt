<DESCRIPTION>
process for preparing epihalohydrin enantiomers and intermediates background of the invention he present invention is concerned with processes for preparing epihalohydrin enantiomers and intermediates. zpibormohydrin enantiomers have been prepared by a resolution process - and an epichlorohydrin enantiomer has been prepared from 1-brcmo-3- chlorpropan-2-ol. enantiomer derived from the epibromohydrin [chemische berichte 48, 1862-184, (1915)j. an improved method for preparing the epihalohydrin enantiomers from sulfonyloxyhaloalcohol has been discovered - and an improved process for preparing an intermediate useful in the synthesis has also been discovered. summary of the invention: process for (a) preparing (s) or (rj epihalohydrin from an (s) or (r) sulfonyloxyhaloalcohol and (b) preparing (s) glycerol-l, 2-acetonide from isopropylidine-d-mannitol. description of the preferred embodiments: an embodiment of the present invention is a process for preparing an enantiomer of epihalohydrin which comprises treating an enantiomer of an alcohol having the formula emi1.1 wherein z is phenyl, monosubstitued phenyl, cf3 or c1-c6 alkyl and x is cl or br with an alkali metal glycolate and recovering said epihalohydrin by distillation. the reaction is illustrated by the following emi2.1 the product as recovered in good yield by direct vacuum distillation at room temperature from the reaction mixture. z may be phenyl, monosubstituted phenyl or c1-c6 alkyl. the monosubstituted phenyl group is exemplified by cl-c3-alkylphenyl e.g. p-propylphenyl, o-methylphenyl, and m-ethylphenyl, p-n02-phenyl, p-och3-phenyl, 2-chlorophenyl and the like. the c1-c6 alkyl group includes ch3, c(ch3)3, isopropyl, n-hexyl and the like. the p methyiphenyl and ch3 groups are preferred. the alkali metal glycolate includes k or na ethylene glycolate, with naethylene glycolate being preferred. when a more conventional low boiling solvent/ strong base, e.g. methanol/naoch3 is used in place of the glycolate in reaction the product yield obtained on direct vacuum distillation at room temperature is low. another embodiment of the present invention is a process for preparing (s)-glycerol-l, 2-acetonide of the formula emi2.2 which comprises a (a) treating 1,2:5,6-di-0- isopro- pylidine-d-mannitol having the formula emi3.1 with lead tetraacetate in a suitable solvent and (b) reducing the reaction product from (a) with alkalimetal borohydride and (c) treating the reaction mixture from (b) with an ammonium halide. suitable solvents include aprotic compounds such as tetrahydrofuron (thf), ethylacetate, dimethylformamide (dmf) and the like. thf and ethylacetate are preferred solvents. ammonium halides include ne4br and nh4c1. nh4c1 is preferred. the reaction of (b) with pb(oac)4 in step (a) may be carried out at any convenient temperature. temperatures below about 10-c are preferred. the preferred molar nature of leadtetraacetate to (b) is about 1:1. the reduction of the step (b) is also carried out at a convenient temperature. preferred temperatures are below about 10-c. the nabh4 reducing agent is generally added to the reaction mixture in solution e.g. in aqueous naoh. the amount of nabh4 may be varied. it is preferred that about 2 moles of nabh4 per mole of (b) reactant be used. the reaction of step (b) is allowed to proceed for a period sufficient for the reaction to be complete, e.g. for about 30 minutes at about
