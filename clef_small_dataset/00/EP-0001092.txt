<ABSTRACT>
hydroxyl-terminated liquid polymers having an aliphatic  polymeric backbone and sulfide linkages near the terminal  portions of the polymer molecule are prepared by polymerizing  (1) at least one vinylidene monomer having at least one  terminal châ‚‚=c< group per monomer molecule, together  with (2) a mixture of at least one hydroxyl-containing disulfide  and at least one hydroxyl-containing trisulfide.  use of the  above disulfide-trisulfide mixture permits viscosity control  during polymerization with substantially less disulfide  required than if the disulfide alone were used, and the resulting  polymers have less odor and discolor less upon heating  than if the disulfide alone were used.
