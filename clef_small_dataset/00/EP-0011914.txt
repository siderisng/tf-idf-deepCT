<ABSTRACT>
a titanium trichloride catalyst component containing a  minor amount of prepolymerized alpha-olefins is produced  by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminium  compound at low temperatures and them treating the result­ ing reduced solids product with about 1 to 1,000 wt.  % alpha-­ olefin so as to obtain a prepolymerized titanium trichloride  reduced solid.  the product so formed can thereafter be acti­ vated by treating with a hologenated hydrocarbon and a  lewis base complexing agent or titanium tetrachlorlde and a  lewis base complexing agent.
