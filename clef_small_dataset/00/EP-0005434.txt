<ABSTRACT>
1.  insert-nut, particularly for so-called blind fixing by the front side of a metal sheet provided with receiving openings, preferably square, the posterior side being in principle inaccessible, comprising a polygonal base made in one piece having an introduction side (11) corresponding in form and in size to the receiving opening, this side being provided with deformable gripping means, capable of fixing the insert in its opening and a posterior side (12) presenting at least on two of its parallel sides, rounded chamfers (14) allowing the introduction of the insert by the said front side, the deformable gripping means being presented in the form of two parallel tightening lines (l1, l2) characterized in that each tightening line comprises two deformable projections (17, 18) separated by a slot (16) situated in the middle (17, 18) of each line in such a way as to make a free space between two projections, which weakens on the one hand the resistance to bending of the deformable projections and on the other hand, serves as a lodging place for an immobilization and guiding finger (27), originating from a placing device of the insert-nut.
