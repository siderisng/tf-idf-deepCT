<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new methods stabilized by reacting with aminoplastial artists and carbonyl compounds or their condensation products, several methods for their preparation as well as their use for various purposes. the compounds containing a content of 0.5 to 55% by weight of ionic groups of the formula in which R has the meaning given in the description, and with a content of 0.5 to 15% by weight of the groups of the formula formed by decarboxylation reactions can be carried out after several methods Enhanting, z. b. by optionally containing modified modified azulmic acids with a content of 0.5 to 55 weight percent of ionic groups in aqueous medium optionally in the presence of additives and optionally in the presence of catalysts and optionally in the presence of chain breakers with aminoplastial artists and carbonyl compounds or their freshly prepared , optionally chemically modified condensation products. Numerous substances according to the invention can be used as a flame retardant or aging protection agent for the prevention of the oxidative degradation in a wide variety of polyurethane fuels, vinyl polymers, polyamidunsts substances, rubbers and epoxy resins. In addition, adducts of applied stabilized azulmic acids are suitable with compounds, such as. b. Phospholine oxide phosphonic acids, as catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of isocyanates and polyisocyanates to polycarbodiimides. In addition, substances according to the invention can be used as carrier materials for numerous catalysts, whereby mixed catalysts arise, which can be used in the length of the length.
