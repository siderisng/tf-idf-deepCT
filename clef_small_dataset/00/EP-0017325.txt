<ABSTRACT>
a conveyor drive (24) for a glass manufacturing system  transports a sheet of glass (12) through a tempering station  (10) on a roller bed (36).  the conveyor drive (24) includes a  pair of pulleys (28,30) mounted at opposed ends of the  tempering station (10).  a continuous drive loop (26) is  trained over the pair of pulleys (28,30) and engages the roller  bed (36) so that rotational motion of the pulleys is imparted  to the roller bed.  one pulley (28) is driven by a motor (40) to  transport the glass through the station.  the other pulley (30)  drives an electrical generator (42) connected to a dissipative  load (44).  the generator (42) and load (44) provide an  adaptive counter-torque to the other pulley (30) in direct  relation to its rotational speed.  the counter-torque stabilizes  the conveyor drive (24) to prevent slip-stick friction from  disrupting the transport of the glass sheet (12).
