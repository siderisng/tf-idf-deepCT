<ABSTRACT>
a device for inserting and removing studs 16 from  bores 19 in a workpiece, for example a nuclear reactor  vessel, comprises manupulating devices 22 for operating  on individual studs.  each device 22 is capable of tension­ ing a stud 16, slackening a working nut 17 on the stud, and  subsequently removing the stud from the bore.  a ring 92  has dogs 93 which can engage recesses in the working nut  to interlock with the nut against relative rotation.  motors  100 are coupled to the ring 92 and operable to rotate the  working nut to interlock with the nut against relative rota­ tion.  motors 100 are coupled to the ring 92 and operable to  rotate the working nut.  a top nut 51 is coupled to motor  100 which are operable to rotate the nut and screw it onto  the stud 16.  the top nut 51 together with other operating  parts of the device can be raised and lowered on a tube 61  by means of a hydraulic actuator 65.  a hydraulic load cell  52 is located between the top nut and a stool 53 which  rests on the workpiece.  the load cell 52 can be pressurised  to tension the stud 16 by means of the top nut 51 and thus  facilitate rotation of the working nut 17 when tightening or  slackening.  a dog clutch mechanism 26 provides means  for engaging an end fitting 25 on the stud and locking it  against relative axial and rotational movement.  the dog  clutch mechanism can be raised and lowered on a guide  member 36 by an actuator 38.  the dog clutch mechanism  has a tubular member 42 and the drive coupling for the  motor 100 to the top nut 51 includes a tubular member 61.   both of the tubular members 42 and 61 carry teeth 43 and  85 which are engagable with one another to provide a  clutch.  the teeth 43 and 85 are engaged when the top nut  51 is raised and the dog clutch mechanism 26 is lowered,  to provide a coupling between the motors 100 and the dog  clutch mechanism for rotating the stud.
