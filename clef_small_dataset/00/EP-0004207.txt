<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for and method of stacking rectangular  objects comprising a cage which as three closed vertical  sides (2, 3) formed by a lattice framework, the fourth side (4)  being open.  a rectangular base plate (1) of the cage has an  openended slot (5) therein extending inwardly from the open  front side (4) of the cage.  the top of the cage is fitted with  lifting lugs (8).  the cage is suitable for lifting stacked bricks,  the bricks being stacked in alternate transverse and longitudinal  layers.  one or more bricks placed end-to-end support the  first transverse layer in overhanging fashion, so that the slot  (5) of the cage base can accommodate the support bricks and  lift the stacked layers by engagement between the base (1)  and the underneath of the lowest transverse layer.
