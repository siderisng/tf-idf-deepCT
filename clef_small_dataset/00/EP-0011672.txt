<ABSTRACT>
arrangement and method for detecting failure in a  welded connection, particularly applicable to not readily  accessible welds (26) such as those joining components (18,  20, 22, 24) within the reactor vessel (10) of a nuclear reactor  system.  a preselected tag gas (52) is sealed within a chamber  (42) which extends through selected portions of the base  metal (20, 22) and into the weld deposit (48).  in the event of a  failure, such as development of a crack extending from the  chamber (42) to an outer surface (50), the tag gas (52) is  released.  the environment about the welded area is directed  to an analyser (40) which, in the event of presence of the tag  gas (52), evidences the failure.
