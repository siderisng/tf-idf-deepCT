<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for cutting filamentary tows into prede­ termined lengths comprising (a) a cutting assembly (18)  including a plurality of spaced apart knife edges (28-400)  secured to a mounting member (22) at equal radial dis­ tances from a point on said mounting member thereby  forming a reel (18) each of said radial distances in every  instance being less than the distance from said point to  the periphery of said mounting member; (b) said cut­ ting assembly having means (20) adapted to receive  successive wrappings of material to be cut in contact with  a plurality of said knife edges so that no relative movement  occurs between said material and said knife edges longitu­ dinally of said material; and (c) means (42) for forcing  material between adjacent knife edges thereby sever­ ing said material into lengths of controlled dimensions,  characterised by means (111, 211, 311) for preventing at  least most of said knives from moving in a direction longi­ tudinal of said knife edges.
