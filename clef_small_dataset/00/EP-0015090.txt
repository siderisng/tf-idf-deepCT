<ABSTRACT>
unsized paper is treated with an aqueous composition  having a ph from 7. 8 to 8. 2 and comprising 10 to 70 parts of a  dissolved ionic fire retardant and 0. 2 to 1 parts of an emulsified  alkylketene dimer.   the time of treatment is such that the paper has a dry material  loading of fire retardant of 10 to 50% and of water repellant of  0. 4 to 1%.   the method is of particular use with handsheet paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method of and composition for sizing and fire proofing paper and paper made by the method" this invention relates to the treatment of a web of unsized paper with an aqueous composition of flame retardant salts and a sizing material to produce paper with good sizing, flame resistance and strength. the invention also relates to the composition usad for the treatment of the unsized paper and the paper produced by the treatment. it is known to treat paper to render it flame resistant. however, the materials that gre applied are expensive and can reduce both the strength and water resistance of the final paper. it has been proposed to render a paper both water and fire resistant. however, it is very difficult to achieve this because the addition to paper of fire retarding compounds usually decreases significantly the water resistance of the paper. many methods have been proposed for preparing water and fire resistant paper and some of these are set out in british patent no. 1 500 612, to the international paper company. it will be seen from this patent that there are many problems to be solved in finding a suitable process for preparing fire and water resistant paper. one of the major problems is that in may cues the fire retarding agent and the water repelling agent are incompatible. another problem is that most solutions used to fire - and water-proof paper are acidic. these solutions attack the processing rollers in a paper mill and therefore make it necessary for the rollers to be replaced or refurbished frequently. this clearly adds to the cost of the paper making process and reduces its efficiency. it is an aim of the present invention to provide a papertreating solution which contains a compatible fire retardant and water repellant, and which does not corrode processing rollers to any substantial extent. according to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an aqueous paper-treating solution comprising from 10 to 70 parts of an ionic fire retardant material and from 0.2 to 1 part of an alkylketene dimer, wherein the solution has a ph from 7.8 to 8.2, preferably 8.0. the solution according to the present invention has the advantage that paper treated with it does not show any evidence of incompatibility of the components. there is no evidence of one or the other component being unabsorbed by the paper. another advantage of the solution is that it is only mildly alkaline, so that it is unable to attack the processing rollers, thus enabling relatively cheap and efficient running of a paper processing plant. these advantages are obtained because of the careful control of the ph solution. preferably the alkylketene dimer is supplied as an aqueous emulsion containing about 6% of the alkylketene dimer. the lsin ay also contain a cationic starch as a protective colloid. an especially suitable emulsion, supplied by hercules powder company limited, is aquapel (rtm) 360x. this has a total solids content of 7.6%,an alkylketene dimer content
