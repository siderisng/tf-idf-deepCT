<ABSTRACT>
a blasting cartridge (1) has a tubular chamber (4)  containing a water-bearing blasting agent, and a longitudinal  tunnel (6) adjacent to the tubular chamber (4) and integral  therewith.  preferably, the tunnel (6) is full-length and conÂ­ tinuous and has holes (11) for threading a detonating cord  (17) therethrough and for holding the cord firmly against the  tubular chamber (4) for the cord-priming of the cartridges.  in  primer assemblies, the tunnel (6) also can be used to hold a  cap or booster (12) in place, and for lacing cap wires (13) or a  low-energy detonating cord.  a preferred cartridge is made  continuously in a series by wrapping a web of film having a  row of holes along one edge so as to form a tube and an  outer flap containing the holes, and sealing the tube and the  flap so as to form a tunnel containing the holes in its outer  portion, the wrapping being performed so that either the  inner or outer portion of the tunnel is circumferentially  longer than the other.
