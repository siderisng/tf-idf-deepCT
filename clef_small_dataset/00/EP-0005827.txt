<ABSTRACT>
organic material having a normal boiling point in excess  of 200Â°c and a relative volatility with respect to water of at  least one is removed from water contaminated therewith.   the process comprises passing a current of vapor, sufficient  to vaporize at least a portion of the organic material, through  a moving stream of the contaminated water.  in a preferred  embodiment, the process comprises adjusting the ph of the  contaminated water to a level sufficient to prevent substantial  dissociation of the organic material.  the contaminated  water is then countercurrently contacted with a sufficient  vapor flow to vaporize at least a portion of the organic  material.  the resulting organic material-containing vapor  can be recovered, and the organic material removed.   illustrative of the process is the removal by air stripping of  pentachlorophenol from waste water contaminated with  about 250 parts per billion thereof.
