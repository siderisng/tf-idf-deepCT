<ABSTRACT>
the tendency toward ice or solid hydrate formation dur­ ing cooling of a light hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon mixture  such as lpg or ngl for storage or transport at sub-zero temp­ eratures is eliminated by mixing it with aqueous methanol  solution in a mixer (5), cooling the mixture in cooler (8) and  thereafter separating the hydrocarbon and aqueous phase in  a separator (10), the solution being chosen to be substantially  insoluble in the hydrocarbon phase and freeze below the  temperature to which the mixture is cooled, and at least part  of the aqueous phase being recycled by pump (17) to the  mixer (5) for re-use with methanol being added as required to  restore its concentration in the recycling liquor towards that of  the initial aqueous solution and some of the recycling liquor  being removed as required to restore the quantity of circulat­ ing liquor towards its initial level.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to dehydration of hydrocarbons, and especially to the suppression of the formation of ice and/or solid hydrates during cooling of light hydrocarbons containing water. light hydrocarbons (which term includes herein mixtures of hydrocarbons) are normally stored and transported in the liquid phase. examples of light hydrocarbons are liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) consisting of propane or butane or an admixture of propane and butane with typically less than 10 mole percent of other hydrocarbons as impurities, and natural gas liquids (ngl) consisting chiefly of propane and butane but with substantial amounts (typically 10-40 mole percent) of impurities such as methane, ethane, pentane, hexane and heavier hydrocarbons. the term ngl as used herein also includes liquids with a high concentration of ethane together with appreciable concentrations of propane, butane and heavier components. other examples of light hydrocarbons include gasoline and aviation turbine fuel (avtur). lpg and ngl may be kept in the liquid state either by holding them at ambient temperature and high pressure, or, as is normally done in lpg carriers, at low temperature and ambient pressure. however, in the latter case, the cooling of the hydrocarbon is accompanied by the undesirable formation of ice and solid hydrates unless steps are taken to remove any water present. such dehydration is generally effected before the hydrocarbon material is loaded in to the lpg carrier. the dehydration is normally effected in the gaseous state at moderate temperatures, using glycol which is regenerated, or in the liquid state using soliddessicant absorbers. both methods require relatively heavy, bulky equipment, and must have a heat source such as steam, high-pressure hot water or hot flue gases, for regeneration of the glycol or solid dessicant. in applications where space and utility supplies are limited, therefore, it may be desirable to employ other means of ice/hydrate suppression. methanol is well known as an ice/hydrate suppressant, having the advantages that methanol/water mixtures (a) can remain fluid at very low temperatures where glycol/water mixtures would be viscous, slushy or even solid, and (b) form a separate phase from the hydrocarbon phase thus offering a simple separation process. however, methanol is not favoured over glycol as a drying agent for continuous use and regeneration. this is because methanol has a high vapour pressure compared with glycol, so that losses in the treated gas are substantial. also, methanol has a lower boiling point than water, so that in the recovery of the methanol from the methanol/water mixture enough heat must be supplied to evaporate all the methanol dessicant, while in the case of glycol only enough heat need be supplied to evaporate the absorbed water which will be a relatively much smaller volume. further, methanol is miscible with liquid light hydrocarbons when little or no water is present, so that if liquid-liquid contacting with substantially pure methanol is used, careful control must be maintained over the methanol flow rate to ensure that on the one hand enough methanol is used to ensure adequate ice/hydrate suppression, while on the other
