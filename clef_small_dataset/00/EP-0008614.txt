<ABSTRACT>
the degree of efficiency of oil burners is higher when the combustion air has a higher humidity than normal ambient air.  the present combustion-air humidifier for oil burners, which consists of a container, in which a given water level is maintained by, for example, a float valve, an air supply pipe which ends below the surface of the water, and an air removal pipe which begins above the surface of the water and opens into the oil burner chamber, serves to increase the humidity of the combustion air supplied to the oil burner.  the low pressure prevailing in the oil burner chamber draws air, which has been humidified by passing through the water in the container, from the container.  by means of an additional air device, which is connected to the air supply pipe, the extent of the humidification can then according to the invention be made adjustable to maximise the degree of efficiency, different embodiments being envisaged for the additional air device, which are particularly favourable according to the structure of the container and of the air pipes .  <image>
