<ABSTRACT>
method for applying a multi-layered protective layer to concrete walls (1), masonry, flat roofs or other mineral surfaces, in which a hardening coating layer is formed from an adhesive coating compound (2) which can be processed cold and an insert consisting of a web-shaped material (4) which is relatively thin in comparison with the said coating layer is embedded in the said layer.  the insert material (4) consists of a flexible film which holds back water in the liquid form and is provided on at least one side with a coating (3) which permits adhesion to the adhesive coating compound (2).  the film preferably comprises a supporting film (4) having a coating (3) on at least one side consisting of a laminated-on textile material or a rot-resistant permeable material, preferably glass cloth or matting.  the coating (3) is adhesively bonded or welded to the supporting film (4) over its entire area or joined to it via separate bonding or welding points (5) or strips distributed over the area of the film.  <image>
