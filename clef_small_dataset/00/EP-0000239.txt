<ABSTRACT>
a storage reel assembly and a pair of matable hub  members therefor.  the invention which relates to the art of packaging elongate  flexible material is intended to provide a storage reel  assembly comprising, as shown in figure 1, a pair of hub  members (24 and 26) which can be locked together to  assemble simple annular reel end flange members (12 and  14) to a simple annular spacer member (20), the same hub  members (24 and 26) being useable with a variety of different  sized reel end flange members (12 and 14) and spacer members  (20).  as shown in figure 2, the male hub member (26)  has a series of ribs (62,964) which form a row of interrupted  rings, the female hub member (24) having internal flanges  (34, 36).  when the hub members (24 and 26) have been  mated, they are relatively rotated to engage the flanges between  adjacent ribs (62 and 64).
