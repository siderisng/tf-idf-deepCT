<ABSTRACT>
supporting means for at least two rolls (4), of which the unwinding end of one roll is connected to the beginning of the other roll, by means of a frame having in each case two mounting supports (2) for receiving the ends of a spindle (3) carrying the roll which protrude from the roll.  in order to provide a space-saving arrangement and reduce effort during roll change, the mounting supports (2) for the rolls to be connected together are arranged one above the other on a common carrier (1a) of the frame and a lifting apparatus which can be attached to the ends of the spindles protruding laterally from the rolls is provided for raising the rolls.  the lifting apparatus is formed by two hooks (6) which can be attached in each case to one end of the spindle and which are in each case connected to a cable (7) which is guided over a deflection roll (8) mounted on the carrier above the upper mounting support, preferably in the manner of a block and tackle.  <image>
