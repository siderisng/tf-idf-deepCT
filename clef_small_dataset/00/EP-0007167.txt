<ABSTRACT>
large quantities of reclaimed tyre rubber can be incorpo­ rated into plastics material without seriously impairing its  impact strength by a method which comprises the steps of  swelling the reclaimed tyre rubber with a quantity of mono­ mer which is insufficient to saturate the reclaimed tyre rubber  and polymerizing the swollen mass.  the method is effective despite the multiplicity of addi­ tives such as extenders, antioxidants and lubricants present in  the reclaimed tyre rubber.  the preferred monomer is styrene.  in certain cases the plastics material can be electroplated  after suitable chemical treatment.
