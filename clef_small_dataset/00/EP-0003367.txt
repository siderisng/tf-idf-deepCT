<ABSTRACT>
a process for improving the strength characteristics of a  wire composed of an austenitic metal alloy selected from the  group consisting of stainless steel alloys of the aisi 200 and  300 series and non-stainless steel alloys containing iron,  manganese, chromium, and carbon, said alloy having an md  temperature of no higher than about 100°c and an ms  temperature of no higher than about minus 100°c, comprising  the following steps:   (a) deforming the wire at a strain of at least about 10  percent and at a temperature in the range of about md minus  50°c to about md plus 50°c, said md temperature being that  of the alloy undergoing deformation, in such a manner that  the wire has a martensite phase of no greater than about 10  percent by volume and an austenite phase of at least about  90 percent by volume and a yield strength in the range of  about 130,000 psi to about 230,000 psi;   (b) cooling the wire to a temperature no higher than  about minus 75°c; and   (c) drawing the cooled wire through a die under  back-tension (i) wherein the back-tension on said wire just  prior to the entry of the wire into the die is at least about  75,000 psi and (ii) whereby the cross-sectional area of the  wire is reduced by a percentage in the range of about 7  percent to about 25 percent,   in such a manner that the wire has a martensite phase of  at least about 50 percent by volume and an austenite phase  of at least about 10 percent by volume.
