<ABSTRACT>
a trenching implement (41) suitable for towing on the  sea bed to make a trench for a submarine cable or pipe­ line (54) comprises a body (44) attached to which is a soil  cutting member (46) which makes a soil surface in the di­ rection of travel of the implement, a landside (45) engaging  the soil surface and a towing means (56) connected so  that, when the direction of travel is different from the line  of the towing force (56), the line of the towing force (56),  projected if necessary, passes through a point (50) in the  region of the landside (45) with the result that the landside  (45) resists the sideways component of the towing force  (56).  this reduces the risk of damage to the cable or pipe­ line (54).
