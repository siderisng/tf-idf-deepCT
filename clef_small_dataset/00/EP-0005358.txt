<ABSTRACT>
an air speed sensitive variable pitch air deflector  comprises an airfoil (14) pivotally mounted on a vehicle  roof (11) adjacent the upper edge of a rear or tailgage  window (13).  at low vehicle speeds, the deflector occupies  a normal position in which it deflects air downwardly over  the window to assist in cleaning the window.  above a  predetermined vehicle speed, the flow of air over the airfoil  changes the pitch of the airfoil so that the airfoil offers  less drag and the fuel economy degradation produced by  the braking effect of the air deflector can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification title air deflector for motor vehicles scri this invention relates td air deflectors. in u.s. patent no. 3,56,044 the statement is made "it is common in connection with autozobiles of the station wagon type to utilise wind deflectors adjacent the rear window in an effort to prevent the accunulation or dirt and other foreign matter on the rear wiow. his accumulation results form the partial vacuum formed immedisialy behind the vehicle as the latter is driven forwardly tsee u.. patent no. 3,097,882). the solution to the partial vacuum proble@ as disclosed in ooth the above cited patents (which are representative of the prior artj comprities the placement of a tixed deflector element adjacent the vehicle rear window. the fixed deflector is mounted so that it projects into the airatream flowing across the top of the moving vehicle and turns the airstream downwardly across the roar window. the downward flow of air breaks the partial vacuum and prevents the adhesion of dirt and other particulate luiittor to the widnow surface. the rixeci deflector has a disadvantage in that, as the vehicle speed increases, the fixed deflector acts as @ air brake. this results in a uegradation in fuel economy. i'he present invention proviues an air defl@ctor assembly for a motor vehicle comprising an airfoil, support means adapted to be secured to the vehicle adjacent the upper dege of the rear window of the vehicle, and pivot means coupling tfle airfoil to the support zeans for swinging movement about a pivot axis between a first position in which the airfoil deflects air flowing thereover downwardly, and a second pasition in which the drag exerted by the airfoil on the air flowing thereover is reuucea, the airfoil being movable from the first position into the second position by the pressure exerted thereon by the air flowing over the airfbil. in use, the air deflector assembly is mounted on suitable support means on a vehicle roof adjacent the upper edge of a rear or tailgate window. rreferably, the airfoil is coupled to the support means by suitable pivot means that per mit frco swinging movement about a pivot axis defined by the pivot means. the airfoil is swingably om a maxi@um pitch position relative to the vehicle roof in which it creates an air brake effect on ine vehicle to a minimum pitch position at which it lits substantially parallel to tht: of, thereby nullifying tht air but effect. the airfoil, of its own weight. maintains the maximum pitch; position in which it acts as an air ezefle ctor directing the airstream comnwardly over the rear window of the vchicle until the vehicle apeed attains a velocity at which the pressure of the ai ratream causes sufficient lift on the airfoil to swing the latter upwardly toward pitch position relative to the vehicle roof. a preferred emboaiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanylng drawings, in which : fig. l is a porspective
