<ABSTRACT>
the device may be used as a pump, a motor or a vibrator  for concrete.  it includes a body (10) having at least three, and  preferably four or five wall portions (42), which are disposed  one after the other along the axis of the body (10), discrete  chambers (43) being formed behind each wall portion (42),  which may, for example, be a toroidal diaphragm, means  (24-55) being provided to feed an operating fluid under pres­ sure to the discrete chambers (43) to move the wall portions  (42) transversely to the axis of the body (10) in a sequence to  cause displacement of an external fluid axially of the body  (10).  when used as a motor, movement of the external fluid  th axially of the body will cause displacement of the wall por­ tions and thus flow of the operating fluid so that power may be  derived therefrom.
