<ABSTRACT>
the invention is directed to a composition for a friction  material, eg a brake pad, of the type which consists of a  fibrous reinforcement, a binder, and various additives.  the friction material contains no asbestos but has properties  comparable with asbestos-based materials.  the composition  contains a thermoset binder which includes a phenol  formaldehyde resin, although it may also contain a heat and  chemical resistant rubber.  the binder makes up 20 to 45 per  cent by volume of the material.  as sole fibrous reinforcement 5 to 15% by volume of steel  fibre is used, and the material also contains at least 10% by  volume of an inert mineral filler eg barytes, whiting, silica.
