<ABSTRACT>
Parallel Plans Antenna of the Pill-Box or Cheese with the cylindro-parabolic part (10) is constituted by a semi-transparent reflector and whose focal plane is constituted by a polarizer reflector.(11) The cylindro-parabolic semi-transparent reflector consists of a network of wires (12) parallel to the polarization plane of the wave emitted by the source.The polarizer reflector is formed of a reflective plate (14) located at λ / 4 of a network (15) of parallel wires (16) inclined at 45 ° relative to the polarization plane of the incident wave.Application to monitoring and lens designation antennas.
