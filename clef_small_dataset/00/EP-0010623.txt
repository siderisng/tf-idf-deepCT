<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing a layered structure for highly integrated semiconductor assemblies in which an insulating layer is preferably seen between two conductive layers. Smaller than the photolithographically determined minimal dimensions can be achieved when, after the application and molding and moldings of the first conductive layer (56) on the pad (50, 54), on the above-lying substantially horizontal and in essential vertical surfaces, a covering and applied to adapting insulating layer (62). This insulating layer is then subjected to a reactive ion etching method such that substantially the horizontal regions of the insulating layer are removed and narrow vertically directed regions of the insulating layer (62) remain, to which then a second conductive layer can be applied. Depending on the choice of the original layer thickness of the insulating layer, different side distances can be adjusted. Applications of this procedure are treated in bipolar and FET technology.
