<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for tensioning a pull rope wound on the drum of a winch and is connected to one end to a positional object, in particular for tensioning a current cable leading to a mobile carbon wiring machine. The winch, preferably a commercially available pressure running powered tractor reel, is adjustable and reversible bar powered and can also deliver a continuous torque at a standstill. In addition, a tensioning device standing under the force of a spring (13) is provided with a tension roller (11) around which the pulling rope (6) is guided, so that a desired target voltage can be adjusted in the drawstring via the spring force. Characteristics of the tensioning roller effect via an actuating linkage (14) a control of the winch that the tension roller (11) returns to the original equilibrium position. This control process may be accompanied by that the winch can be drained or retrieved the rope. Instead of the tension roller (11), the clamping device may also include another movable member, for example, the drum (9a) of the winch (9) when the winch is movable as a whole opposite spring force.
