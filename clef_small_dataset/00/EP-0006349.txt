<ABSTRACT>
a shutter for a window is provided, the shutter com足 prising a plurality of panels (16-19) of thermal insulation  material, the panels being hinged together such that in use  they are movable between a closed, extended, position  in which they lie in substantially the same plane to provide  a thermal insulation screen and an open, collapsed, po足 sition in which they lie folded together.  the shutter provides thermal insulation characteristics  which are significantly more effective than those of double-足 glazing but without many of the disadvantages of double-足 glazing.

<DESCRIPTION>
shutter and window drovided with such a shutter the invention relates to shutters and more particularly to shutters for windows. it is well known that a single pane of glass provides little or no thermal insulation, but the conventional method of providing additional insulation is to provide a double-glazed window, there being two sheets of glass with a layer of air trapped therebetween. however double-glazing has a number of disadvantages. firstly, the arrangement is permanent and while it reduces heat loss when outside conditions are colder than the inside conditions, it also restricts the entry of heat when the outer conditions are hotter. furthermore it is difficult to effectively doubleglaze existing windows and it is usually necessary to fit completely new frames. a further disadvantage is that there is a risk of condensation between the two sheets of glass. the invention aims to provide thermal insulation for windows, without the disadvantages associated with double-glazing. the invention provides a shutter for a window, the shutter comprising a plurality of panels of thermal insulation material, the panels being hinged together such that in use they are movable between a closed, extended, position in which they lie substantially in the same plane to provide a thermal insulation screen and an open, collapsed, position in which they are folded together. the panels may be hinged such that when moving between the open and closed positions they adopt a zig-zaz or concertina configuration. sach panel may comprise a pair of sheets between which a thermal insulation foam material is sandwiched. apolyisocyanuratefoam may be used. each sheet may comprise a laminate such as formica or wareite. alternatively each sheet may comprise or be finished in metal (e.g. steel) plastics, timber or fabric. the sheets may be attached to opposite sides of a support frame, e.g. of timber. alternatively the sheets may comprise opposite sides of a hollow plastics extrusion which contains the thermal insulation foam. preferably each panel is connected to the or each a'?acer.t panel by a continuous hinge so that there is no air gap between the panels. k continuous flexible plastics hinge may be used, for example constructed of pol mropylene. preferably each shutter is provided with a hinge at the free edge of one of the panels for use in mounting the shutter in position adjacent to a window. the hinge is preferably a continuous hinge so that there is no air rat' when thc shutter is mounted. a continuous flexible plastics hinge ira be used, for example constructed of polypropylene. ne shutter may be provided in combination with sealing strips which, when the shutter is in use, are used to provide a seal along the two edges of the shutter which extend transversely of the hinges when the shutter is in the closed position. the sealing strips may comprise flexible wining seals of rubber, synthetic rubber or plastics. freferably two shutters are provided which, in use, can be merited at opposite edges of a window and which, n the closed pos-:tion,

   claims:      1. a shutter for a window, characterised in that the shutter comprises a   plurality    of panels (16-19) of thermal insulation material, the panels being hinged together such that in use   they    are movable between a closed, extended, position in   whic      they    lie in substantially the same plane to   provide    a thermal insulation screen, and an open, collapped, rosition in which they are folded   toget;er.      2. a shutter as claimed in claim 1, in which the panels are hinged such   that      then      moving      between    the open and closed positions   they    aropt a   - zar    or concertina configuration.   3. a abutter as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which each panel comprises a pair of   sheets      (2@)    between   hicl-    a thermal insulation foam (22a) is sandwiched.   4. a abutter as claimed in   cl@im    7, in which the form is a polyisocyanurate   foa@".      5. a shutter as claimed in clsim 5 or cleim 4, in   which    each sheet   comprises    a   l@@inete.      6. a shutter as claimed in   any one of cl@ims    3 to 5, in which the sheste are articled so opposite sided of a support frame (20,21).     7. a shutter as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, in which the sheets comprise opposite sides of a hollow plastics extrusion which contains the thermal insulation foam.   8. a shutter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in   hich    each panel is connected to the or each qadjacent panel by a continuous hinge (24,25) so that there is no air gap between the panels.      9.      h    shutter as claimed in claim 8, in which a continuous flexible plastics hinge is used.   10. a shutter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, provided with a hinge (26) at the free edge of one of the panels for use in mounting the shutter in position adjacent to a window.   11. a shutter as claimed in claim 10, in which the hinge is   e    continuous hinge so that there is no air gap when the shutter is mounted.   12.   h    shutter as claimed in claim 11, in which the hinge is e continuous flexible plastics hinge.   13. a shutter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in combination with sealing strips   (29,30)    which when the shutter is in use, are used to provide a seal along the two edges of the shutter which extend transversely of the hinges when the shutter is in the closed position.      1@.      utter    as claimed in claim   13,    in which the sealing strips comprise flexible wiping seals of rubber, syathetie rubber, or plastics material.      15. a shutter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in combination with a second similar shutter such that the two shutters can, in use, be   mounted    at opposite edges of a window an which, in the closed position, meet to provide a thermal insulation screen over substantially the  entire area of the window.   16. a   shutter    as claimed in clair 15, in   which    means (32,33) are provided to form a seal   where    the two shutters meet.    17. a shutter as claimed in claim   1g,    in which a    sea@ing    strip is provided on one shutter which  provides a wiring seal on the other shutter when both shutters are closed.   18. a window when fitted with one or more shutters as claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
