<ABSTRACT>
package comprising a first (1) and a second (2) container  which snappingly engage each other.  the first container (1)  is provided with a circumferential ledge (8) and the second  container (2) with a part 16 having an inwardly directed lip 17  snappingly engaging the lower edge (19) of ledge 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
package. the invention relates to a package, comprising a lower or first container and an upper or second container, which interact with one another. packages of this type, consisting of a lower and an upper container, the upper edges of which are superimposed and interconnected, are known. a problem with these known packages is that special measures have to be taken so as to unite the upper and the lower container with each another, while furthermore, after the respective closure has been broken, the package can no longer be closed off in a moisture-proof manner, thus enabling moisture to penetrate into the container and the remaining contents. this is very disadvantageous, especially when crisp foodstuffs like for instance biscuits, have to be packed. the same applies to packages filled with moist products, like for instance rye, as the impossibility tightly close a lower and an upper container after said closure has been broken, may involve an escape of moisture from the latter foodstuffs. the present invention aims to provide a package of the aforementioned type, not presenting said disadvantages. this object is attained according to the invention in that in a package, comprising a lower and an upper container, an edge part of the upper container snappingly interacts with an edge part of the lower container. as soon as part of the contents of a package according to the invention, for example biscuits, has been removed after having opened the respective package, the upper container may be sealingly re-united with the lower container, by a snapping interaction of the respective edge parts of the two containers, so that the remainin contents of the said package is protected against any outside hampering influence. the upper and lower container may be nested into one another in a very favourable manner, for which aim the upper edge parts of the lower and of the upper container snappingly engage one another, so producing a very appropriate package. both the lower containers and the upper containers may advantageously be mutually nested. this favourable effect enables a considerable economy of space, which is especially important when nested lower and upper containers have to be transported to a foctory, in order to have them filled. another important factor of nested upper and lower containers is that the lower container may be filled up to a certain level, with one component, preferably a dry product, whereafter the upper container is nested into the lower contoiner, said upper container then being filled with another additional product. the assembly so obtained may then be closed off by means of a covering foil, such as e.g. an aluminium foil. actually the desired packages may also be obtained by superimposing the lower and upper container upon one another, in a reverse manner. the upper edge of the lower container is then provided with a covering layer, in the form of, for example, an aluminium foil or a plastics foil, whilst the second or upper container is likewise provided with a covering layer

<CLAIMS>
 claims   1. package, comprising a lower or first container and an upper or second container, which interact with one another, characterized in that an edge part of the upper container snappingly interacts with an edge part of the lower container.   2. package according to claim   l,    in which the lower and the upper container may be nested into one another while the upper edge parts of the lower and the upper container snappingly interact with one another on nesting the upper and lower container.   3. package according to claim   l,    in which the upper and lower container cooperate snappingly with one another in a reverse superimposed position, by means of an upper edge part.   4. package according to any or more of the preceding claims, in which at least one of the containers is closed off by means of a covering layer, preferably consisting of a metal or a plastics foil.   5. package according to any or more of the preceding claims, in which a first or lower container is provided with an upper portion (6, 9), which tapers inwardly.   6. package according to any or more of the preceding claims, in which an inner circumferential edge (5) is provided at the location of the transition of the lowermost portion of the lower or first container and the uppermost portion of the lower or first container.     7. package according to any or more of the preceding   claims;    in which the second or upper container is provided with an uppermost portion which tapers in a narrowing manner towards the free upper side, and preferably adjoins a flat transition edge (13).   8. package according to any or more of the preceding claims, in which the inner diameter of the uppermost side (9a) of the first or lower container is smaller than the outer diameter of the second or upper container at the location of the outside of the transition edge (13), thus causing a snap connection when nesting the first or lower and the second or upper container into one another, in such a manner that the upper edges of said containers then rest against each other.   9. package according to any or more of the preceding claims, in which the upper edge of at least one of the containers is extended at the location of the circumference with an inwardly curved part or lip (17) which can snappingly interact with a projecting part or ledge ( 8) provided at the circumference of the edge (7) of the other container.    10. package according to any or more of the preceding claims, in which the two containers are nested into one another, while the upper side of the package is sealed off by a covering layer, whereas the first and the second   containerare      preferablyeach    provided with a separate covering layer (10, 21) the covering layer (10) of the first container being supported by the support edge   (7)    of the first or lower container, and the covering layer (21) of the second container being supported by the supporting edge (15) of the second or upper container.
