<ABSTRACT>
a defect tolerant lattice file memory having means in  the access column for annihilating lattice bubbles in a pre­ viously detected defective row thus eliminating an error in  the digital information to be extracted from the lattice file.   this annihilation means comprises a ladder formed in a  conductor overlay located over the access column in  which partial current loops may be formed by disconnect­ ing certain selected portions of the ladder.  these current  loops create a localized magnetic field when the ladder  conductor is activated thus annihilating the selected row of  bubbles.  thus lattice file chips found to have defective  rows which will not support and maintain lattice bubbles in  theirs desired coded state can now be utilized.
