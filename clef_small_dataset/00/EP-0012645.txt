<ABSTRACT>
The plate antenna has two symmed openings (6, 7) with a slot (9) which brings together the two open tures. The slot is oriented along the axis (10) joining the centers of the openings. The antenna is constituted by two crooked rings (1, 2) tangent, the tangency area of ​​the crowns being the least possible possible in the direction perpendicu to the axis passing through the centers. An edge of the slot is excited in the vicinity of the symmetry center (5) of the year tenne while the middle point of at least one crown on the axis, on the other side of the center relative to the zone Tangency, is at the mass. The antenna is carried out on a double-sided printed circuit, the power supply being made by a substantially semicircular band line whose radius is substantially the arithmetic average of the internal and external circles of a crown. It is complemented by a reflective plan arranged behind the antenna, parallel to the plane of the antenna. Several network antennas can be disposed of, the loops being electrically combined.
