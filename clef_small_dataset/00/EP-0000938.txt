<ABSTRACT>
macromolecular complexes which comprise a first  and a second macromolecular moiety joined by a link  derived from a linking agent having two or more reactive  groups, one of these reactive groups being an activated  acyl group, an isocyanate, an isothiocyanate, an iminoether,  an iminothioether or an activated halogen atom  attached to an aromatic ring and being capable of reacting  with one of the macromolecules from which the macromolecular  moieties are derived, under conditions where  the remaining reactive group, or groups which is or are  each an aziridine ring, an aryl azido group or a halogen  atom in an Î±-position relative to a carbonyl group or two  carbon atoms removed from a heteroatom carrying a lone  pair of electrons, is or are substantially unreactive.  methods are provided for making the complexes and  so are uses for the complexes.  pharmaceutical formulations  containing the complex as are provided.
