<ABSTRACT>
rigid polyurethane foam is prepared by reacting a polyol  containing at least three active hydrogen atoms with a  polyfunctional isocyanate or isothiocyanate in the presence of  a gel catalyst and a blowing agent.  as gel catalyst there is used  a catalyst composition comprising an antimony carboxylate,  a potassium carboxylate and a zinc carboxylate wherein the  hydrocarbyl as hereinbefore defined portion of each carboxy­ late contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein each of  the antimony and potassium carboxylates constitutes from 10  to 40% by weight of the total carboxylate content and the zinc  carboxylate constitutes the remaining 20 to 80% by weight of  the total carboxylate content, either alone or in combination  with another gel catalyst, particularly one chosen from terti­ ary amines, inorganic tin compounds an organotin com­ pounds.  the use of the specified gel catalyst composition  enables the isocyanate- or isothiocyanate- polyol reaction to  be controlled over a wide range.
