<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for detecting trace quantities of chemical  species in the form of a vapour by subjecting ions produced  in a sample of the mixed gases under flow to an ion repulsive  electric field which is directed in the opposite direction to the  flow of the gases, comprising means such as a fan (13) for  drawing the sample through a hollow body, having an inlet  (7), a first region (15) containing means (20) for ionising at  least a proportion of the molecules of the sample by a corona  discharge, a second region (16) in which the sample is subjected  to an oppositely directed ion repulsive electric field  and a third region (17) having an electrode (24) for collecting  ions of selected polarity.  ions of a selected polarity whose  ionic mobilities exceed a value dependent on the strength of  the ion repulsive electric field and the velocity of the gas flow  are prevented from entering the third region (17).  means  such as a resistor (71) may be provided to limit the current of  the corona electric discharge to a value not greater than 100  nanoamps.
