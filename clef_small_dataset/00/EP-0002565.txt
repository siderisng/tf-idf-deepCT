<ABSTRACT>
the connector comprises two coupling parts, (10, 16) for  optically coupling glass fibres (20, 22).  the parts (10, 16)  comprise locating wall (18, 19) and similarly shaped but  slightly larger recesses (21) in which the walls fit.  the parts  (10, 16) comprise male members (14) and sockets (12).  each  male member comprises a tapered shoulder (46) and each  socket comprises a co-operating tapered shoulder (34).  as  the member (14) is inserted into its aligned socket (12), the  tapered shoulders (46, 34) co-operate and act to centre the  free end of the member (14).  the end faces of the fibres (20,  22) substantially abut in end-to-end relationship when the  surfaces (26) abut.  the centering action of the shoulders (46,  34) compensates for an axial or radial mis-alignment of the  respective male members (14) and sockets (12) due to  manufacturing tolerances.
