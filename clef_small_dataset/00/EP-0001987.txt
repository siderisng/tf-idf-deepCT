<ABSTRACT>
In a copy or printing device with a band-shaped intermediate carrier (1) with z. b. a photoelectric layer of charge images of the character to be printed generates. These are developed with toner and then on a recording medium (6), z. b. Paper, reprinted. In this case, a high percentage of the toner located on the intermediate carrier should be transferred to the recording medium (6). For this purpose, mechanical means are provided, through which during the pressure process of the intermediate carrier (1) with the concrete side with the recording medium (6) is brought into contact. The intermediate carrier (1) consists of a material of such elasticity that can lead to a standstill for a short time when the area provided for this purpose. The mechanical means may be made of a stationary strip (13) disposed on one side of the intermediate carrier (1) and consist of a movable beam (12) disposed on the other side of the intermediate carrier (1).
