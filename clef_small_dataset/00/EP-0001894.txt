<ABSTRACT>
the invention is concerned with the provision of tubing  formed from helically wound strip which is strong yet light in  weight and consists in the formation of articles using an elongated  strip which has on it a series of longitudinally  positioned upstanding ribs (2) to form between them a series  of longitudinally positioned channels (6) and including connecting  means (2a, 2b) on the strip spaced apart transversely  or the strip whereby the strip can be wound helically to form  an elongated object with the connecting means interengaged  along a helical line to lock the strip in object form.  due to the  use of ribs the strip may have a thin wall but have substantial  strength.
