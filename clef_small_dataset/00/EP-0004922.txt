<ABSTRACT>
an effective amount of silicon carbide, preferably mixed  with graphite, is added to the blend of coals used to make a  foundry coke, the blend is thoroughly mixed, pulverized, and  coked in a by-product coke oven.  the resulting coke has  improved physical and chemical properties allowing production  of gray iron with less fuel.  gray iron castings with  improved hardness control at lower cost are produced by the  inoculating effect of the silicon from silicon carbide and  graphite in the mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
iron, the commonest and most useful metal, is always used commercially in the alloyed form, as its properties can be varied as to hardness, ductility, flexibility, tensile strength, chemical resistance, and other properties by the choice, amounts, and combination of alloying elements. gray cast iron is distinguished by a relatively high amount of carbon, approximately 3%, which imparts to it the characteristic hardness, castability, wear resistance, and machinability displayed by no other metal. gray cast iron is unique in its high content of carbon, and in the form of a large portion of this carbon as a separate phase of graphite. the strength, wear resistance, brittleness or conversely toughness, and machinability are all controlled to a large and primary extent by the graphitic carbon content. graphite in gray iron appears in several forms well-known to the foundry metallurgist, of which the so-called type a, a flake, is preferred, in a pearlitic iron matrix. if the carbon is present as iron carbide, or cementite, the metal will be what is known as white iron, hard, brittle, and unmachinable. if the carbon is present in the correct proportion as graphite in the pearlitic matrix, it will display the characteristic gray color and good machinability of gray iron. (this treatment ignores the effects of the other alloying elements and heat treatment and will be limited to the effects of silicon and carbon upon the properties of gray cast iron, in order to simplify its complex subject matter.) when gray iron is melted in a cupola over a bed of hot coke, it gains some carbon content from the coke, which may be varied by adjusting the coke-iron ratio, the air blast, by additives such as silicon, and by the slag chemistry. when it is poured into the molds to produce parts, the utility of these parts is affected by the cooling rate, and the rate of precipitation from solution of the various forms of iron. an iron melt which hardens too quickly will have an excess of iron carbide and have the characteristics of white iron, hard, brittle, poorly machinable, and relatively strong. if the iron has an excess of carbon as graphite with the metal predominantly in the form of primary ferrite from a tog slow cooling rate, the metal will have low tensile strength and be too soft to be commercially useful. the amount and shape, size, and distribution of graphite present in a gray cast iron are usually controlled by the addition of an inoculant to the metal in the cupola, the ladle, or the mold which furnishes seeds for formation of crystals of graphite. inoculants commonly used are silicon in various forms, such as ferrosilicon or silicon carbide, and graphite itself. other metals used include chromium, manganese, calcium, titanium, zirconium, aluminum, barium and strontium some of the elements function as alloying elements as well, in particular molybdenum, chromium, and manganese. aluminum and the alkaline earths are the most effective nongraphitic inoculants. silicon is the principal element used as an
