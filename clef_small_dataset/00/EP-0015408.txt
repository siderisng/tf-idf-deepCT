<ABSTRACT>
At a metallurgical vessel (1), in particular on a tiltable and / or circumferential steelworks converter (1) mounting fragrances (5) are attached to the vascular wall. Parallel and / or perpendicular to the vessel longitudinal axis (1b) extending, bending soft, stretch bars, which are attached to the support cracks (5) and to the vessel (1) with distance surrounding support or running rings (2), hold the vessel (1) In the support or race (2). In order to ensure a vertical-free tilting of the vessel (1), the pull rods are biased by forming bias units together with a supporting claw (5) and the support or race (2) and clamping push (11, 12). With a high load of a drawbar, which results from the weight of the vessel (1) together with its murmur and its filling weight, is necessary to provide more than one pull rod in a fastening field between the vessel (1) and support ring (2) . For higher utilization of the load capability of the bias units and to travel for the mounting surface available on the support ring or running ring end faces with a relatively low number of bias units, a bias unit is superimposed at least one further bias unit, whose clamping heads (11, 12) each indirectly or immediately supported on the first biasing stage, wherein a bias unit penetrates the other or the others with their drawbars.
