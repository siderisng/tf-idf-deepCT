<ABSTRACT>
externally coated steel tube is made from steel strip by  longitudinally folding and welding the strip to form the tube  (200), preheating (205) the tube and applying powder (206) to  the exterior of the preheated tube.  the tube is then baked at a  higher temperature before cooling.  in order to achieve an  even and continuous coating when using thermosetting  material as the coating powder, the temperature given to the  tube by the preheating (205) is such as to cause the coating  powder to melt and spread out immediately on application to  form a substantially continuous coating, before substantial  curing of the coating material occurs.  suitably, this is  provided by passage of the tube through a box (207) which  maintains the temperature of the tube.
