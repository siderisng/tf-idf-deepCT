<ABSTRACT>
the matrix is used for switching optical signals between  input and output single strand optic fibre light guides (10, 11,  12, 17, 36, 53).  the matrix is simple, relatively inexpensive,  and easily constructed, and may be made in larger sizes than  devices using solid crystalline materials.  switching is effected  by the selected application of voltages to layers of nematic  liquid crystal (21, 39, 41 . . . ) between parallel-sided prisms (16,  30, 51 . . . ), causing either transmission or total internal reflec­ tors of the light signal.  light absorbers (75a, 78a, 102a, . . . )  may be provided at end faces of the prisms not coupled to  light guides.  the light from the light guides is collimated, and  polarizers (p13, p14, p15, . . . ) may be provided.  inactive reg­ ions between the prisms may be filled with material of similar  refraction index, or may be provided with mirrors.

<DESCRIPTION>
electro-optical switching matrix the invention relates to electrooptical devices for switching unpolarized or polarized optical signals between input and output multimode single strand fibre optical guides, and it is an object of the invention to provide switching devices of this kind. optical switching devices employing electrooptical materials such as linbo or lira03 are known in the prior art. while some degree of success has been achieved in devising such electric field switched devices in matrix form, the use of the solid crystalline materials imposes serious limitations. generally, the size of available linbo3 crystals is seriously limited, and there is no apparent opportunity for overcoming this size limitation without extreme expense. no other solid electrooptical materials are known to have large electrooptic coefficients and otherwise suitable properties. with array substrate sizes limited in this manner, the number of switch elements that may be employed in matrix switches constructed of such materials is severely limited. the technical paper "nematic crystal digital light deflector" by g. labrunie and s. valette, beginning on page 1802 of volume 13, number 8 in the august 1974 issue of applied optics describes a light deflector in which a liquid crystal layer is disposed between transparent electrodes on the adjacent faces of a pair of cooperating prisms. a light ray entering an input face of a first of the prisms is incident to the liquid crystal layer at an angle of 710. the light ray therefore enters the first prism perpendicular to its input face, the angles of the prism being selected also to be about 71 . the transmitted light beam normally passes through an opposite exit face of the second prism at right angles thereto; when an electric field is imposed across the liquid crystal film, the input beam is totally internally reflected at the layer to pass through the opposite exit face of the first prism and at right angles thereto. the invention applies a similar principle to provide electrooptical matrix switches for selectively switching pluralities of optical signals between collimating input and decollimatjng output fibre light guides of the multimode, single strand kind. switching is accomplished by selective electric field excitation of a positive or of a negative anisotropy liquid crystal medium. the switch structure comprises an assembly of parallel-sided prisms of trapezoidal section having end-faces inclined at an angle approximating the critical angle, the liquid crystal medium being contained between the parallel faces of consecutive prisms, and forming one, two or more active regions, each provided with electrodes for application of the switching voltages. the complete configuration may have one or more degrees of geometric symmetry, or none at all. all the prisms and all the liquid crystal layers may cooperate, for example, in directing light signals from three inputs to selected ones of three outputs, while half of the prisms cooperate with light absorbers for removing unwanted scattered light. in generally- symmetric matrices for positive anisotropy fluids according to the invention, each liquid crystal layer contains active regions in which a liquid

 claims       1. an optical device in which light incident on a layer (4) of nematic    liquid crystal material between parallel-sided transparent bodies (1, 5) at an angle   bk    approximating the critical angle is selectively either transmitted or totally internally reflected in response to a voltage applied to the layer, characterised in that the device comprises an assembly of parallel-sided prism (16, 30, 51....) of trapezoidal section having end-faces (20, 22, 2i, 37...) inclined at an angle   g,    a plurality of input or output single-strand optic fibre light guides (10, 11, 12, 17, 36, 53) are each coupled to a said inclined face by a collimator/decollimator, and a layer of nematic liquid crystal material (21, 39, 41,...) is contained, at least at active regions, between the parallel faces of consecutive prisms (16, 34),  the assembly thereby forming a switching matrix switching optic signals selectively between input and output light guides in response to voltages applied to the active regions of the layers.   2. an electro-optical switching matrix according   te    claim 1 further characterised in that end-faces (80, 92) of prisms (95) not coupled to light guides are provided with light absorbers (75a, 76a).   3. an electro-optical switching matrix according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the angle   µ    lies between   7c    + 1 and   sic+7    where is the critical angle of total internal reflection for the prism/liquid crystal interface.   4. an electro-optical switching matrix according to any preceding claim in which polarisers (p13, p14, p15) are provided at the input light guides to pass only tm mode light.    5. an electro-optical switching matrix according to any preceding claim having an inactive region (138, fig.ll) between the parallel faces of consecutive prisms (117, 140) containing a liquid of similar refractive index to that of the prisms to permit light to pass through   undeviated.        6. an electro-optical switching matrix according to any preceding claim in which the crystal layer is of positive anisotropy nematic liquid crystal material and the outer faces of the prisms (117, -140) are provided with mirror surfaces (mll8,   my33)    to reflect light signals and cause them to emerge parallel to their original direction when the matrix is in the   'off'    state.
