<ABSTRACT>
multi-element gem stones and other display objects comprising pleochroic materials are provided which evidence enhanced colors or other unusual optical properties, based on the pleochroic behavior of the material.  doublet stones, comprised of two pleochroic material, and triplet stones, comprised of two pleochroic materials separated by an optical rotator, are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention 1. field of the invention this invention relates to gem stones and other display objects and, more particularly, to multiplet gem stones, such as doublets and triplets, which incorporate pleochroic materials. 2. description of the prior art many of the well-known gem minerals are pleo chroic. that is, a single piece of such a material will exhibit various colors, depending on the direction of viewing and/or the polarization direction of the illumina ting light. the fundamental effect is due to the polari zation direction of the light. the viewing angle dependence in unpolarized light arises due to the elimination of light polarized parallel to the viewing direction, since light waves are purely transverse excitations. such effects occur in non-cubic, optically uniaxial and biaxiai crystals due to the influence of the anisotropic host crystal structure on the transitions between electron energy levels of the impurity ions which give rise to the color. some well-known gem crystals which exhibit pleo chroism to a greater or lesser extent include alexandrite, andalusite, axinite, beryl, chrosoberyl, cordierite, emerald, epidot, kyanite, peridote, ruby, sinnalide, spodumene, tourmaline and zoisite. in the course of cutting crystals of these !tinerls to obtain faceted 3em stones, it is well-kr.own that one must often control the crystallographic orientation of the stone to stain the desired color in the finished gen stone, or alternatively, that the color of the finished gem may be varied to some extent by varying the crystallographic orientation. this is particularly important, for example, in the faceting of certain types of tourmaline which, if cut with the table (top) facet parallel to the "c" plane, may appear nearly opaque or ble--, while the same stone, if cut with the table facet perpendicular to the "c" plane, would exhibit a desirable blue or green color. similarly, certain cordierites may appear nearly colorless in certain orientations and deep blue in others. multiplex element gem stones have been used in the past for various purposes. for example, d'esposito in u.s. patent 1,745,607, issued february 4, 1930, describes doublet stones in which two components made of natural beryl are cemented together with a transparent cement incorporating an appropriate coloring agent so as to produce a composite stone exhibiting the color of emerald. in this case, the refractive properties of beryl, which resemble those of emerald, are combined with the color properties of the central colored film. other doublet constructions may combine the hardness properties of a material, such. as sapphire, with the refractive and dispersive properties of a soft material, such as strontium titanate, to produce a robust composite stone visually resembling a diamond. see, e.g., jones, u.s. patents 3,528,261 and 3,808,836, issued sept. 15, 1970 and may 7, 1974, respectively. or, a hard colorless cap may be used to mechanically protect a fragile but visually attractive stone such as opal. other attempts to alter or control the optical properties of gem stones have also been employed. for example, in highly doped natural or synthetic alexandrite, the daylight

we claim:    1. a multiple element transparent optical display object comprising a gem stone having at least two optically oriented elements of at least one pleochroic material, said oriented elements being either physically rotated with respect to each other over a range of about 200 to 1600 or separated by an optically active rotator material.    2. a multiple element transparent display object comprising at least two optically oriented elements of at least one pleochroic material, said oriented elements being either fixedly mounted with respect to each other such that one element is rotated with respect to the other by an angle ranging from about   20     to 160  or disposed in continuously variable rotational   configura.ion    with respect to each other.    3. a display object according to either of claims i and 2, in which said at least one pleochroic element is selected from alexandrite, andalusite, axinite, beryl, chrysoberyl, cordierite, dichroite, emerald, epidot, kyanite, peridot, ruby, sinhalite, spodumene, tourmaline or zoisite.    4. a display object according to any one of claims 1 to 3, comprising two elements of at least one pleochroic material physically rotated with respect to each other.    5. a display object according to claim 4, in which said two elements comprise alexandrite, each element containing chromium in the concentration range of about 0.005 to 1.0 atom percent substitution for aluminium, said elements being oriented substantially parallel to crystal planes which contain the "b" crystal direction and rotated with respect to each other over a range of about 200 to 1600.     6. a display object according to claim 4, in which one element comprises tourmaline oriented at right angles to the "c" plane and the second element comprises either "a" axis or "c" axis alexandrite.    7. a gem stone according to either of claims 1 and 3 comprising three elements, two of which comprise at least one pleochroic material  and the third an optically active rotator material interposed between said two elements.    8. a display object according to claim 2, additionally comprising an optically active rotator material disposed between said at least two elements.    9. a gem stone according to either of claims7 and 8, in which said rotator material comprises a-quartz.
