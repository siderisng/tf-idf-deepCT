<ABSTRACT>
fibrils of a thermoplastic polymer are produced.  a mixture  of the termoplastic and a liquid, e. g.  water and pentane or  hexane, flows through a valve from a high to a low pressure  zone.  the valve contains a spring biased closure member  which interrupts the flow when the pressure in the high pressure  zone is too low.  at low pressure the flow is unstable and  the formation of fibrils is unsatisfactory.  a preferred  apparatus takes the form of an extruder having a spring  loaded closure member on the die.  the spring stops the  extrusion when the pressure in the extruder is too low for  satisfactory flash evaporation.
