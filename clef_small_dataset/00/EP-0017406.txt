<ABSTRACT>
a postage meter has a printing mechanism positioned  on a drum (26), and a driving gear (22) for rotating the drum  (26) to imprint postage on an article, e. g.  a mailpiece.  the  driving gear (22) is adapted to be externally driven.  the  meter also has a shutter bar (21) engageable with the driving  gear, and an interposer, e. g.  pawl 30, is coupled to the  shutter bar (21) for inhibiting movement thereof.  an electro­ nic accounting system is also provided within the meter.  a  latch, which may be an interposer solenoid (47), is operative  in response to the operating voltage for inhibiting more than  a determined number of printing cycles.  a counting device is  incorporated to count printing cycles that were not reg­ istered, to thereby enable the electronic accounting system  to bring the printing data up to data in the event, for  example.  of restoration of power following a power failure.
