<ABSTRACT>
a portable carbonating apparatus of the type comprising  a pressure vessel (11) and a header tank (13) has a bottom inlet  (34) and a top outlet (38) controlled by respective valve pistons  (36, 39) which are rigidly connected together by a connecting  rod (40).  the pistons (36, 39) have equal areas exposed within the  pressure vessel, so as to be pressure balanced at all times.  the top valve piston (39) also acts to control opening and  closing of a venting port (44) to ensure venting of pressure  from a head space (42) during initial opening movement of the  valves.  the header tank is self-valved (19) and is detachable from  the apparatus.
