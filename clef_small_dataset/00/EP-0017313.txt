<ABSTRACT>
the invention is concerned with a method of constructÂ­ ing a lined tunnel using a tunnelling shield having a tail skin  and in which the tunnel lining is of the expanded type  comprising a number of ring sections(4) fitted together end  to end and in which each ring section (4) is formed from a  number of arcuate segments(5) which are fitted together  circumferentially and which are expanded radially into  contact with the surrounding ground(1).  the expansion may  be effected by means of one or more wedges which are  driven between pairs of the segments, or by jacks which are  expanded between segments.  in the method each ring  section(4) of the tunnel lining is erected by first assembling  its segments(5) to form the new ring section (4a) in an  unexpanded state within the tail skin(2) of the tunnelling  shield while a thin rear extension(3) of the tail skin(2)  overlaps the leading end of the previously erected and fully  expanded ring section(4b) and whereby an annular layer of  resilient compressible material(6) is located around the  newly assembled ring section(4a), the annular layer of  resilient compressible material(6) being formed by layers of  the material attached to the outer surfaces of the individual  segments(5).  the newly assembled ring section(4a) is then  pushed against the leading end face of the previously  erected ring section(4b) and is partially expanded so that the  layer of compressible material(6) is partially compressed  against the inside of the tail skin(2) and its extension(3) as  shown.  the tunnelling shield is then advanced until its thin  rear extension(3) overlaps the leading end of the new ring  section(4a), and the new ring section(4a) is then further  expanded until it reaches its fully expanded condition.
