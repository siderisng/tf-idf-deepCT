<ABSTRACT>
With the aid of this method, salts of the anthrachi nondisulfonic acid can be recovered from a washing liquid part current (13). The washing liquid comes from a laundry (3) for the separation of sulfur water material made of gas mixtures (1). The washing liquid is regenerated with the aid of an oxygen-rich gas (8) and under removal of elemental sulfur (10). For the discharge of undesirable reaction products, a partial flow (13) of the regenerated washing liquid is branched and introduced into a combustion stage (16). According to the invention, the salts of the anthraquinone disulfonic acid are retained in switchable adsorbers (14, 15) which are each filled with a pouring of macroporous adsorber resins, for example based on polystryrol. The adsorbers are regenerated with water or the alkali carbonate solution from the combustion (16). The solution thus obtained is returned to the laundry. The washing liquid (4) is typical of a stretchford laundry. It is an alkaline solution of alkali metal salts of anthraquinone disulfonic acid with addition of alkalimetavana dat.
