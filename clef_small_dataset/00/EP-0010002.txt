<ABSTRACT>
a planetary coiler (a) for strand material includes a  circular rotary stabilizing member (20), in which a rotary  coiler member (21) is eccentrically positioned, and drive  arrangements (86,45 and 85,38) connected to the coiler  member (21) for imparting rotation thereto and for moving  the same in an orbital path of travel so that the cooler  member (21) transmits rotation to the stabilizing plate  member (20) by virtue of the orbital path of movement of  the coiler member.
