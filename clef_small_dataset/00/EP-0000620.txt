<ABSTRACT>
a centrifugal spinning apparatus and process are pro­ vided for the manufacture of fibrils from a hot viscous hyd­ rocarbon solution of olefin polymers having an intrinsic vis­ cosity of at least 3. 5.  the apparatus consists of an impeller  (blades 42,44,46,48) which rotates at high speed in a cylindri­ cal cavity (30) having a discharge port (22).  the impeller has a  plurality of blades whose narrow dimensions lie substantially  in the plane of the impeller's rotation and whose tips come in  close proximity to the inner peripheral surface of the cylindri­ cal cavity.  the blades are arranged in at least two substantially  identical sets.  within each set, the blades are offset substan­ tially equidistant from one another, both in the rotational  plane of the impeller and in the plane transverse therto.  two  inlet ports (50,52) are provided in the, peripheral surface of the  cylindrical cavity to feed liquids to the cylindrical cavity, each  of which ports is narrow in a plane transverse to the plane of  the impeller's rotation and extends over substantially the  entire peripheral surface.  the inlet ports are positioned near  the discharge port of the cylindrical cavity and upstream  thereof viewed with respect to the impeller's rotation, so that  the bulk of the liquids entering the cavity from the inlet ports is  swept away from the discharge port by the impeller's rotation.
