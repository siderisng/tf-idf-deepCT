<ABSTRACT>
A solar sensor has a rigid frame and at least one seamless synthetic sheet with infra-red, stretched on this framework. The frame is carried out by means of a rigid profile which comes in the general form of a wide band which comprises along one of its longitudinal edges a shaped portion of U, (2), whose free branches are At least approximately parallel to the plane formed by one of the faces of the strip and several U-shaped portions, (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) whose free branches are perpendicular to Plan of the band. These last U-shaped portions have the lateral branches slightly curved inward at their free ends so as to form a strangulation arranged to cooperate with a first and a second movable rods longitudinally engaged in the opening of the U to lock it. One of the rods is subject to a voltage that solicits it through the strangulation formed by the free branches of the u. This locking device is used to extend the seamless synthetic sheet on the frame (2).
