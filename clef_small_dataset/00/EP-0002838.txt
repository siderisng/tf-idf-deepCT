<ABSTRACT>
a vibratory device operable as a two mass (14, 12)  vibrating system for driving a work member as used in  feeders, screens, conveyors and the like, employs a motor  driven eccentric weight exciter (34) attached to one mass  (14) which is spring (18) coupled to a second mass (12)  with the entire device being supported by isolator springs  (24).  the spring coupling (18) is adjustable in a generally  vertical plane to vary the direction of application of the  exciter forces transmitted from the first mass (14) to the  second mass (12) to fix this direction as conditions of use  call for, the second mass (12) being vibrated with the work  member forming a part of such second mass to perform  the work produced by the vibratory device in driving the  work member.  a d. c.  brush or brushless motor (30) is  particularly useful to drive the exciter for driving relatively  small work members to achieve ease of changing the rotative  speed of the eccentric weight exciter as conditions  dictate.
