<ABSTRACT>
coated abrasives comprising a sheet (1) of paper or fabric coated with abrasive particles in an adhesive binder are made more flexible and longer-lasting by applying the abrasive particles in the binder in an array of discrete dots (3) covering only part of the area of the sheet.  the performance of the product is further improved by the use of a backing sheet (2) of flexible synthetic foam material.  the products are sanding sheets which may be made into belts or discs for use on machines and tools, cleaning and polishing sheets, and dishwashing pads.
