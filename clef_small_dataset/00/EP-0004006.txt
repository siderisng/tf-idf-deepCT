<ABSTRACT>
1.  linear connector, especially consisting of plastic, for hollow profiled frame members of a multi-sheet insolating glass, comprising a longitudinal body (1), the cross-section of which is adapted to the cross-section of the cavity of two profiled frame members which are to be connected linearly, characterized in that the linear connector consists of two parts (a, b) of which the one part (a) can be inserted into the one profiled frame member and the other part (b) can be inserted into the other profiled frame member, and that the surfaces of these parts adjacent to the inner walls of the profiled frame members, which inner walls are carrying on their outer sides the two sheets of glass of the multi-sheet glass, are provided with spring members (5) which can be brought into frictional contact with those inner walls.
