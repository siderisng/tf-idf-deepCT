<ABSTRACT>
a method of editing signals such as audio frequency  signals representing musical or like programmes includes  representing the signal which is to be edited and another  signal which is to supersede part of the first signal in similar  digitally coded forms comprising discrete blocks of data sepaÂ­ rated by interblock spaces.  a synchronous cross-fade of the  signals is cued at an interblock space preceding the transition  between the signals.  a series of blocks of data representing  the second signal subsequent to the point of cueing and  encompassing the transition may be recorded in a store for  the purpose and read out for the cross-fade.

<DESCRIPTION>
"editing of programmes and other signals in digitally coded form" this invention principally relates to the editing of musical programmes or other audio signals which are in digitally coded form but may have a more general utility. the invention is intended to be particularly useful for the making of master recordings (usually on magnetic tape) for use in the multiple production of gramophone record discs or cassette tapes and it will be convenient to describe the invention in such a context, but the invention is not intended to be limited to such usage. as is well known, it is frequently necessary to edit recordings of music programmes and the like in order that, for example, passages containing faults may be displaced by corresponding passages, taken from other recordings ("takes"). it has been proposed to make master recordings in which the audio frequency signals ?re represented in digitally coded form, such as pulse code modulation, the-perspective quality of the recording being greater than if analogue signals are used throughout the recording process,# but to date there has been no convenient process# or apparatus for editing such a master recording. it is known to code signals digitally in a variety of forms each of which comprises blocks of data separated by. interblock spaces. generally speaking, each block comprises a plurality of digital words; the words may be in either serial or parallel.#form.. the present invention provides-, among other things, a method of editing an audio fre#quency signal, represented in a digitally coded form comprising discrete blocks of data separated by interblock spaces, by the insertion of a passage of another, similarly coded, signal, the method comprising selecting a time of transition between the two signals, recordigthe first signal up to an interblock space which is either selected to-be or precedes the transition, and- at said space cueing# a synchronous crossfade of the first signal and the second signal in a convenient form of#-the- invent#ion-, the second signal is replayed during a rehearsal of-the first sig#nal and a block or seri-es of blocks following the said interblock space and either immediately following or encompassing the point of transition is read into a store, and during a second playing of the first signal the contents of the store are read out for cross fading with the first signal. the cross-fading is conveniently performed by a digital cross-mixer which may be controlled by a counter in respect of the beginning of the cross-fade, which may occur at or a controllable time after the interblock space which marks the cueing point, and the - rate at which the cross-fade #roceeds. the duration of the insertion of the second signal is preferably controlled to terminate in a reversed cross-fade with the first signal. there follows a description of an apparatus suitable for performing the present invention and a method of performing it, reference hereinafter being made to the accompanying drawing. an original signal to be edited is received at a tenninal 1 and is converted into a

claims:    1. a method   of-editing    a signal which is represented in a digitally coded form comprising discrete blocks of data separated by interblock spaces#, by the insertion of a passage of. another, similarly coded signal, the method comprising selecting a time of transition between the two signals, and cueing a synchronous cross-fade of the two signals at an interblock space which is   either-selected    to be or precedes, the transition.    2. a method according to claim 1 in which the first signal is recorded at least up to the said interblock space.    3. a method according to claim 2 in which a block or series of blocks of the second signal follow.ing the said interblock space and encompassing the period of the intended cross-fade is read into a store and the contents of the store are read out for cross-fading with the first signal.
