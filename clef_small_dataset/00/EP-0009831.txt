<ABSTRACT>
On the cylindrical wall of the burner body are embedded openings for the passage of the combusti mixture, these openings being made in the form of slots (5) having a minimal width and a reduced length.These slots (5) are gathered into groups themselves divided into parallel subgroups, thus giving rise to flame fans having a single flame forehead vis-Ã -vis each group.It is thus reduced the noise caused by the burner at the same time as a great stability of the flame guarantees;The regularity of this flame is advantageous for both the operating uniformity and the burner efficiency.
