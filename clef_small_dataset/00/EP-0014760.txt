<ABSTRACT>
hammertool with a reciprocating piston member (35)  slideably positioned in a barrel (27) and moving between a  forward limit position and a rearward limit position.  an air  passageway (31) open to air is formed in the barrel (27) and a  first passageway (43) and a second passageway (41) are  formed in the piston member (35).  in the operational mode, a  ram (54) and the barrel (27) coact to alternately seal and  expose an enclosure (73) to the outside air through the first  passageway (43) and air passageway (31) whereby the ram  (54) is urged axially toward or away from the tool bit through  the pressure differentials established thereby in the enclosure  (73).  the second passageway (41) is formed in a forward  portion (39) and is spaced a predetermined distance away  from the first passageway (43) such that the second passageÂ­ way (41) communicates with the air passageway (31) to  ensure that air is supplied to the enclosure (73) during the  course of the movement of the piston member (35) from said  forward limit position to said rearward limit position when the  hammer tool is operating in the idle mode.  in this way, the ram  (54) remains inactive when the tool bit is removed or when the  tool is lifted from the work surface because no significant  pressure differentials are developed in the enclosure (73).
