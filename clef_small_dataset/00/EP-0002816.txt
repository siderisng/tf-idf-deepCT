<ABSTRACT>
a solar cell device has an acrylic plastic injection moulding (4) which has bulges, forming convex lenses (15) for the individual solar cells (1) on its outside and nest-like depressions (5), for receiving one solar cell in each case on its inside.  polyester plastic is poured into the nest-like depressions (5) and the solar cells (1), which are connected to one another in an electrically conducting manner are pressed into said polyester plastic, thereby defining their position and securing them without the risk of air inclusions at the front side of the cells.  such a solar cell device embodying solar cells (1) arranged honeycomb fashion in a very confined space can be used as a lid for a box for receiving storage and regulating units for the current produced, for example in the form of an electric fence device.  a solar generator is formed by arranging such solar cell devices next to one another on a common panel (17), the individual solar cell devices being pressed into the free surface of the plastic panel before curing and contact tabs (8) projecting from the underside of the panel (17).  <image>
