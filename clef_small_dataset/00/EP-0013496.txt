<ABSTRACT>
three resistors (16, 17, 18) connect a point (19) to the  output terminals of an alternator stator winding (10).  the said  point (19) is connected to the positive terminal of the battery  (12) through a resistor (20) and to its negative terminal  through a zener diode (34) and a resistor (35).  a pair of comÂ­ parators (21, 22) having their outputs connected to the base of  a darlington transistor (28, 30) detect if the voltage at the said  point (19) is outside a predetermined range.  the junction of  the zener diode (34) and its associated resistor (35) is also  connected to the base of the darlington transistor (28, 30).  a  waning lamp (32) connected in tho collector circuit of the  darlington transistor is energised if the alternator does not  produce an output or a malfunction occurs in the charging  system.
