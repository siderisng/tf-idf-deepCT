<ABSTRACT>
unbalanced/balanced converter circuit in which a first  circuit (t1, t2) of controllable impedance is connected  between a first supply terminal (earth) and a first balanced  terminal (a-leg), a second circuit (t3, t4) of controllable  impedance is connected between a second supply terminal  (-48v d. c. ) and a second belanced terminal (b-leg), and  a control circuit (r, r2, a1) is connected to monitor any  departure from balance of the potentials of the first and  second balanced input/output terminals and to simultaneously  change the impedances of the first and second circuits  (t1, t2 and t3, t4 resp. ) of controllable impedance  in opposite directions to restore the potentials to balance.   a first unbalanced terminal (x) is connected (via c6) to one  balanced terminal (a-leg) and a second unbalanced terminal  is connected to a common point (earth).  a principal use of the invention is balance/unbalanced  conversion of a subscriber's telephone line.
