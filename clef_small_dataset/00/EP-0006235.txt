<ABSTRACT>
In a suspended label for printing, from giving and attaching self-adhesive labels, with one - seen from the side - substantially quite angular, trapezoidal or parallelogram-like, provided with a handle housing (1) are between which preferably made of sheet steel, at a distance Held side walls (2, 3) a printing unit (5), a triggering device for a tie-feeder tensioning device, a deflecting device for the trier belt and a pressing device (6) for each at least partially separated from the carrier tape, in the spending label is arranged. In order to be able to give the metal housing (1) in technical and economic terms as favorable as possible, form rigid shaping and on the other hand to be able to optimally fulfill the claims to be set to a suspended labeling device with regard to aesthetics and convenient handling, each side wall (2, 3) of the housing (1) two opposite, par allele and free edges (14, 15), and about the outside rarely of each side wall (2, 3) are made of plastic best sheath walls (16, 17) can be slidable, which the Free edges (14, 15) of the side walls (2, 3) surround the flanges (18, 19).
