<ABSTRACT>
1.  hinge with two pairs of linkages, which are each hinged at one end to a base (5, 5'), by means of which the hinge can be fixed to the parts (6, 11) which are to be swivelled relative to one another, and which pairs of linkages are pivotally joined to one another in the form of a four-bar linkage, - the inner linkages (2, 2' ; 16, 17) crossing over and being pivotally joined to one another at the cross-over point, - the free ends of the outer linkage (1, 1' ; 18, 19) being hinged to one another, and - the free ends of the inner linkage (2, 2' ; 16, 17) being hinged, in the zone of the free ends of the outher linkages (1, 1' ; 18, 19), to the latter with the formation of a four-bar linkage, characterized in that - the distance between the hinge points (3, 4 ; 3', 4') on the base (5, 5') of each pair of linkages is smaller than the distance between the corresponding hinge points (7, 9  or 7, 10) on the opposite end of the connection, - the linkages (1, 2 ; 1', 2' ; 16, 19 ; 17, 18) each have two arms extending at an angle to one another, the bending points, located in the central zone, of each pair of linkage facing away from one another, and - at least one of the linkages (1, 2 ; 1', 2' ; 16, 19 ; 17, 18) is resiliently elastic or - at least one of the hinge points (3, 4 ; 3', 4' ; 7-10) is formed as a positive guide for a hinge pin (20) which is displaceable and rotatable in a slot (21).
