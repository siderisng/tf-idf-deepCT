<ABSTRACT>
in a system in which compressed ethylene is schedul­ ed to flow through pipes, and in which there is danger of  decomposition of ethylene and danger of the spreading of  a reaction boundary of the exothermic decomposition  reaction, a method and means are provided for quenching  the advancement of the decomposition.  ethylene is direct­ ed from large diameter pipes into an array of spaced apart  small diameter tubes (153) which are not overheated when  subjected to the combination of head and tail boundaries  of the advancing plug of decomposition products.  such  overheating of the tubes by the leading and trailing flames  can be prevented by cooling the exterior of the tubes with  a fluid normally maintained at about ambient temperature,  thereby cooling the compressed ethylene sufficiently to  quench the decomposition reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
reaction boundary suppressor systems technical field this invention relates to compressed ethylene and systems involving the piping of compressed ethylene along relatively great distances. in its broader aspects, it relates to reaction boundary suppressors in facilities in which a reaction boundary such as a flame front of an undesired reaction (initiated by an accident) has a propensity to migrate through a gas pipeline. the similar minimizing of the spreading of flames through a gas pipeline system is sometimes discussed in relation to the strategy of placement of flame arrestors. background art it has long been known that a saturated hydrocarbon gas, such as ethane, propane, or methane, could be compressed and transmitted through pipelines without significant problems other than the hazard of combustion by maintaining acetylene at about atmospheric pressure and quite pure, acetylene can be handled safely. at an early date, it was learned that acetylene was quite hazardous when compressed by reason of its propensity to undergo a decomposition the flame speed for such decomposition is greater that the speed of sound, thus classifying the reaction as a denotation instead of deflagration. the early discovery of the violence of the detonation of compressed acetylene resulted in municipal ordinances prohibiting systems using compressed acetylene. compressed ethylene is neither as safe as compressed ethane nor as dangerous as compressed acetylene. it has been known that a decomposition reaction could advance throughout a great length of a pipe containing compressed ethylene. the temperature of the spontaneously advancing decompostion reaction is hot enough to cause blistering of paint on the external surface of a pipe in which compressed ethylene decomposes to a mixture comprising soot, carbon, minor amounts of hydrogen, minor amounts of miscellaneous hydrocarbon, and a molar amount of methane approximately equal to the initial ethylene. the speed of the flame is quite low, eliminating the detonation hazard but permitting explosions of vessels unable to withstand the pressures built up by the decomposition reaction. the build-up of pressure is attributable primarily to the increased temperature of the gas mixture, instead of the conventional volume increasing reaction. because piping for compressed ethylene is built with an adequate safety feature, it is conceivable that the decomposition reaction boundary might move through a pipe form a very considerable distance without any explosion and even without any rupture of the pipe. the amount of cooling necessary for quenching an accidental reaction is affected by many factors, including flame speed, exothermicity of the reaction, magnitude of gas compression, pipe diameter, single or multiple flames, and related factors. heretofore, most flame arrestors have had a cooling capacity which is only a small fraction of the coiling capacity necessary to quench the forward and trailing reaction boundaries for the decomposition of ethylene at 100 atmospheres in a pipeline of about 30 cm diameter. because accidents sometimes involve hazards which had not been predicted, there has been a long standing demand for flame arrestors having an adequate safety margin as regards cooling capacity sufficient to quench a reaction. in
