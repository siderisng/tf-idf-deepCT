<ABSTRACT>
1.  a device for the manufacture of collar members flanged internally or externally by longitudinal rolling of one of the flanges of an l-section, the device comprising at least one press having a plurality of rolls which may possibly be frustoconical and have line contact with the l-section which is to be rolled and which are driven in order to roll one flange of the said l-section and have at the ends of the rolls gaps for the other flange of the l-section to pass through, characterized in that the l-section (8e, 8f) is obtained by profiling a strip (2) in a profiling train (4, 5, 6, 7) and in that the bending press (10) for obtaining an internal flange and the curving press (20) for obtaining an external flange include for the bending or curving of the l-section (8e, 8f) only two rolls (11, 12) and (21, 22) in which firstly the lines of contact of the rolls (11, 12) form with one another an angle of form 0. 1 to 3 degrees whilst the gap at the end of the rolls (11, 12) for the other flange (8e) of the l-section to pass through is provided on that side at which the lines of contact are not furthest separated from one another, and secondly the lines of contact of the rolls (21, 22) form with one another an angle of from 0. 1 to 3 degrees whilst the gap at the end of the rolls (21, 22) for the other flange (8f) of the l-section to pass through is provided on that side at which the lines of contact are furthest separated from one another, and in that the positions of entry of the l-section into the bending press (10) and into the curving press (20) are identical.
