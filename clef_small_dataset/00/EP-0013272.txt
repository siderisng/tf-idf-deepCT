<ABSTRACT>
an improved helicopter designed to create minimum  drag and turbulence in which the main rotor pylon 26 has a top  surface 36 having a forward portion 36a defining the rotor  head well aperture so as to have a selectively curved lip on the  rearward side thereof to eliminate flow separation therefrom  of the air being discharged rearwardly from the rotor head  well, further having a central portion 36b curving slightly  away from the direction of helicopter flight and including a  laterally extending boundary layer slot a selected distance  downstream of the curved lip through which fluid is expelled  substantially parallel to the direction of helicopter flight to  energize the surface flow along the pylon top surface, further  having a rear portion 36c at a lower elevation extending  approximately in the direction of helicopter flight, and having  engine and other exhaust ports positioned a selected distance  downstream of the boundary layer control slot through which  the exhaust fluids are directed over the rear portion in a  direction substantially parallel to the direction of helicopter  flight, and terminating in a sharp lip 52 to separate the exhaust  flow from the pylon surface thereat.
