<ABSTRACT>
articles, particularly meat articles, are loaded into  containers from apparatus which comprises two groups  of beams (5, 7, 9, 11) and (13, 15, 17) cantilevered in a  direction of article progression.  the beams are moved to  give a lifting and advancing action to the article.  the movement  of the movable beams is synchronised to provide for  article movement in the desired direction.  the terminal  portions of both sets of beams are unconnected and  spaced apart so as to provide a spaced relationship between  the group of beams to permit the insertion of a container  over the terminal portions of the beams.  one embodiment has both sets of beams rotatably  moved for horizontal and vertical movement with the  movement out of phase so that the article is advanced  by one set of beams (51) while the other set (53) retreats.   alternatively one set (51 or 53) may be stationary while the  other set moves rotatably.  thirdly one set (5, 7, 9, 11) may  reciprocate horizontally while the other set (13, 15, 17)  reciprocates in a vertical direction.
