<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for producing 2-amino arylothiazoles which may be substitu in the 2-permanent amino group by aryl, alkyl and / or cycloalkyl radicals as well as 2-imino-arylothiazolin compounds which are Ring nitrogen atom is substituted by aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl radicals. The preparation of these compounds is carried out analogously known methods by cyclization from the respective nitrogen atoms according to substituted arylthiohemreas. According to the invention, thionyl chloride is used as cyclizing agent; Hereby, a method improvement is achieved in such a way that in particular the accumulation of the sulfur formed is very low and the remaining by-products are easily removable and further usable. After improved procedures, the thiazoles and thiazoline are obtained in high yield and purity. They serve as starting connections, in particular for the production of dyes.
