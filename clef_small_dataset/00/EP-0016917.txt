<ABSTRACT>
polyphosphazene polymers are prepared which con­ tain units represented by the formulas:    in which r is an alkylene radical containing from 0 to 10  carbon atoms, r′ is hydrogen or alkyl containing from 1 to  10 carbon atoms and n is an integer of from 0 to 10; where­ in x′ ist x or is selected from the group consisting of sub­ stituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, aryloxy, amino and mer­ capto groups and wherein 20 ≦ (a + b + c) ≦ 50,000 per  polymer.  the polymers of the invention can be utilized to form  films and may also be utilized in applications such as mold­ ings, coatings, foams and the like.
