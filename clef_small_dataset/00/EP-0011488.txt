<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a heat bonded paper web com­ prising cellulosic fibres, synthetic thermoplastic fibres and a  resinous additive.  it has been found that the tear strength,  tensile strength and stretch properties of the heat bonded  web are improved by adding a resinous additive to the paper  before heat bonding.  paper according to the invention is par­ ticularly suitable for base paper for book binding.

<DESCRIPTION>
heat bonded paper this invention relates to heat-bonded paper webs made from a blend of natural cellulosic fibres and synthetic thermoplastic fibres. paper webs have traditionally been formed from cellulosic fibres derived from various materials of vegetable origin, for example woodpulp. where it is desirable for the web to be susceptible to heat treatment, it has been proposed to incorporate a proportion of synthetic thermoplastic fibres in the web. originally, chopped staple fibres were proposed for this purpose. however, such fibres are unfibrillated and incapable of hydrogen bonding, and thus they are inherently unsuited to the production of strong paper webs. with the exception of one or two speciality products therefore, the inclusion of chopped staple fibres in paper webs has not been widespread. in recent years, so-called synthetic woodpulp fibres have become available. these fibres are produced specially for use in papermaking, and have a gross morphology (i.e. length: diameter ratio) and diameter of the same order of magnitude as cellulosic papermaking fibres derived from woodpulp. they also resemble cellulosic fibres in being fibrillated to a considerable extent, and they thus permit stronger webs to be obtained than is the case with chopped staple fibres. examples of commercially-available synthetic woodpulps are "sip" supplied by crown zellerbach, "pulpex" supplied by solvay, and "ferlosa" supplied by montedison, all of which are polyethylenic. fibres of other polyolefins may be used. although synthetic woodpulp fibres produce reasonably strong paper webs when blended with cellulosic fibres, it is frequenulg desirable to heat the web after it has becn made to softell tbe th±-'ioplastic material and thus to enhance the strength of the web by increasing the extent of interfibre bonding. it has now surprisingly been found that the tear strength, tensile strength and stretch properties of a heat-bonded paper web made from a blend of cellulose fibres and synthetic thermoplastic fibres may be considerably enhancedby including a resinous additive in the paper web before heat bonding. according to the invention therefore, there is provided a heat-bonded paper web comprising cellulosic fibres and synthetic thermoplastic fibres characterised in that the web also contains a resinous additive. the resinous additive may be a synthetic or a natural material. an example of a suitable natural resin is rosin. suitable synthetic resins include materials sold as wetstrength resins for paper, for example aminoplast resins such as melamine formaldehyde resin and urea formaldehyde resin. melamine formaldehyde resin is particularly preferred (in this specification, the expression "resin"comprehends not only polymers having a large number of repeating units, but also so-called prepolymers or pre-condensates which have only a relatively small number of repeating units). other materials which may be used include polyamine resins, such as epichlorohydrin-modified polyamine or polyamidepolyamine resins, polyethylene imine resins, and the resins sold as "kymene" by hercules powder company and 1,nopcobond" by diamond shamrock corporation. the amount of resinous additive to be used is of the order of a few per cent, based on the total weight of the paper. above a certain 7c. addition, the improvement
