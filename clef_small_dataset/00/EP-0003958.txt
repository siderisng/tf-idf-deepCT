<ABSTRACT>
Measurement devices each provide a measured value (M₁.,, MX) for a property of the measuring fluid. From certain measured values, auxiliary values ​​(H₁.,, HU) are formed. Each auxiliary value is compared with a threshold (S₁.,, SU) compared to a recognition signal (K₁.,, KU). The individual recognition signals are summarized to a detection data word (DK); Each treatment state is a processing data word (DA₁.,, DAN); The calibration state corresponds to a calibration data word (DE). The recognition data word is compared with the other data words; Upon mood, a corresponding control signal (ST₁.,, STE) is generated. This is fed to a computer (R) to trigger a calculation corresponding to the treatment state or calibration. For example, in a diluted blood sample, the erythrocyte concentration (M₁), the hemoglobin content (M₂) and the conductivity (M₃) are measured and used as auxiliary values ​​(H₁, H₂, H₃). Depending on the result of the comparison of these assays with associated thresholds (S₁, S₂, S₃), a control signal (ST₁, ST₂, ST₃) is generated which triggers the associated calculation of the erythrocyte concentration or the hemoglobin content in the blood sample or the calibration of this calculation . The invention is preferably used in hematological analyzes and more generally in row analyzes of liquids.
