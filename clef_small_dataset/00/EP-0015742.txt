<ABSTRACT>
a multi-stage, wet steam turbine employs steam in its  two-phase region with vapor and liquid occurring simultane­ ously for at least part of the cycle, in particular the nozzle ex­ pansion stages (at 32 and 58).  a smaller number of stages than  usual is made possible, and the turbine may handle liquid only.   furthermore, simple construction, low fuel consumption and  high reliability are achieved.  rotor (24) has rings of vanes (42,  68, 85 and 81).  vanes (42 and 85) receive liquid, or steam and  liquid mixture, and vanes (68 and 81) steam to drive the rotor.   steam exhausting through the vanes (68) enters a recupera­ tive zone (66) to which feed water droplets are pumped by a  tesla pump (60) from the condenser (cc), and the heated wa­ ter thus formed is scooped up (at 70) and returned to the boil­ er (bb).  any steam exiting the zone (66) passes to the nozzles  (58).  rings of water, maintained by the vanes (42 and 85) exit  nozzles (47 and 89) to assist in driving the rotor.  these rings  form further rings (56, 91) of water rotating with a freely rotat­ able rotor (25) surrounding the turbine rotor.  a scoop (57) re­ moves water from the ring (56) and supplies it to the ring of  nozzles (58).  water from ring (91) is removed to the pump (60).
