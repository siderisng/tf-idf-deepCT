<ABSTRACT>
an adjustment device for the flushing valve (12) of a  control valve unit a so called "sifonic" type, controlling the  flushing of the water from a flushing tank into the flushing  pipe connected to a water closet bowl or like sanitary  appliances, permitting a valve control unit to be mounted in  flushing tanks of different sizes and designs.

<DESCRIPTION>
an adjustment device for the valve controlling the water flushing front, a flushing tank for water closet tbe present invention reates to an adjustment device for the valve unit of the so called "sifonic" type, designed to control the water flushing from a flushing tank into a flushing pipe connected to a water closet boil or like sanitary appliances so as to permit said valve unit to be mounted in flushing tanks of different sizes and designs. up to the date the manufacturers have always constructed flushing tanks provided wtfl. flushing valve units which could be replaced only by other similar units, each adapted only for a predetermined type of flushing tank. as a result thereof for replacement purposes the plumbers must have at their disposal different types of flushing valve units adapted for the various types of the different flushing tanks on the market. the present invention aims to overcome said inconveniences providing an adjustment device to enable a flushing valve unit of the "sifonic" type to be mounted in which-ever flushing tank. "or or such a purpose tis invention provides to connect, in an adjustable manner, the rod carrying the valve body previded to close the inlet orifice of the flushing pipe which is connected to the water closet bowl or like sanitary appliance, to a control tubular bar so as to obtain a valve control member of an adjustable length, this connection being effective only in the raising direction of the valve rod, so that, on the contrary, this latter can freely slide along said tubular bar, as this bar is returned in its sower end position. the tub@lar @ar at its upper end is guided by a sleeve made tegral . a cross oar or yoke r.e:nber which is frictionally slidably mounted on and supported by two vertical posts, but which can be locked to these posts @y looking means, in releasable manner, at the desired height therecf, one of the two posts being constituted of a tube so as to be able to be use as overflow pipe which is put in communication with the flushing pipe downstream of the seat of the flushing valve, which is of the well known type, made of an elastomeric material or rubber so as to be elastically deformable and which has a substantially spherical shape. the reans for locking yoke to its supporting posts are such that the locking operation does not require the use cf any tool. the adjustment device of this invention is very simple tre construction as ell as in the use and it is such as to last long, even if during the use of this device it will l remain at least partially always soaked inside the water with which the flushing tank is filled. the device of this invention can be mounted in various types of flushing tanks by means of simple adjustment operations which can be performed by any skilled worker also not very skilled in the art. these and other
