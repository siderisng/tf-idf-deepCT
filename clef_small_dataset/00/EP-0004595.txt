<ABSTRACT>
1.  controllable valve for a fire extinguishing system, comprising a valve body (1) for connection to a feed pipe (22) containing a fire extinguishing agent under pressure, and to a fire extinguishing agent outlet pipe (18) and which at the end opposite to the fire extinguishing agent feed pipe (22) is sealed by a cover (2) in which is provided a drilling (11) closed by a perforating disc (12) arranged on the side of the cover (2) for relieving the pressure in the valve body inner chamber (8) and which in the valve body inner chamber (8) contains a displaceable valve piston (3) for closing the fire extinguishing agent feed pipe (22) and for allowing the fire extinguishing agent to flow out of the fire extinguishing agent outlet pipe (18), which has a smaller diameter at its end facing the fire extinguishing agent feed pipe (22) than at its end facing the cover (2), which has a small drilling (3a) for the slow pressure equalization between its front and rear end and which has an outlet drilling (4) on the side of the valve body (1) for connection to the fire extinguishing agent outlet pipe (18) which outlet drilling (4) is so arranged that during closure of the extinguishing agent feed pipe (22) by the valve piston (3) this outlet drilling 4 is also closed, characterised in that the valve body (1) is constructed from a metal pipe, in that the opening (4) serving as the connection for the fire extinguishing agent outlet pipe (18) is arranged in the form of a conical outlet bore in the wall of the metal pipe and that in the open condition of the valve the valve piston (3) is arranged at a distance from the rest position which is greater than the diameter of the outlet drilling (4), the valve piston (3) thereby being arranged completely outside the flow path.
