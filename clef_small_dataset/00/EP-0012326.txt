<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to a method of electroplating a  film of iron-nickel alloy onto an article having a complex  shape.  this method provides a uniform iron-nickel ratio in  the film across the entire plating surface of the article.  it is  desirable to use a low value of fe and ni ion  concentrations and a relatively low current density to ope­ rate at the relatively flat peak of the curve of the iron per­ centage in the plated alloy vs.  current density curve.  the  curve can be raised or lowered by increasing or decreas­ ing the total dischargeable ion concentration respectively  for a given ni /fe ion ratio.  the preferred  fe ion concentration range for ni:fe alloy ratio near  80. 20 is about 0. 15 - 0. 3 g/l for a range of 10 - 14 g/l of  ni ion in a solution with a ph of about 3, a temperatu­ re of about 20 - 35°c where the na /fe ratio in  the solution ranges from about 45 to 1 to about 70 to 1.   preferably, an electrolyte for reducing pitting such as  0 - 100 g/l of nacl is employed.  the cation (na ) of the  latter electrolyte should not be a dischargeable ion.  plating  current density is preferably between about 2 ma/cm² and  12 ma/cm², and optimum results are achieved for values  from about 4 to 8 ma/cm².

<DESCRIPTION>
a method of electroplating nickel-iron alloys this invention relates to a method of electroplating nickel-iron alloys onto an article. thin films of approximately 80:20 ni:fe alloy composition commonly known as permalloy alloy have low coercivity and high permeability. those qualities make such films highly suitable for use in magnetic switching, recording heads and memory devices. we have discovered that devices with complex topographical shapes made by plating with previously known baths exhibit a substantial gradient in the nickel/iron composition ratio from point to point within a device. we have also discovered that the gradients result from the variations in current densities from point topoint across the topography of an object being plated which has such a complex shape. for objects such as magnetic pole pieces for magnetic recording heads employed in high density, high speed magnetic recording for data processing systems and the like, uniformity of quality is critical. substantial variation from uniformity of composition of ni:fe 80:20 alloys is undesirable. for example it can produce magnetostrictive alloys with high coercivity which can be unsatisfactory for use in products which require low coercivity. a substantial gradient of the ni:fe composition ratio along the surface of a magnetic recording head element significantly affects magnetic recording performance of the head adversely. a variation in current density from point to point along the surface of a head during an electroplating operation has been found to be very significant in its effect of varying uniformity of the composition ratio of plated films. it is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide a nickel-iron electrodeposition process operable with a plating current of a low current density for plating a film which provides a minimal gradient of the composition ratio of nickel to iron along a complex surface. electrodeposition of nickel-iron thin films has long been known using an aqueous solution of nickel and ferrous sulfamates, sulfates and chlorides. in a plating bath the ratio of the nickel ion concentration to the ferrous ion concentration has generally been above 30 to 1, the ph has been within the range between 2 and 3.5, and the solution temperature has been maintained below 300c. the current density has been maintained generally above 10 milliamps per square centimetre of cathode area. for example, u.s. patent 3,027,309 discloses the deposition of a nickel iron composition using a solution of nickel and ferrous sulfamates with a ratio of nickel to iron concentration to ferrous iron concentration of between 35 to 1 and 40 to 1 with a ph of between 2 and 3.5. the extremely high nickel ion concentration is stated as 113 g/l, and the ferrous ion concentration is 2.82 g/l. the solution temperature is maintained below 300c and, after a striking current, a deposition current density is maintained at approximately 10 milliamps per square centimetre of cathode area. another u.s. patent 3,317,410 discloses an electrodeposition system for nickel-iron alloys using a chloride metal salt solution containing boric acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium saccharin. the operating
