<ABSTRACT>
the printing apparatus disclosed herein and method  of the present invention generates alphanumeric characters  of high quality, using a multi-pin printing head (11) capable  of forming discrete dots or pels, by controlling the  actuation of the printing head with a timing resolution which  is an order of magnitude finer than the nominal dot diameter  so that a line smoothness for slanted or curved lines  is obtained which is greater than that obtainable by a  uniform matrix.  the printing head (11) is repeatedly traversed  or scanned across the paper to provide essentially  parallel lines of scan separated vertically by a distance  which is a submultiple of the vertical spacing of the pins  so that overlapping dots may be provided in the vertical  dimension.  by these means the apparatus facilitates the  formation of smooth lines of essentially arbitrary slope or  curvature.
