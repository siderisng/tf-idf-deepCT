<ABSTRACT>
1.  slide projector with an arrangement for moving the slide holders from a standard-projector-magazine (3) into the watching position behind a lense-optic (8) whereby the magazine is located and guided with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to the optical axis on the side of the slide projector opposite to the side of the operator, and whereby the slide holders perform a pivoting movement, characterized in that a translatory transporting device (10) is provided capable of drawing out a slide holder (5) in sideward direction from the magazine, that a plate-like slide-holder-receiver (60) is provided positioned in the same vertical plane as the slide holder (5) drawn out from the magazine and receiving this slide holder (5) by the sideward drawing movement, that the slide-holder-receiver (60) is carried only by a horizontal bearing axle (62) rigidly connected to the slide-holder-receiver (60), extending parallel to the plane of the slide-holder-receiver (60) and protruding from the slide-holder-receiver (60) toward the side of the operator, that the bearing axle (62) is pivotally journaled in a vertical column (30), which column is pivotally journaled on its part around its longitudinal axis (34), and that within a swinging range of less than 90 degrees around the axis (34) of the column (30) a lift catch is arranged provided with an upper horizontal plane (12 in figure 4) that is positioned such a distance (e) lower than the bearing axle of the slide-holder-receiver, that a swinging the slide-holder-receiver around the axis (34) of the column (30) the lift catch will turn the slide-holder-receiver around its bearing axle (62) into the horizontal plane.
