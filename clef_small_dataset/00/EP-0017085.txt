<ABSTRACT>
In a method for electrolytic separation of metals, such as copper, in which at the beginning of the electrolyte deposition of cathode sheets, in particular thin start cathode sheets, are used between anodes in an electrolyte, the cathode sheets in the electrolyte are fixed spatially. Due to the spatial fixation in contrast to known line fixation by clamping the edges, it is achieved that a thin cathode can not perform a movement that would result in a concern of parts of the cathode to the anode. It is provided that the spatial fixation takes place by determining individual points or small areas of the cathode surface. In the embodiment of the method is provided that the fixation of the cathode sheets (8) is carried out by an indirect support of the cathode plates (8) to the anodes (12). For support, fixing elements (6.7) are used between the anode and cathode. They form together with holding elements (14) fixing devices. The fixing devices are removed after depositing a predetermined metal layer thickness, which guarantees a self-stitching of the cathode (8).
