<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a bag convertible from a hand held  form to a shoulder supported form.  the bag comprises a  bag body (10) and a carrier (12) in the form of a closed loop.   the carrier includes a pair of handle segments (12a, 12b)  and a pair of flexible support segments (12c, 12d) adjoining  the handle segments (12a, 12b) in alternating end-to-end  relation.  the support segments (12c, 12d) are slidably carried  by the bag body (10) for movement of the carrier (12)  between a first position in which the handle segments (12a,  12b) are retained in relatively close proximity to the bag  body (10) and a second position in which the handle segments  (12a, 12b) may be extended upwardly from the first  position.
