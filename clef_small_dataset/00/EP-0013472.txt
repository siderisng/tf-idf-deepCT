<ABSTRACT>
a cover (14) for a recording disk (12) having non-­ magnetic recordings thereon is formed from two shoets of  non-magnetisable material superimposed and joined  together to form a container with an opening for receiving and  covering a recording disk.  an element of magnetisable mater­ ial is attached to one sheet adjacent to the opening for use in  enlarging the opening.  the cover and recording disk are for use in a record player  having a playing station including reading means arranged to  read the non-magnetic recordings on the disk.  the disk, in its  cover, is inserted into the player and when the disk reaches  the playing station a permanent magnet (49) attracts the  magnetisable element in the cover and enlarges the opening  in the cover.  a clamp operates within the enlarged opening to  hold the disk in position in the playing station while the cover  is removed.  when the cover is reinserted into the player to cover the  disk, a second permanent magnet (63) attracts the magnetis­ able element and opens up the cover to allow it to be inserted  over the disk.
