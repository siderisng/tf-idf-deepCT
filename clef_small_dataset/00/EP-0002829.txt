<ABSTRACT>
Method and means for the energetic utilization of the in-depth waters, in particular in the sea, prevailing pressure and / or temperature ratios. For this purpose, in a container whose content is influenced by the respective outer pressure and / or by the respective ambient temperature, a bypressure and / or temperature effect its physical state, in particular its aggregate state and / or its volume, changing medium, preferably a first liquid gas, recessed to a depth of the water (3), in which substantially different pressure and / or temperature ratios prevail with respect to the atmosphere located outside the water (3), which is the medium, preferably under change of its aggregate state, to a high depth A lead to a connecting line (6), preferably to a similar container (5), preferably to a similar container (5), in which the flow energy of the high-passing medium is preferably recalled mechanically. As a medium, a medium evaporating with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure is used in a gaseous aggregate state medium. The used a container, for receiving a liquid or gaseous medium, is lockable and floating through a control valve and is connected to the same, also closable second container by a connecting line (6, 9, 14) in which an energy converter (7) for the energetic utilization of each of which is arranged on the other container flow of the medium.
