<ABSTRACT>
pump drive assembly for liquid metal cooled fast breed­ er reactors which provides cooling of the core even after  a failure of the pump drive.  a pony (auxiliary) motor (14)  is mechanically coupled to the pump (10) at the preselet­ ed velocity by an overrun clutch (16) and drives the pump  (10) although at substantially reduced speed.  a flywheel  (20) may be associated with the pony motor (14) for pro­ longed final coastdown, which is particularly beneficial in  the event of loss of electrical power to the pony motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
pump drive assembly for liquid metal reactor the invention described herein was made in the course of, or under, a contract with the united states department of energy. this invention relates to primary pumping systems for liquid metal cooled breeder reactors, and more particularly provides arrangements for selectively controlling pump coastdown characteristics. fast breeder nuclear reactors typically circulate a coolant through a reactor vessel containing a core of nuclear fuel and shield assemblies and other components which support the assemblies and monitor and control core characteristics. coolant flows, for example, upwardly through the core, absorbing heat energy, then flows about the other in-vessel components above the core, is discharged from the vessel and flows through a heat exchanger, giving up heat energy typically for the ultimate purpose of electric power generation, and is pumped by primary system pumps back into the reactor vessel, completing the circuit. in the case of liquid metal cooled fast reactors, the temperature differences between the vessel inlet and outlet are relatively large, as compared to other liquid cooled reactor types, being on the order of l220c to l480c. this large temperature differential places severe design restrictions on reactor systems and components which must accommodate thermal transients resulting from, among other conditions, reactor shutdown. in order to shut down the reactor either during normal operation or under abnormal conditions such as loss of electrical power to the primary pumps, control means such as neutron absorbing rods are inserted into the core, and the electrically driven primary coolant pumps are deenergized. the pumps coastdown to a low speed at which time a pony motor associated with each primary pump engages the pump through an overrunning clutch. the pony motors are continuously running during reactor operation, and are engaged to prolong the total forced flow period so as to provide adequate decay heat removal from core components. the pony motors are powered by the plant ac electrical system, which also powers the primary pumps, and are also provided with numerous backup electrical power sources such as diesel-generators or batteries. should the normal and back-up sources of electrical power not be available, decay heat removal is accomplished by natural circulation cooling. the primary pumps are deenergized, or 1,tripped!?, to mitigate the thermal transients resulting from the abrupt reduction in the core-power- to-coolant- flow ratio caused by the reactor core shut down. the rate at which the coolant flow coasts down is a function of the kinetic energy in the rotating primary pumps prior to deenergization. in the past, the selection of kinetic energy requirements for the primary pumps has represented a difficult compromise between two competing considerations. in the first instance, a large pump rotating inertia provides a relatively prolonged coastdown. this long coastdown period assures adequate decay heat removal from the core components, including fuel, blanket and control assemblies, even in the unlikely event of loss of ac power to the reactor plant and simultaneous failure of the active backup battery or diesel system. the point in time

<CLAIMS>
what we claim is:    1. a pump drive assembly for the coolant pump of a liquid metal cooled breeder nuclear reactor having a main drive motor coupled to the pump for operating said pump at a predetermined operating speed and auxiliary drive means associated with said pump for operating said pump upon failure of said main drive motor characterized in that said auxiliary drive means is a pony motor (14) connectable to said pump (10) by an overrun clutch (16) operated by said pony motor (14) at a preselected second speed substantially below said operating speed and operatively connecting said pony motor (14) to said pump (10) when said pump (10) reaches said preselected speed.    2. a pump drive assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that a flywheel (20) is associated with said pony motor (14) so as to extend coastdown time of said pump (10) from said second speed to stand-still.     3. a pump drive assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a speed reduction gear assembly (24) is disposed between said pony motor (14) and said clutch (16), said pony motor (14) and associated flywheel (20) operating at a relatively high speed, the transmission ratio of said gear assembly (24) being such that the input to said overrunning clutch (16) from said pony motor (14) is at said second speed.    4. a pump drive assembly as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized by a back-up power supply (18) for said pony motor (14).    5. a pump drive assembly as claimed in any of  claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said preselected second pump speed is such that the pump flow rate is at about 10% of the pump operating speed flow rate.
