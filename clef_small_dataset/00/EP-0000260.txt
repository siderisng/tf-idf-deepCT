<ABSTRACT>
dry compactible, swellable herbicidal compositions and  pellets produced therefrom and use thereof.  the herbicidal composition consists essentially of 5-25%  by weight of a herbicide which is bromacil, diuron,  bromacil-diuron complex, 3-cyclohexyl-6-  (dimethylamino)-1- methyl-s-triazine -2,h(1h, 3h)- dione,  karbutilate, tebuthiuron, n-[4, 6-dimethoxy- 1, 3, 5 triazine  2-yl) aminocarbonyl]benzene sulfonamide or a mixture of  two or more thereof, 20 to 60% by weight of swelling bentonite,  5 to 15% by weight of anhydrous sodium sulfate, 10 to  25% by weight of urea, 2 to 10% by weight of polyethylene  glycol having a weight-average molecular weight of from  200 to 600 and 1 to 12% by weight of water, and optionally a  die release agent and/or an inert diluent.  the composition  can be dry compacted into a herbicidal pellet which is resistant  to impact and crushing and which swells and disintegrates  when contacted with small amounts of liquid water to  release the herbicidal compound.  the pellet can provide  selective control of undesirable brush in rangeland and  woodland areas.
