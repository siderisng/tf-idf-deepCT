<ABSTRACT>
the invention is an agricultural mouldboard formed from  a steel containing sulphur or sulphides into which there has  been incorporated sufficient of a rare earth element or ele足 ments or at least one other sulphide shape modifying element  to form sulphides or substantially globular form.  a particu足 larly useful steel has a composition, by weight, substantially  as follows:   0. 6 to 1. 2% carbon:   up to 0. 35% silicon;   up to 0. 02% sulphur;   up to 0. 05% phosphorus;   0. 5 to 1. 5% manganese;   up to 1. 0% chromium;   up to 0. 10% rare earth element or other sulphide shape mod足 ifying element.  the mouldboard is made by gradually and uniformly  heating a blank of the modified steel in a furnace to a tempera足 ture whereat it can be formed, forming said blank into the  desired mouldboard shape, and quenching the thus formed  article.

<DESCRIPTION>
@@@@icultural mduldboards'. this invention relates to mouldboards for tractor ,:gh high bodies. for many years such mouldboards have been manufactured ;m three-ply iron and steel, i.e. two sheets of steel with an iron sheet sandwiched between. the reason for using r s three-ply iron and steel, which is produced by hot ,nest rolling, is to resist wear and breakage. the mouldboard is part of a plough body, and works by lifting the furrow slice, the mouldboard contour turn ing the slice sideways and laying it against a similarly turned slice of a previously made furrow. the mouldboard has the abrasion of the soil against it, both back and front, although more so with the front. this action of the mouldboard passing through the soil causes it to wear. in addition to this it can encounter a variety of objects creating a danger of breakage or fracture. it is, therefore, necessary that mouldboards be mae from a material that will resist wear and breakage. common manufacturing practice is to use three-ply iron and steel, and harden the steel outer surface followed by fine finishing of the working face. this produces the advantage of the outer surfaces being wear resistant and the support given by the soft iron core being resistant to breakage or fracture. it should, however, be noted that when working, random chipping around the edges of the mouldboard is quite possible, but this ordinarily does not impair the mouldboard's function. what is desirable in a mouldboard is the avoidance of a "stranght-line" fracture, which in the case of an all steel mouldboard would result from directional grain flow of the steel from which the component is made. any such "straight-line" fracture would render the mouldboard useless, and the machine would have to be stopped and the mouldboard replaced. the object of this invention is to prob an ajl- -steel mouldboard which is not liable to such breakage as would render the mouldboard useless, and which has reasonabwc wear resistance, so that a set of assembled r,ouldboards on plough will give a consistent performance and avoid the problem of replacing individual mouldboards whilst the plough is in operation. according to the present invention a mouldboard is formed from a steel containing sulphur or sulphides into which there has been incorporated sufficient rare earth elements or other sulphide shape modifying elements to form sulphides of substantially globular form. further according to the invention, a method for the manufacture of a mouldboard comprises gradually and uni formly heating a blank of steel incorporating sulphide shape modifying elements in a furnace to a temperature whereat it can be formed, forming said blank into the desired shape, and quenching the formed article. this specification now refers to the steelmaking practice and the subsequent processing of this steel, particularly referring to the controlled shaping and hardening technique to ensure a consistently high standard of mouldboard. this subsequent processing is designed to make the best use of this high grade of steel in the hot rolled
