<ABSTRACT>
the insulation for a pipe bend against cold, sound and heat consists of two half-shells (1a, 1b) forming an insulating body (1) and a protective jacket (2) which is configured as a foil (2), separated at the inner sector and resting on the outer side of the assembled half-shells (1a, 1b).  the protective jacket (2) is produced by means of a device in which the foil (11) is deep-drawn using a lost model (13).  in this arrangement, the model is formed from a mould (13) consisting of two insulating bodies (1) which are connected to one another at the end faces.  <image>   <image>
