<ABSTRACT>
process for the preparation of / d-α-amino-p- hydroxyphenylacetamido/  groups containing penicillanic acid and  cephalosporanic acid derivatives, comprising the acylation of  a compounds of the formulae:    wherein r₁, r₂ and r₃ represent the same or a different group  and may be selected from a lower alkyl, benzyl, cycloalkyl or  phenyl-group and preferably lower alkyl and more preferably  a methyl group and wherein x represents a residue selected  from the group consisting of hydrogen, acetoxy or a  fivemembered heterocyclic thio residue, containing  heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulphur  and optionally substituted by lower alkyl and wherein an  eventually present -nh- radical has optionally been silylated,  which compound is previously prepared by the reaction of  6-aminopenicillanic acid or 7-aminocephalosporanic acid or  its 3-methyl modifications with at least one equivalent and  preferably about 2 with respect to 6-apa, 7-aca or 7-adca  and about 3 equivalents with respect to other 3-methyl modifications  of 7-aca of a tri(lower)alkyl silyl groups supplying  agent in a dry inert, water insoluble solvent, such as  methylene chloride, by rapid mixing of a pre-cooled solution  of the compound of formula i-iv with a pre-cooled reaction  mixture of at least an equimolar amount of a compound of the  formula    wherein r₄ represents lower alkyl and preferably methyl, r₅  represents hydrogen or lower alkyl and preferably methyl, r₆  represents lower alkoxy and preferably methoxy and r₇ represents  lower alkoxy and preferably methoxy, previously prepared  from the corresponding dane salt and an acid chloride  under anhydrous conditions in the presence of a tertiary  amine as catalyst, such as n-methylmorpholine in a dry, inert,  water insoluble, organic solvent such as methylene chloride  mixed with a cosolvent or methyl isobutylketone or tetrahydrofuran  optionally mixed with a cosolvent, and the continuation  of the reaction at a temperature of -10°c or lower and  preferably from 20°c to 30°c whereafter the desired compound  is recovered by usual methods.
