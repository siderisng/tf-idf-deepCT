<ABSTRACT>
the gob (10) is directed along a curved channel (12)  having a force measuring device (14) over which the gob (10)  passes for measuring the force exerted by the gob (10)  normal to its path.  the velocity of the gob (10) is determined  both before and after the normal force is measured by means  of two sets of two position sensors (p1, p2 and p3, p4), one  set located on each side of the force measuring device (14),  and a timer which determines the time period for the gob  (10) to move between the position sensors (p1, p2 and p3,  p4) of each set.  the timer also determines the time between  velocity measurements.  the date is used to calculate a value  of acceleration which is substantially proportional to the  acceleration normal to the path.  the acceleration value and  the output of the force measuring device (14) are then  interrelated in order to calculate the mass of the gob (10).
