<ABSTRACT>
in a ceiling coffer which is composed of grid-like coffer rails (10, 20) arranged perpendicularly to one another and constructed as u-profile sections (11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23), the coffer rails (10, 20) are provided, at their crossing points, with slots (16, 26) which extend only over half the height of the coffer rails, but proceed on the one hand from the open side and on the other hand from the closed side of the coffer rails.  simple formation of the slots (16, 26) during the manufacturing process of the coffer rails and a clear catch connection at the crossing points of the assembled coffer rails (10, 20) is achieved by the fact that the lateral edges (21, 23) of the slots (26) of one coffer rail (20) are provided approximately in the centre with barbs (27, 28), and that these barbs (27, 28) engage in slotted perforations (18, 19) of the coffer rails (10) arranged perpendicularly thereto, which are formed in the extension of the lateral edges of the slots (16) approximately in the centre of the remaining regions of the lateral sides of these coffer rails (10).  <image>
