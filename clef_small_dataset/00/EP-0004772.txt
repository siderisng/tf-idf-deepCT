<ABSTRACT>
4-halo-etianic acids and derivations of the formula: <chem>  wherein  x<1> is fluoro or chloro;  x<2> is fluoro, chloro or hydrogen;  x<3> is fluoro, chloro, bromo or hydrogen;  x<4> is =c=o or <chem>  of may be   <chem>  when x<3> is chloro; r is hydrogen, alkyl of one to six carbon atoms optionally substituted with one halo, or phenyl or benzyl optionally substituted on the phenyl ring with a substituent selected from alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to four atoms and halo;  r<1> is hydrogen or alkanoyl of 2 to 6 carbon atoms;  r<2> is hydrogen,  alpha -methyl or  beta -methyl; and the solid and broken lines between c-1 and c-2 represent a double or a single bond.  the compounds wherein r is other than hydrogen are useful as anti-inflammatory agents.  they can be prepared by esterifying the corresponding acid.  the 17 alpha -esters can be prepared by esterifying the corresponding 17 alpha -hydroxy compounds.  the 17ss-carboxylic group can be introduced by oxidising the corresponding 20-oxo-21-hydroxy (or alkanoyloxy) compound.  the double bond at the 4,5 position is produced by contacting the corresponding  delta <5> compound with a base.
