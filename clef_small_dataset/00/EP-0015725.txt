<ABSTRACT>
a substantially non-leafing pigment is constituted of alu­ minium flake particles having a surface layer of a residue of a  milling agent, of which a substantial proportion was a branched  chain saturated fatty acid, usually iso-stearic acid.  the alumini­ um flake pigment is produced in conventional manner either in  the presence of the milling agent alone or in the presence of a  milling agent vehicle such as mineral spirits.  the milling agent  may include a proportion of a conventional non-leafing milling  agent such as oleic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
"non-leabing aluminium flake pigmhnd and method of malting same" this invention relates to non-leafing aluminium flake pigment compositions and processes for making same. both leafing and non-leafing aluminium flake pigments are constituted of minute flakes of aluminium (including aluminium alloys). they are used in paints, - inks and other finishes to impart metallic lustre and/or silvery colour. leafing flake pigments, when dispersed in a vehicle having sufficiently high surface tension, become arranged in parallel relation at the surface of an applied coating, so as to provide a highly reflective layer that simulates the appearance of bare metal. non-leafing flake pigments (with which the present invention is concerned), on the other hand, in an applied coating layer are predominately disposed in random attitudes to the coating surface, providing a less reflective appearance than a leafing pigment. nonleafing aluminium flake pigments are desirable in thin coatings of the order of 10-15 microns which are sub aect to surface abrasion, weathering or the like. leafing and non-leafing aluminium flake pigments alike are conventionally produced by reducing aluminium particles (such as foil scrap or aluminium powder) by milling the particles in a ball mill, stamping mill or other equipment capable of flattening and breaking up the particles. the milling is performed in the presence of a minor proportion by weight of a "milling agent" such as a fatty acid. milling may be performed either dry or wet in a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral spirits. wet milling is often preferred to dry milling as a precaution against explosion in view of the pyrophoric characteristics of aluminium powder. after milling, the flake particles may in some instances be subjected to various additional treatments. presence of the milling agent in the milling operation ensures that the aluminium particles are flattened into flake form and prevents cold welding of the particles. the milling agent coats the particles and leaves a residue after milling. the milling agent residue imparts certain characteristics to the finished flake product and protects the flake particles to preserve the brightness or lustre, while reducing the hazard of fire or explosion in handling aluminium powder. it is believed that some milling agent residue may be bonded chemically to the flakes. leafing aluminium flake pigments are commonly made by using, as the milling agent, saturated straight chain fatty acids such as stearic and/or palmitic acids which are known to impart leafing properties to the flakes. leafing is believed attributable to the layer of residue of such milling agent on the produced flakes, and in particular to surface tension effects caused by that layer. these acids are highly efficient milling agents in terms of the proportion of total particulate aluminium charge that is reduced to flakes of the desired particle size in a single pass through a mill. the operations involved in making leafing aluminium flakes are simple, straightforward and convenient. in contrast, current methods of making nonleafing aluminium flake pigments are attended with serious difficulties and disadvantages. the pigments made in accordance with these methods
