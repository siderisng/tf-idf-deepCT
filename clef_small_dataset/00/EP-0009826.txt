<ABSTRACT>
a method of supplying paint at a site of application  thereof comprises the storing of the pigment component of  one or more paints in small containers (6,7) separately from  the carrier components of a paint or paints stored in a large  container (1).  a selected pigment may then be mixed with  the correct proportion of carrier just prior to application of  the paint in blender pumps (4,5) connected to the appropri­ ate containers.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a method of and apparatus for, supplying paint to a site of application thereof, such as a method of, and apparatus for supplying paint for use on road marking vehicles. more particularly the invention relates to a method of supplying paint to a site of application thereof, the paint having a pigment component and at least one other carrier component, in which components of the paint are stored separately in containers. prior proposed road marking vehicles usually have two separate storage tanks for paint, one for yellow paint and the other for white paint, since these two colours are almost universally the only colours used in road marking applications. the tanks also each have their own pumping system and sometimes each have their own heating system where the tanks are to contain paint that must be kept hot. in most operations only paint of one colour is used, thus leaving paint of the other colour in the appropriate storage tank unused. where both colour paints are used simultaneously, almost invariably one of the tanks runs empty before the other. this results in a time consuming stop for refiling of the empty tank. also, the cleaning of any tank to take paint of another colour is very time consuming. while it is desirable to increase the capacity of the tanks to obviate these problems, it has been found to be impractical to accommodate very large tanks on a road marking vehicle. in other applications where paint is used, for example in spray painting, similar problems exist. paint of a particilar colour shade may be mixed for use in a spraying operation, and if not completely used up is usually wasted. the separation of ingredients of paint of one colour for use in road marking is known. this is done with a view to improving the mechanical methods of, and apparatus for, the application of paint to a surface. in french patent specification no. 1,492,468, a system is described in which ingredients of paint are stored separately, the ingredients being such that on mixing the resultant paint commences to harden. the components are mixed to form a paint immediately prior to the application of the paint. the characteristics of the final paint layer are determined by, inter alia, the feeding of the ingredients in a particular predetermined ratio, and the speed of ingredient feed relative to the speed of a vehicle applying the paint to a road marking surface. united states patent specification no. 3,083,913, describes an apparatus for spraying paint from a mobile vehicle. the apparatus includes pumps which ensure that at the commencement of operation a first ingredient of a paint is always pumped to a spray apparatus before a second ingredient thereof. these systems do not provide a solution to the problem of wastage of excess paint as a result of its colour not being further requ^ïred. neither are they intended to solve the problem of uneven usage of different colours of paint fo example

claims:   1. a method of supplying paint to a site of application thereof, the paint having a pigment component and at least one other carrier component, in which components of the paint are stored separately in containers, characterised in that at least the pigment component of   paint    to be used is stored in a separate container (6,7) and the paint carrier component is stored in a larger container (1) being mixed together with the correct proportion of paint carrier component at or immediately adjacent the site of application just prior to paint application.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1 further characterised in that a plurality of paints are to be used, and at least the pigment component of each paint is stored in a respective separate container (6,7), and the paint carrier, comprising a mixture of paint components common to all the paints, is stored in the said larger container (1).   3. a method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 further characterised in that the containers (1,6,7) are mounted on a mobile vehicle.   4. a method as claimed in claim 3 further characterised in that the vehicle is used to apply markings to surfaces which are to be traversed by vehicles.   5. a method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the container or containers (6,7) storing pigment are located at or immediately adjacent said site.   6. a method according to any one of the preceding  claims characterised in that said pigment has other paint components mixed therewith.   7. a method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims further characterised in that the paint includes a pigment, a carrier and a binder.   8. a method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 further characterised in that the paint includes solvents.   9. a method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 further characterised in that the paint is a pigment and two component resin paint system.   10. a method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims further characterised in that the paint is heated prior to application.   11. an apparatus for utilising the method claimed in -any one of the preceding claims characterised in that said apparatus comprises a number of containers (6,7) each having an inlet (8,8) and an outlet means (9,9), the outlet means (9,9) of each container (6,7) being operatively connected to a separate respective paint component metering pump (4,5) and a container (1) large relative to the aforementioned containers (6,7), having an inlet (2) and outlet means (3), the outlet means (3) being operatively connected to each paint component metering pump (4,5).   12. an apparatus as claimed in claim 11 in which the outlet (10,10) of at least one pump (4,5) has a homogenising unit (11,11) operatively connected thereto for the blending of a paint being pumped from an outlet in use.   13. an apparatus as claimed in claim 11 or 12 charac  terised in that a heating unit is provided to heat the paint prior to application.   14. an apparatus as claimed in claim   11,12 or    13 characterised in that spray painting apparatus is connected to apply paint in use.   15. a road marking vehicle characterised in that it is fitted with apparatus according to claim 11,12,13, 14 or 15.
