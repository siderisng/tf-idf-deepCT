<ABSTRACT>
a light transmissive glass substrate (2) having a profile (3)  which matches in part a desired aspherical profile (4) and  having thereon a thin coating of a light transmissive  polymeric material which has a minimum thickness (5,5′ and  5″, 5‴) at the matching aspherical part of the glass profile and  which increases uniformly in thickness to a maximum, to give  a differential thickness which is just sufficient to accommo­ date the difference between the remainder of the profile of the  substrate and the desired profile whereby the glass substrate  (2) is first prepared to a second order of profile accuracy when  compared with the desired profile by quantity production  techniques, such as, casting, machining or grinding, the subs­ trate is then supported in a mould tool in close proximity to an  optically polished surface of a negative profile of the desired  aspherical profile and the region between the facing surfaces  of the glass substrate and mould filled with the light transmis­ sive polymeric material.
