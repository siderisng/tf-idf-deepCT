<ABSTRACT>
1.  a straightening machine for metal sheets and strips, comprising an upper and a lower series of straightening rollers supported in each case on a roller frame (4, 18) and a plurality of back-up rollers (10, 30) arranged side by side along the length of the straightening rollers (5, 22) and in which, in the case of one series of straightening rollers, back-up rollers (10) associated with a plurality of straightening rollers (5) and following in succession in each case in the direction of travel of the metal sheets are mounted on bearing supports (16), which extend transversely to the straightening rollers (5), are directed at right angles to the plane of the metal sheets and which are supported by displaceable wedges (12), characterized in that the upper and lower straightening rollers (5, 22) are movably mounted on the upper or lower roller frame (4, 18) rigidly connected to a stand cross-member (2 or 3 respectively) and are adjustable relative to one another against the force of spring elements (9 or 23 respectively) associated with their bearings (6 or 21 respectively), and, in the case of the other series of straightening rollers, the back-up rollers (30) associated in each case with individual straightening rollers (22) are mounted on a respective vertically guided support cam (29) extending parallel to the respective straightening roller (22), the support cams (29) having inclined undersides which are adjustably supported in each case on a longitudinally displaceable wedge (25) orientated parallel to the straightening rollers (22).
