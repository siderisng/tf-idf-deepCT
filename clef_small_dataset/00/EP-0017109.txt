<ABSTRACT>
a direct current motor used, for example, in a machine  tool, comprising an armature (1), a plurality of main magne足 tic poles disposed around the armature having field wind足 ings (2) wound thereon, and a plurality of e-shaped inter足 poles (8) disposed at the intermediate position along the  outer circumference of said armature between the adjacent  main magnetic poles, each of the e-shaped interpoles  consisting of a center pole (81) to which an interpole winding  (10) is wound and two side poles (82, 83), and the width of  the gap between the outer circumference of the armature  and the end surface of each of the side poles increases from  the portion of the gap which is remote from the center pole  to the portion of the gap which is adjacent to the center  poles.  in the dc motor according to the present invention, the  linearity of the magnetic flux used for commutation is  ensured in a wide range of the armature current, and,  therefore, commutating characteristics of the e-shaped inter足 poles is improved.
