<ABSTRACT>
a vapor-liquid contacting tray is disclosed having an  enclosure member overlying and extending transversely  across the tray deck top surface from a portion above a tray  support ring to an adjacent perforated portion of the tray  deck wherein the perforation openings are unobstructed by  the support ring.  a vapor flow opening is located in the  enclosure member over the portion of the tray deck above  the support ring.  vapor flowing into the enclosure member  from the overlaid tray deck perforation openings is directed  through the vapor flow opening into the liquid on the tray  deck surface portion overlying the support ring, to effect  vapor-liquid contacting and prevent liquid flow stagnation  thereon.
