<ABSTRACT>
in a drill boom arrangement, a feed beam for a rock drill  is turnable by means of a hydraulic turning device (34) about  an axis (45) that is normally parallel with the axis of drilling  during drifting.  when not actuated, the turning device (34) is  at least partially relieved of torque by means of a friction  coupling (52) which is coupled in parallel with the turning  device and is normally engaged.  the coupling is automatically  released when the turning device is actuated.  a slip-coupling  (67) is coupled in parallel with the first coupling (52)  and in series with the turning device in order to avoid  overloading of the turning device which is hydraulically  self-braking.
