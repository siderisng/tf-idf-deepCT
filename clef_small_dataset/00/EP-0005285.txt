<ABSTRACT>
a process for applying a dense, hard and wear-resistant  layer of cermets or ceramic material to a metal object  which can have a complicated shape by the spraying on of  a matrix material and hard particles of cermets or ceramic  material, followed by consolidation of the sprayed-on layer  by hot isostatic compaction of the combination at high  temperature and pressure during at least ¹/₂ hour.

<DESCRIPTION>
process for applying a dense layer of hard alloys or cermets to a metal object the invention relates to a process for applying a dense, hard and wearresistant layer of cermets or ceramic material to a metal object by the spraying on of a matrix material and hard particles of cermets or ceramic material, followed by consolidation of the sprayed-on layer at high temperature and pressure. british patent 1,451,113 discloses a process for spraying a layer on a metal object, such layer consisting of a metal or an alloy, which may contain ceramic materials, or so-called cermets. in spraying by known methods, for example flame spraying or plasma spraying of powdered materials, a porous layer is obtained. in many cases, the adhesion of this layer to the base material is found unsatisfactory, and therefore the said patent proposes consolidating the porous layer by fusing the binder metal present therein under vacuum, thus reducing the porosity. to combat oxidation, this fusion is carried out under vacuum. according to the patent, good result. are od- tained by this method if the layer consists of 50 percent by weight of tungsten carbide in a matrix of a nickel-chromium alloy serving as binder metal. as the content of binder metal in the layer decreases, and the content of hard particles accordingly increases, it seems to become more and more difficult to consolidate the layer by fusing the binder metal, and at a binder metal content of 30 percent or less, it becomes practically impossible. german letters of disclosure 1,783,061 propose application of a comparable dense layer by built-up welding, using a tubular or rod welding electrode containing a binder metal and tungsten carbides. such an electrode, according to the specification, preferably contains 30-40 percent. by weight of binder metal and 70-60 percent by weight of carbide particles. during welding, this material is further mingled with some quantity of molten base material. according to the german specification, the binder metal must contain at least one of the metals co, ni, fe or cr as chief constituent. by this method also, it is not possible to apply a dense layer to a metal object such that the layer consists of more than 70 percent by weight of ceramic or cermet particles, such as hard metal carbides, for example tungsten or titanium carbide, or other hard materials. in a layer with so high a content of hard particles, a cohesive and/or adhesive bond cannot be improved by internal fusion. according to the invention, in a process of the type initially referred to, the consolidation of the sprayed-on porous layer is accomplished by iso 0 static compaction at a temperature of at least 1000 c and a pressure of at least 1000 bars, for at least one half hour. in this way it is possible to obtain an applied layer of high density and markedly improved bonding to the base material. the process according to the invention is especially suitable for applying a layer of tungsten carbide/cobalt to
