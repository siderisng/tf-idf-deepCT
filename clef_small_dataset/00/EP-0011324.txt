<ABSTRACT>
absorption drying provides a means for agglomerating  dried food and beverage solids around an aroma/flavor  core, thereby essentially encapsulating said core and pre  serving volatile flavor and aroma compounds.  the absorp­ tion drying process is especially useful for manufacturing  instant coffee.  thus, a viscous liquid extract comprising cof­ fee aromas and flavors is sprayed into a fluidized bed of  instant coffee powder.  encapsulation of the coffee extract  occurs as multiple particles of the coffee powder attach  themselves to the aroma/flavor droplets to form aggregates.   rapidly drying the aggregates preserves the aroma/flavor in  the core of the aggregates until released during use.

<DESCRIPTION>
s?luidzed bed process for making beverage, food or the like this invention encompasses a process for capturing and etaining aromas and/or flavors of the type found in foods anc beverages, and the compositions secured therefrom. the process herein is especially useful in the manufacture of beverages, particularly instant coffee. commercial instant coffees are made by aqueous extracts of roast and ground coffee, followed by one of two basic drying processes. the older andgless expensive process involfl spray-drying the water extract. unfortunately, volatile aroma and flavor components can be lost during spray-drying, and spray-dried instant coffees are generally characterized a less flavorful and aromatic than roast and ground coffees. freeze-drying of coffee extracts is a more expensive process, but does generally yield a higher quality product with better aroma retention than spray-dried coffees. the present invention involves spraying small drops of aroma/flavor concentrates into a fluidized bed of dry coffee solids. each atomized droplet is coated with dry -coffee solid to "lock in" the desirable aromas and flavors. this process is termed "absorption drying" herein. the absorption drying process of this invention provides a loer-cost alternative to freeze-drying. by operating in a concentrated system composed of an aroma-rich core surrounded by a dry shell, the retention of volatiles during absorption drying is the same or better than with freeze-drying. it is to be understood that the adsorption drying process of this invention is not limited to the manufacture of instant coffee but can be used in the manufacture of a wide variety of instal foods, beverages and the like. in particular, instant grain beverages having excellent coffee-like aromas and flavors can be made hy the present process, as can instant teas, instant fruit-flavored beverages, instant chocolate beverages, instal sups, and tulle like. background art hair, cody and mclain, u.s. patent 3,615,669, issued 1971, disclose a fluidized bed agglomeration pro- cess for manufacturing coffee. u.s. patent 3,903,295, issued 1975, discloses a process for encapsulating materials which tend to degrade within a film-forming agent. thijssen, h.a.c., "the effect of process variables on aroma retention in drying coffee extract", asic, june 2-6, 1969; and thijssen, h.a.c., "effect of process conditions in drying coffee extract and other liquid foods cn aroma retention", asic, june 1973, relate to studies of the mass transport properties of model aroma compounds during a coffee drying operation. chandrasekaren, s.k. and king, c.j. address the topic of "volatiles retention during drying of food liquids", aiche j., 18, pp. 520-526, 1972. rulkens, w.h. has considered the "retention of volatile trace components in drying aqueous carbohydrate solutions" in his ph.d. thesis, eindhoven university of technology, 1973. chandresekaren, s.k. and ring, c.j. discuss diffusion of volatiles in their article "multicomponent diffusion and vapor-liquid equilibria of dilute organic components in aqueous sugar solutions", aiche j., 18, pp 513-520, 1972. additional work in the area of the retention of volatiles is reported by rulkens, w.h. and thijssen, h.a.c., "the retention of organic volatiles in spray- drying aqueous carbohydrate solutions", j. of food tech. 7, pp. 95-105,
