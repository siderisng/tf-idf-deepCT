<ABSTRACT>
a filter (1) for filtering out of fatty or oily particles of a gas stream, in particular from the exhaust air of large kitchens, has a plurality of one another in the presence of parallel rods (3) which transversely to the outflow direction over the entire cross-sectional width of the filter (1) or the exhaust duct are arranged. Through the rods (3), the gas stream is vortexed with the polluting contaminants, with the oily particles adhering to the Stabo surface and falling on the bars after appropriate agglomerism, where they are collected. Due to special design of the bars (3), the deposition effect can be optimized. The filter (1) has a self-cleaning effect due to the permanent drainage of the liquid fat or oil and can be used either alone or with a conventional fine filter (30 31) by the pre-separation in the filter (1) by order of magnitude and thereby Also extremely work arm work.
