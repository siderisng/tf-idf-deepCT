<DESCRIPTION>
description "polymeric composition having enhanced resistance to photodegradation" the present invention concerns a polymeric conposition waving enhanced resistance to photodegradation. polymers have in the past and continue to provide an attractive substitute for other nore traditional types of structural materials (e.g., wood and metals) because of relatively inexpensive materials and fabrication costs. as polymers continue to find new applications in, for example, the fabrication of automotive parts and building materials, they must also become more durable and capable of withsvanding prolonged exposure to a variety of degradative forces. degradation of polymers can be caused by exposure to light, heat and/or air. such degradation is usually manifest by either a partial or total loss of structura integrity, changes in light transmission properties, changes in color, loss or reduction in flexibility and/or resiliency, or any combination of the above phenomenon. those attempting to avoid polymer degradation have generally selected from among three possible approaches: (a) elimination or reduction of the degradative forces; (b) isolation of the sensitive polymer material from the degradative forces; or (c) modification of the polymer composition to enhance its resistance to degradative forces. the latter approach is generally preferable since it does not require engineering or structural change in the polymer product environment. there are a variety of additives which have been disclosed as suitable for enhancing the resistance of polymers to one or more of the degradative forces discussed hereinabove. these additives (hereinafter referred to as "stabilizers") can be physically combined wit or engrafted upon the envirommentally sensitive polymer, thereby prolong- ing its useful life in the hostile degradative envirormtent. stabilizers are available which can nance the polymers resistance to more than one of the degradative forces and conversely, a stabilizer which is effective for prevention of, for example, oxidative degradation may have little if any effect upon the polymers resistance to other degradative agents. thus, it is not uncommon for polymers to contain a variety of stabilizer materials, each being present for the prevention cf the particular degradative reaction. one of the more difficult to control of the degradative forces is irradiation of the polymer by ultraviolet light. the impact of such irradiation will of course vary depending upon the intensity and duration of exposure and thus may manifest itself only after a prolonged interval. the irradiation of polymers with ultraviolet light can often times cause cross-linking of these materials thereby reducing their resiliency and/or impact resistance. changes in color and opacity are also often affected by prolonged exposure of the polymer to ultraviolet light. while many materials are known, and commercially available, as stabilizers against ultraviolet light degradation, the degree of protection afforded by such agents is often concentration dependent. the following list of references are illustrative of the types of ultraviolet absorbers commonly used in conjunction with polymeric materials sensitive to photodegradation: u.s. patent nos. 3,362,929; 3.362,930; 3,829,292; 3,901,849; 3,910,918; 3,939,164; ukpatent999s806; and an article appearing in j. am. chem. soc., vol. 60: 1458 et seq.(1938). in addition, commonly assigned u.s. patent applications serial
