<ABSTRACT>
a heat exchanger has a plastics header tank shell (12)  and a metal tube plate (14) which receives a plurality of tubes  (13).  the tank shell (12) is attached to the tube plate (14) by  way of a plastics bead (17), which is moulded around the  edge of the tube plate (14) prior to attachment of the shell  (12) by means of ultrasonic welding.  different methods of  attachment of the shell (12) to the bead (17) are possible, for  example by an adhesive, and the edge of the tube plate (14)  may be treated in a number of ways to increase the bond  between the bead (17) and the tube plate (14), for example by  means of an inwardly directed flange (16) around the tube  plate edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements relating to heat exci iangs this invention relates to heat excilangers, and more particularly to heat cxchangers including a header tank defined by a header tank shell and an end plate of the radiator matrix. the end plates are commonly termed tube plates as they generally receive the ends of fluid carrying tubes included in the matrix. such heat exchangers have commonly been used as motor vehicle radiators, but also find application in other fields, and can be used for example as evaporators and condensers. header tar shells have in the past been attached to the tube plates by a number of methods. metal shells have commonly been soldered to the tube plate, while the rore recently introduce plastics shells have been retained by mechanical clenching of the tube plate edge over a flange on the shell, a gasket interposed between the shell and the tube plate ensuring a seal between the two. in the prior arrangements there have frequently been problems ensuring economic heat exchanger manufacture and at the same time strong mechanical joints with adequate sealing. the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a heat exchanger, which includes moulding a bead of plastics material on a tube plate, and attaching a header tank shell to the plastics bead. the invention is particularly useful for attaching plastics header tank shells, but could be used in relation to metal shells. viewed from another aspect, the invention provides a heat exchanger having a header tank attached to a tube plate, in which a bead of plastics material is moulded onto the tube plate, and the header tank is affixed to the plastics bead. embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: figure 1 is a cross-sectional plan view through a heat exchanger header tank shell in accordance with the invention; figure 2 shows part of the header tank shell and tube plate of the heat exchanger of figure 1 in a cross-section taken on the line i-i; figure 3 is a similar view to figwre 2 showing nalternative arrangenent in accordance with the invention; and figure 4 is a similar view to figures 2 and 3 but showing a further alternative arrangement in accordance with the invention. figure 1 is a plan view of a multi-pass motor vehicle radiator 11 sectioned horizontally through its plastics header tank shell 12 to reveal a plurality of tubes 13, only some of which are shown, projecting through a tube plate 14. header tank shell 12 has an internal web 15 which extends the full height and width of the interior of the header tank to divide the tank into two compartments. this strengthens the tank and tube plate assembly and also enables the multi-pass function of the radiator. in use, coolant from the motor vehiclc's engine enters one of the two compartments, passes through the tubes communicating with that compartment until it reaches the header tank at the bottom
