<ABSTRACT>
a spinal restraint device in the form of a body member  (10) having a head support portion (12), a neck support por­ tion (14), and a back support portion (16).  the back support  portion (16) has a body wraparound arm portion (30) extend­ ing laterally from each of its sides.  the body member (10) has  a front sheet-like layer of flexible material, a middle sheet-like  layer of flexible material, and a rear sheet-like layer of flexible  material.  laterally spaced longitudinal rows of stitching sec­ ure the front, middle, and rear sheet-like layers together to  form a plurality of longitudinal sleeves.  the longitudinal  sleeves extend substantially across the entire width of the  body member.  stiffener members are located within the lon­ gitudinal sleeves.  the spinal restraint device has a pair of leg  loop straps (42) attached to the rear surface of the back sup­ port portion (16) and a hoisting loop (50) attached to the rear  surface of the head support portion (12).  the pair of leg loop  straps (42) and the hoisting loop (50) are formed from one  continuous length of strap material.
