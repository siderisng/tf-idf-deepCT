<ABSTRACT>
a device for distributing fuel to a combustion engine  provided with two or more fuel pumps (32) with electromag­ netically driven displacer bodies (plungers) (22), the stroke of  each of which is limited by an adjustable stop (26, 33) which  bears on a stop support.  in order to prevent variation of the  pump deliveries due to the frequent heavy impacts, which are  exerted upon the stop support by the armature (18) of elec­ tromagnets (2) through the adjustable stop (26,33), the stop  support as well as bridge pieces (401) receiving pump sleeves  (59) form part of a firm monolith.
