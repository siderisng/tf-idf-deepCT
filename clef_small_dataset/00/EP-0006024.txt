<ABSTRACT>
milking method and apparatus in which a diaphragm  (60) interposed between a chamber (12) through which  pulsation vacuum is applied to the outer cavity (85) of a set of  teat cups through a valve (11) and a further chamber (9)  which is connected to the inner milking cavity of the teat  cups so that the vacuum in the outer chamber (85) is  controlled by the valve (11) so as not to exceed and  preferably to be equal to the vacuum in the milking cavity of  the teat cup.  the apparatus is provided in the milking  machine claw and may be associated with one or two  pulsators in that claw.  further valves (8) prevent back flow  from the claw to the teat cups.
