<ABSTRACT>
a shift control for change speed gear transmission for  vehicles having a main transmission and a two-section  group transmission provides two sets of shift paths for a  gear change lever one for each section of the group  transmission, and individual positions in each shift path set  for selecting individual ratios in the main transmission.  the  control comprises parallel axially slidable shift rods (11, 12  and 13) and a cross shaft (14) which is axially and rotationally  movable.  the shift rods present exially spaced pairs of faces  (16a, 16b, 17a, 17b and 18a) for selective engagement by a  selector finger (15) carried by the cross shaft.  one pair of  faces (16b and 17a) on each shift rod (11 and 12) is disposed  between the two pairs of faces (16a, 16b and 17a, 17b) on the  other shift rod (12 and 11).  a switch (not shown) is operable  by the cross shaft to shift the group transmission as a result  of movement of the gear change lever from one set of shift  paths to the other and a resilient detent (62) is provided in the  path of a formation (52) on the cross shaft to inform the  driver when a group transmission change is effected.   furthermore, spring abutments (55, 56) position the formation  (52) against the detent (62) in the neutral position of the  gear change lever.  in this fashion, a "double-h" pattern of  shift control is achieved using a single level having predictable  neutral positions each side of a range change "gate"  and a unique position to select each vehicle drive ratio in  high and low range.
