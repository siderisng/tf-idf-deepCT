<ABSTRACT>
the drill bit (4) for percussion and/or rotary drilling has pivotable jaws (6, 7) which are articulated on a basic body (5) and have working surfaces (9, 10).  the pivotable jaws (6, 7) are mounted in such a way that the centre of gravity of the end faces (11, 12) of the jaws (6, 7) in the swung-in initial position, as viewed in the axial direction of the drill bit (4), lies between the articulation point of the respective jaw (6, 7) and the outer margin of the same, so that the jaws (6, 7) are pivoted by the counterpressure in the ground or rock into their working position, in which they project beyond the periphery of the basic body (5) or the envelope of the swung-in initial position of the jaws (6, 7).
