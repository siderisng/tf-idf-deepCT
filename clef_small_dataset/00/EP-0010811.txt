<ABSTRACT>
in over-voltage protection means for use in a transistor  inverter (20), in which at least two normally alternatively  operable transistors (31, 32) are connected across  an input voltage line (24) subject to over-voltage  surges and transients, over-voltage sensing means (52)  is arranged to detect or anticipate over-voltage ex­ cursions, temporarily inhibit normal switching of the tran­ sistors (31, 32) for the duration of the excursion, and switch  the transistors to a non-conducting state.  the inverter (20)  is thus able to assume an effective voltage rating of twice  its normal rating.
