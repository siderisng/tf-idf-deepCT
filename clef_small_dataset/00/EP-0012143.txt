<ABSTRACT>
an expansion chamber (1) for an air filter assembly  or an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine  comprises an air inlet (7) to the chamber, and an air outlet  (10) in one wall (2) of the chamber, the outlet (10) being  positioned asymmetrically with respect to surrounding  walls of the chamber and including a cow (9) defining an  outlet orifice (10) which is inclined to the plane of the said  one wall (2), thus reducing noise emitted by the chamber  when used in combination with the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
specification title air expansion chamber the present invention relates to air expansion chambers for air filter assemblies or exhaust systems of internal combustion engines0 air filter assemblies for internal combustion engines comprise one or more expansion chambers through which air passes before entering the combustion chambers of the engine, an air filter being mounted in the, or one of the, chambers. for example, in one conventional single-chamber air filter assembly, the expansion chamber comprises a supporting surface on which a removable annular air filter may be positioned, an annular wall surrounding the supporting surface and a closure. the air filter is usually held centrally within the chamber between the supporting surface and the closure, and air is drawn through the filter from an air inlet in the annular wall to an air outlet positioned centrally in the supporting surface. the shape and relative positions of the inlet and outlet to the exapnsion chamber must be so positioned that the air filter assembly does not interfere with the surrounding components of the engine on which it is mounted, for this reason, we have found it desirable to mount the outlet to the expansion chamber asymmetrically with respect to the surrounding walls of the chamber0 where the outlet is in the form of a simple aperture in one wall of the chamber however, the chamber generates undesirably high noise levesl within certain operating frequencies of the engine. similarly, asymmetrical outlet orifices in expansion chambers of exhaust systems can generate high noise levels. in accordance with the present invention, we have found that the noise levels can be substantially reduced by froming the outlet orifice in a cowl within the chamber so that the outlet orifice is inclined to the plane of the wall in which it is mounted. the present invention therefore specifically provides an expansion chamber for an air filter assembly or an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine comprising an air inlet to the chamber, and an air outlet in one wall of the chamber, the air outlet being positioned asymmetrically with respect to surrounding walls of the chamber and including a cowl defining an outlet orifice which is inclined to the plane of the said one wall. in one embodiment of the invention, the expansion chamber is constructed to accommodate an air filter element which is positioned on the said one wall around the outlet, and a wall opposite the said one wall comprises a removable closure allowing access to the extension chamber for installation and removal of the filter element. with such a chamber, the outlet orifice is preferably so inclined that its plane intersects the wall opposite the said one wall. in general the outlet orifice ay be inclined to the supporting surface at any angle up to 90 . preferably the angle of inclination is from 10 to 600, desirably from 150to 300. usually the outlet orifice will be oriented to face across the largest dimension of the said one wall. in order to improve
