<ABSTRACT>
Reading device of a shooting target and assembly constituted by the target and such a reading device. The target I presents itself as a matrix of detectors placed at the crossing points of rectangular lines and columns. The reading device II comprises an input per line and for each line: 1) a channel A connected to this input in which are transferred in series and at the same time for all the columns the signals of the points of the line in time T₁ line reading; 2) an accumulation channel B in which the signal A signals are transferred in parallel and stored; 3) An evacuation channel C in which the signal B signals are transferred in parallel and from which they are transferred in series to the single output RL read register, to the amplifier 30 and the reading device. Storage in B allows signal processing, including integration throughout T₁ and the exhaust time of the registry. Together I, II realized in particular. Application on television in infra red.
