<ABSTRACT>
a spring brake actuator consists of an air pressure-­ responsive piston (8) and a heavy captive spring (11) which on  release of air pressure applies force to a piston (8) for applying  force to a brake and wherein the piston (8,13) is locked to the  piston rod (20) by a locking mechanism (16,17) which is  releasable by the application of a rotary motion to an exter­ nally accessible member (24) to enable release of the brake  force without applying air pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relate to sprii'ig loi^e appling actuators and relates especially but not exclusively to spring brake actuators. spring brake actu3tors have been proposed which include a fluid pressure-responsive member in a housing which, on one side of the pressure-responsive member, houses a heavy spring and, on the other side, provides a pressure chamber which, xhen pressurised, causes the }-,essure¯responsive member to oppose the force of the spring as applied to a forcetransmitting actuator rod it has also been proposed to provide for disengagement of the pressure-responsive member in relation to the actuator rod to unload the force of the spring from the actuator rod when in an unpressurised condition. repressurisation may nevertheless automatically enable re-engagement in one particular proposal, a locking mechanism has been proposed selectively operable to. couple together the pressureresponsive member and the actuator rod such that when the pressure-responsive member and the actuator rod are coupled, movement of the pressure-responsive member due to its spring loading is transmitted to the actuator rod to effect spring actuation of an operating mechanism and such that spring actuation of the operating mechanism can be disengaged by operation of the locking mechanism to uncouple the pressureresponsive member alldd the actuator rod, the locking mechallisn comprising a guide member disposed inside the actuator rod which is arranged to be hollow and locking elements being provided in continuous contact ith the guide member, the guide rember being operable to move the @ elements into engagement with the pressure-respensive member to couple t pressure-responsive member and the actuator rod together the present invention provides a housing (4, 204, 304) and a pressure-responsive member (8, 208, 308) between which and the housing a heavy spring (11, 211, 311) is retained, the pressure-responsive member forming a wall of a fluid pressure chamber -and being movable by a control pressure applied at a control port (10, 210, 310) to counteract the force of the spring, a force actuator output member (20, 220, 320) coupled to the piston via a locking mechanism and extending outwardly of the housin, characterised in that the actuator output member is a tubular member (20, 220, 320) and the locking mechanism includes a guide member (17, 217, 317) disposed inside the actuator member and axially displaceable to move one or more locking elements (16, 216, 316) into locking position between the pressure-responsive member and the actuator output member, the guide member being displaceable axially in the actuator rod by rotary motion of a manually operable release member (24, 224, 324). advantages of the invention include the fact that it affords the ponsibility of cheaper and more reliable manufacture than is the case for some prior actuators and at the same time the actuators can be made to be safer by arranging that the components thereof are constrained against flying apart in the event of failure of a vital part. in order that te invention may be more clearly understood and readily carried into effect, the same will be further described by way
