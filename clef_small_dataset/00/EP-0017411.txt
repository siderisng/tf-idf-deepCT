<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to therapeutic agents which are novel derivatives of phthalazine, and is particularly concerned with such derivatives having a substituted piperidino group in the 1position. the compounds of the invention are phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cardiac stimulants of which a preferred class selectively increase the force of myocardial contraction without producing significant increases in heart rate. the compounds are useful in the curative or prophylactic treatment of cardiac conditions, in particular heart failure. according to the invention there are provided novel phthalazine compounds of the formula: emi1.1 wherein is is a c-c¯alkyl group; and y is a group of thr formula: -(ch2)m-z wherein m is 1 or 2; and z is a group selected from: -oconr r4, -n(rê)cor , -n(rê)so2r , -n(rê)conr r4, -n(rê)so2nr r4, and -n(rê)coor , wherein rê and r4 are each independently hydrogen or c1-c4 alkyl, and r3 is c3-c7 cycloalkyl; and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. where appropriate, the alkyl groups may be straight or branched chain. the pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addltion¯salts of the compounds of the invention are those formed from acids which form non-toxic acid addition salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate or bisulphate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, saccharate and p-toluenesulphonate salts. the cardiac stimulant activity of the compounds of the invention is shown by their effectiveness in one or more of the following tests: (a) increasing the force of contraction in the isolated, spontaneously beating, guinea pig double atria or kitten right and left atria preparations; {b} increasing myocardial contractility (left ventricular dp/dt max.) in the anaesthetised cat or dog with a left ventricular catheter; (c) increasing myocardial contractility in the conscious dog with an implanted left ventricular transducer. in test (a) the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses of the atria to the test compound are measured at sevdoses and compared with the responses elicited by iso- prenaline. the comparison of the dose response curves obtained gives a measure of the force versus rate selectivity of the test compound. in test (b) the positive inotropic action of the test compound following intravenous administration is measured in the anaes thetisad cat or¯dog.the magnitude and duration of this action, and the selectivity for increase in force versus frequency of contraction of the test compound are obtained, as are its peripheral effects, e.g. the effect on the blood pressure. in test (c) the positive inotropic action of the test compound following intravenous or oral administration to a conscious dog with an implanted left ventricular transducer is measured. the magnitude of the inotropic action, the selectivity for increase in force versus frequency of contraction, and the duration of action of the inotropic effect of the test compound are all obtained. the preferred compounds of the invention have the formula emi4.1 wherein y is as defined for formula (i). preferably rê and r4 are each independently hydrogen or methyl. preferably r is a c3-c6 cycloalkyl group. z is preferably selected from the
