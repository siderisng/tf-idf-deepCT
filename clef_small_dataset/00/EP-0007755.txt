<ABSTRACT>
an improved method of producing magnetic thin film  with high coercivity and high squareness b-h hysteresis loop  for a high density magnetic recording medium is provided by  vacuum deposition of co base binary or ternary alloy systems  with re, ru or os as its alloying elements.  a co-deposition of  cobalt (co) and rhenium (re), ruthenium (ru) or osmium (os)  in a range of alloy composition by a sputtering method on a  glass or metallic alloy disk substrate under a range of deposi­ tion rate, substrate temperature and sputtering inert gas pres­ sure produces a magnetic thin film medium with a coercive  force up to 800 oe and a squareness ratio of its b-h loop up to  98%.  these films can also be produced by de-composition of  the alloy elements through other vacuum deposition methods  such as electron beam, ion beam and thermal deposition of  the alloy at a given range of substrate temperatures and  deposition rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
method and alloying elements for producing high coercive force and high squareness magnetic film for magnetic recording medium this invention relates to a magnetic recording medium comprising a thin film of a magnetic material on a non-magnetic support, and to a method of producing such a medium. in magnetic recording, the conventional recording media generally comprise y -fe203,co-doped y -fe203,fe3,04 or cro2 powdery ferromagnetic alloys dispersed into an organic binder to form a coating-layer on a suitable substrate. in this type of recording medium, because of the relatively low magnetization of the powdery ferromagnetic alloys and the existance of a non-magnetic organic binder, the recordirig medium layer should have a thickness on the order of a micrometer. in the technology of magnetic recording, the improvements which are sought are primarily concerned with the increase in the recording bit density per given area. for open-flux memory elements employed in disk, drum or tape recording systems, the limit of the recording density will be determined by the ratio of the demagnetizing field to the coercive field of the film. also the strength of the demagnetizing field is related to the saturation magnetization and the thickness of the medium. furthermore, in order to attain an acceptabe standard of maximum resolution and signal to noise ratio in the data extraction, it is necessary to obtain the smallest possible thickness of recording medium layer which is capable of providing a sufficient output signal. this compromise can be achieved with greater ease as the saturation induction and the squareness of the hysteresis b-h loop of the medium are made higher. in terms of all these constraints, it is the main objective to obtain a magnetic thin film medium having a high coercive field, a high squareness of hysteresis loop and of small layer thickness, preferably less than loooa thick, but possessing a high remanent magnetic moment. the ferromagnetic metal thin films produced by electrochemical depositions, such as electroplating and electroless plating, and by vacuum deposition, such as ion plating, diode sputtering, ion beam sputtering, electro beam evaporation and thermal evaporation, have attracted special interest as to nonbinder type magnetic recording media, ie, media that do not use a binder. this type of non-binder metallic magnetic thin film, in general, has a much higher saturation magnetic induction than the oxide media previously referred to, and therefore is fabricated ten times thinner in layer thickness as compared to binder type recording media and still provides a sufficient remanence for the output signal. although there is much progress in making magnetic disks of the metallic type thin film based on electroplating or electroless plating of ferromagnetic films such as co-p and ni-co-p, the film properties such as coercivity, hc, or squareness of the hysteresis loop, are strongly dependent on the structure of the disk substrate and the surface condition of the disk substrate. therefore, it is rather difficult to obtain a magnetic disk with uniform and desired properties without elaborate preparation and careful handling of the substrate. to overcome
