<ABSTRACT>
a forms decollator for separating superimposed continuous  forms into separate plies has a pair of abrasive rolls  (17,18) rotatable in opposite directions away from one  another and a separator roll (32) bearing thereagainst and  wholly supported thereby so that, together with the abrasive  rolls (17,18), the forms may be separate as they are moved  between the abrasive rolls (17,18) and through the nips of the  separator roll (32) and each abrasive roll so as to be directed  over guide elements (24,25) and refolded over pack breakers  which permit the separated plies to be neatly refolded.  the  guide elements (24,25) have undercut portions near their terminal  ends to avoid interference with the separated plies  during the process of refolding.
