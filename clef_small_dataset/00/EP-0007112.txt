flowable toxfflcant composition and its use as herbicide or pesticide priority: july 17, 1978, u.s.a., no. 925 l94 field of the invention this invention relates to aluminum hydroxide flowable gel pesticide and herbicide compositions and to the preparation thereof and its use. background of the invention commercially available herbicide and pesticide formulations are generally in the form of wettable powders, dusts or granules. however, such formulations are not always desirable as they present problems in handling of the formulations and are particularly irritating to the grower-user. moreover, many herbicide and pesticide active ingredients are difficult to suspend and thus do not lead to easily produced formulations of the type mentioned. in addition, in the past certain active ingredients that are insoluble organic acids were formed as dialkylamine salts.in order to obtain the necessary suspension cf the product. however, such dialkylamine salts have the po rential of forming highly undesirable nitroso amine derivatives in the enviroment. it is, therefore, highly desirable to obtain herbicide anc. pesticide formulations which avoid one or more of these disadvantages of prior art formulations. moreover, it would also be advantages to provide such new and improved herbicide and pesticide formulations which, in addition to avoiding one ,r more of the prior art problems, also leads to formulations tnat may possess one or more additional advantages over the prior art formulations. summary of the invention it has now been discovered that new and improved flowable herbicide and pesticide formulations may be formed by combining the active ingredients of suitable particle size with aluminum hydroxide gels. it has been found that such aluminum hydroxide gel herbicide and pesticide formulations in audition to elimi noting one or more of the disadvantages of prior art formulations also provides formulations that may possess one or more of he following advantages. formulations of this invention when compared to prior art formulations have been shown to possess superior suspending properties, improved crop tolerance, im proved control of selected weed species, better handling characteristics than dry dusty wettable powders, an environmental safety advantage over emulsifiable concentrates containing volatile organic carriers and enhanced desiccation-defoliation action thereby reducing the amount of pesticide required as a harvest aid. details of the invention a broad range of navel herbicide and pesticide formulatlxns in flowable form are provided according to this invention by mixing the active ingredients of suitable particle size with aluminum hydroxide gels. the formulations of the invention are generally prepared by incorporating the appropriate quantity of the active ingredient along with any desired freeze thaw agent, water, and suitable wetting, dispersing and antifoam agents into any suitable mill, or homogenizer such as, for example, an attitor or ball mill, where the ingredients are intimately and homogeneously mixed and the particle size of the herbicide or pesticide is reduced to the desirable particle size range, generally from about 2 to about 5 microns average particle diameter the nix- ture, qf desired particle size, is then removed from the mill and aluminum hydroxide gel combined therewith with mixing
