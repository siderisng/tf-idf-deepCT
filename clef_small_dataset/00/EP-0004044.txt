<ABSTRACT>
granular activated carbon is manufactured from subbituminous  coal by crushing and screening the as received  coal containing about 10 to about 25% moisture by weight to  produce 8/30 mesh granules, treating the granules with a  dilute aqueous solution of inorganic acid at a concentration  from about 1 to about 25% by weight to reduce the volatile  content and thereby increase the fixed carbon content, the  particular concentration being selected to provide the  desired activity and porosity of the activated carbon, comprising:  mixing the granules with the acid, washing off the  acid, and drying the granules at least partially to a moisture  content below about 25% by weight.  the granules are mixed  with from 0 to about 15% by weight of coal tar pitch.  the so  treated granules are ground to form fine powder of not less  than about 60% by weight -325 mesh, preferably more than  about 65% by weight -325 mesh, which is compressed into  shapes, such as pellets or thin corrugated sheets under high  pressure, and then granulated to reform 6/20 mesh  granules.  these reformed granules are then directly activated,  without prior charring and devolatilization, by directly  heating to and at a temperature higher than the devolatilizing  temperature in an atmosphere containing a gaseous activating  agent.
