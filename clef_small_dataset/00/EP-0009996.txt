<ABSTRACT>
a method for preparing vindesine monosulfate dihy­ drate (one mole of vindesine per mole of sulfuric acid),  substantially free from hemisulfate and disulfate character­ ized by dissolving vindesine base in acetonitrile or acetone  at a concentration at about 1% and slowly adding with stir­ ring the equimolar amount of 1n aqueous sulfuric acid.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
preparation of vindesine sulfate vindesine is disclosed in the belgian patent no. 813,168 of cullinan, and gerzon, issued october 2, 1974, and is named therein as 4-desacetyl vlb c-3 carboxamide. the compound has the following structure emi1.1 vinesine can also be named as 4-desacetyl-3-descarbomethoxy- vlb 3-carboxamide or as 23-amino-04-desacetyl23-demethoxy-vincaleukoblastine. a sulfate salt of vindesine is also specifically disclosed in belgian patent no. 813,168 issued october 2, 1974. in transplanted tumor systems in animals, vindesine has shown an activity approaching that of vincristine although potentially lacking some of the neurological side-effects which accompany the clinical 'a use of the latter drug. vindesine is now undergoing a world-wide clinical trial and has found utility in early tests against certain leukemias, lymphomas, and some carcinomas of the lung. vinblastine and vincristine two related vinca alkaloids now being marketed as oncolytic agents, are formulated as sulfate salts for use in intravenous administration to patients suffering from various tumors. it was, however, found that vindesine sulfate prepared by simply mixing a solution of vindesine base in different solvents with 2 equivalents of dilute sulfuric acid and then evaporating to dryness was electrostatic ±difficult to handle) and its stability was unsatisfactory for storage. this invention provides a method for the preparation of vindesine sulfate which yields a product of good shelf stability which is easy to handle. this invention provides a process for the preparation of vindesine sulfate which comprises the steps of dissolving substantially pure vindesine base in acetonitrile or acetone at a concentration of about 1% and then adding thereto one mole of in aqueous sulfuric acid with stirring at a rate such as to minimize formation of vindesine disulfate to yield a product which is substantially pure vindesine monosulfate. the rate of addition and degree of mixing becomes critical as the neutralization of the vindesine base near comition. in my novel process, the preparation of the sulfate salt of vindesine is preferably carried out in two steps. first, one equivalent of 1n aqueous sulfuric acid is added slowly (dropwise with stirring) to a 1% vindesine solution in acetonitrile. after this addition has been completed, the resulting suspension is stirred for about 1/2 hour after which time, the slow addition with stirring of the remaining equivalent of 1n aqueous sulfuric acid is carried out. stirring is then continued for an additional half-hour, after which time the precipated vindesine sulfate is separated by filtration. the filter cake is washed with the same organic solvent used to dissolve the vindesine base initially, and is then dried to a constant weight. the yield of sulfate from base is 94-96 percent. more specifically, the 1n aqueous sulfuric acid is added to the 1% solution of vindesine in acetonitrile, at a rate such that the rate of addition of sulfuric acid to the vindesine solution coupled with the rate of stirring or degree of mixing serves to avoid the formation of vindesine disulfate. a rate of about 1 ml./min. has been found to be satisfactory, particularly towards the end

 claims    1. a process for the preparation of vindesine sulfate characterized by the steps of dissolving substantially pure vindesine base in acetonitrile or acetone at a concentration of about 1% and then adding thereto one mole of 1n aqueous sulfuric acid with stirring at a rate such as to minimize formation of vindesine disulfate to yield a product which is substantially pure vindesine monosulfate.    2. a process according to claim 1 in which the solvent is acetonitrile.     3. a process according to claims 1 or 2 in which the 1n aqueous sulfuric acid is added at the rate of 1 ml. per min. or slower.    4. the process according to claim 1 characterized by the steps of dissolving vindesine base in acetonitrile or acetone at a concentration of about 1% and then adding thereto one   equivalent of 1n    aqueous sulfuric acid with stirring so as to form vindesine hemisulfate and then adding a second equivalent of 1n aqueous sulfuric acid thereto with stirring to convert the vindesine hemisulfate to vindesine monosulfate at such a rate as to minimize the formation of vindesine disulfate, to yield a product which is substantially pure vindesine monosulfate as the dihydrate.    5. vindesine sulfate which is substantially pure vindesine monosulfate when prepared by a process according to any of claims 1   ,to    4.
