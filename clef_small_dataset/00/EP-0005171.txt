<ABSTRACT>
improved aqueous vinylidene chloride copolymer  latexes are provided in which the dispersed polymer particles  are heterogeneous and comprise from 35 to 75  weight percent of polymerized vinylidene chloride and  contain a major amount of a soft copolymer core comprising  vinylidene chloride and an aliphatic conjugated diene  and a minor amount of a polymeric shell which encompasses  the core portion and which consists essentially  of (a) an aliphatic conjugated diene, a monovinylidene  aromatic monomer or a saturated aliphatic ester of monoethylenically  unsaturated carboxylic acids; (b) optionally,  up to 40 weight percent (based upon the shell) of vinylidene  chloride; and (c) optionally, up to 10 weight percent  based upon such shell of a monoethylenically unsaturated  carboxylic acid.  these latexes have good heat and light  stability and are useful as paper coatings, in carpet backsizing  and in nonwoven fabrics.
