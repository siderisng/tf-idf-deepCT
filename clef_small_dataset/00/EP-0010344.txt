<ABSTRACT>
a digital signal detector is disclosed that detects a serial  bit stream transmitted at a predetermined bit frequency.  bit  transistors are totalized in a counter (115) over a predetermined  time interval.  bit transistions occuring during a good  window interval from gate (111) increment the totalized count  by one.  bit transistions occurring during a bad window interval  from gate (112) decrement the totalized count by one.  bit  transistions occurring during a marginal window interval  from gate (110), situated between the good and bad window  intervals, do not affect the totalized count.  if the counter (115)  reaches a predetermined count during the time interval, a  detect signal is provided by flip flop (117) indicating that the  digital signal has been detected.  the counter (115) can be  further loaded with a threshold count for tailoring the digital  signal detector for operation at a particular signal-to-noise  ratio.  periodic signals that have frequencies that are submultiples  of the bit frequency are detected by correlating the  digital signal between two predetermined stages of a shift  register (101).  the digital signal detector may provide a detector  output signal when both the digital signal is detected at flip  flop (117) and periodic signals having submultiple frequencies  are not present at flip flop 106).
