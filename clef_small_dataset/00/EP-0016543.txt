<ABSTRACT>
a seat cushion for a motor vehicle seat is produced by  assembling a main block of plastics foam (23) within a  u-shaped block of plastics foam (22).  the foam blocks are  located on a heat weldable flexible backing cloth (19).  a sheet  of heat weldable flexible trim cover material (24) is laid over  the top of the blocks.  a dielectric welding tool (14) having  lower (11) and upper (15) bases carrying lower (12,13) and  upper (16,17) electrodes respectively is then used to weld the  top cover (24) and backing cloth 19 together around the outer  periphery of the u-shaped block (22) and between the blocks  (22,23).  in order to ensure that the foam blocks are tightly held  within the top and bottom covers, the outer peripheries of the  covers are resiliently anchored (21, 21a) prior to the welding  operation so that as the electrodes of the welding tools come  together they draw the covers around the blocks compressing  the blocks (22,23) within the cavities formed between the  covers.

<DESCRIPTION>
methods of making seat cushions this invention relates to methods of making seat cushions and is particularly although not exclusively applicable to methods of making seat cushions for seat bases and seat backs of motor vehicle seats. it is known to = re a trim panel comprising two sheets of heat weldable material secured together by heat welding wit7, foam blocks trapped between the sheets as, for example, described in u.k. patent specification no. 1100533. this method is not however suitable for manufacturing seat cushions such as those used in motor vehicle seats because the foam is not tightly held between the two layers of sheet material. this invention provides a method of making a seat cushion comprising the steps of assembling a main resilient plastics foam block with at least one subsidiary plastics foam block to provide a perimeter part of the cushion, locating a top trim cover of heat weldable material over the intended top surface r2 the two blocks, 2locating an underside trim cover of heat weldable material over the intended utlder-parts and sides of the block, holding at least one of the covers around it perimeter and heat welding the under/side cover to the top cover around the outer perimeter of the foam block assembly and between the two foam blocks to form separate pockets between the trim covers in which the foam blocks are firmly held. preferably both the top and under/side trim covers are held around their perimeters during the heat welding operation. the subsidiary block may be generally u-shaped to receive within the u the main block. the u-shaped block may be formed in one piece or may be formed from three separate pieces. the following is a description of some specific embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings i which: figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of the apparatus utilized to carry out the method of the present invention. figure 2 is a diagrammatic sectional view in side elevation of the apparatus shown in figure 1. figure 3 is a diagrammatic cross-sectional view showing part of d vehicle seat support structure on which is mounted a seat cover formed by the method according to the invention. figure 4 a diagrammatic sectional view in side elevation of the seat support structure and seat cover shown in figure 3. this invention relates particularly but not exclusively to motor vehicle seats and to a method of making such seats. according to the invention there is provided a method of forming a seat cushion in which the lower portion 10 of a two-part dielectric welding tool comprises a fixed base 11 from which extends an upstanding outer electrode 12 which in plan view is of substantially rectangular shape with rounded corners. the rear wall of the -lectr.cde is lower in height than the front wall, whilst the heights of the side walls changes correspondingly along their lengths between the front and rear walls such that the top edges are of arcuate
