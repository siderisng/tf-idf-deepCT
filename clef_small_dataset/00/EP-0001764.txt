<ABSTRACT>
1.  clamping toolholder, comprising a shank with a recess for the support of a base plate with central boring, an indexable insert with a central hole and clamping means, said the clamping means comprising a cylindrical bushing, which is fixed in a shankbore below said recess, including a ringflange at its upper end and a clamping element, having a lower part extending into the bushing and a head part extending through the base plate into the insert hold and adjoining itself to the wall of the hole, so that the clamping element is supported within the bushing by plate springs and movable in the direction of the axis thereof, guided by spring forces, characterized in, that there is a prolongation (6) of in top view approximately semicircular shape, beginning at said ringflange (5) of the bushing (4) and extending upwardly to be in the central hole of the indexable insert (2) in its area adjacent to the cutting edge and that the prolongation in its inner surface area (11) has toroidal shape to permit the head part (10) of the clamping element (7) of the shape of a ball or a truncated cone to adjoin itself to the prolongation at two points, which include an angle of 120 degrees with the axis of the clamping element (7).
