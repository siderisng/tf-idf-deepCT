<ABSTRACT>
a diaphragm- or membrane-electrolytic cell comprising  a plurality of anodes and cathodes, a diaphragm or mem­ brane between adjacent anodes and cathodes, and slotted  diaphragm- or membrane-supports, wherein the diaphragms  or membranes (6) are sealed to the lips (12) defining the  slots in the supports by means of one or more clamps  which provide an essentially leak-tight seal between the  diaphragms or membranes and the lips on the supports.   in a preferred embodiment the clamp comprises inner (30)  and outer (31) flexible bands between which the assembly  of diaphragm or membrane and lips are located and clip­ ping device (32) in the form of a wire bent into a sinuous  path providing shaped profiles, which device is applied over  the assembled inner and outer bands such that alternate  profiles or groups of profiles lie on opposite sides of the  assembly.
