<ABSTRACT>
an automatic intravenous flow regulator for regulating  the infusion rate of a parenteral solution flowing from an  intravenous fluid container to a patient.  when the level of  parenteral solution in the container is above a threshold level,  the infusion takes place at a first flow rate.  when the level of  fluid in the container drops below the threshold level, fluid  flow continues but at a second flow rate less than the first flow  rate.  in one embodiment, the flow rate is controlled principally  from outside the iv container; while, in a second embodiment,  the flow rate is controlled from within the iv container.   other embodiments are disclosed including one in which the  initial flow rate may be adjusted; one in which the fluid is  filtered prior to delivery to the patient; and one in which the  initial flow rate is maintained at a constant value with time,  secondary flow rate remains fixed, and complete filtration of  the intravenous solution being infused is provided.
