<ABSTRACT>
a method of producing a multilayer laminated sheet  material carrying a decorative effect comprises the steps of  applying to one side of a sheet of transparent thermoplastic  material, preferably polymethyl methacrylate, to constitute  a two layer assembly having a decorated side, material providing  a decorative effect; adhesively applying to the decorated  side of the two layer assembly a coating of a composition  comprising uncured acrylic material; allowing or  causing said coating to cure to provide a protective overcoat  covering the material providing the decorative effect; adhesively  applying to the protective acrylic overcoat a coating  comprising a solution of an acrylate polymer in a difunctional  acrylic monomer and a low viscosity polyester resin;  allowing or causing the latter coating to cure to provide a  further layer; adhesively applying to said further layer a  glass fibre reinforced plastic (grp) composition comprising  styrene monomer, polyester resin and glass fibre; and allowing  or causing the latter composition to cure to provide  a glass fibre reinforced plastics layer.  the multilayer laminated sheet may be flat or may be  shaped, e. g.  as a bath or washbasin with the decorative  effect visible on the concave side.  shaping is carried out  before the application of the grp layer and preferably before  the application of the material providing the decorative  effect.
