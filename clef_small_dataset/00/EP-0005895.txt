<ABSTRACT>
a track assembly element (10) comprises a pair of  laterally spaced links (13) releasably secured to each track  shoe (12) thereof.  a drive lug (17) extends between the links  (13) and a rail (14) is disposed on each link (13).  a plurality of  bolts (18,19) provide common fasteners for releasably  securing the links (13), track shoe (12), drive lug (17) and rails  (14) together.  a pair of such bolts (18,19) are preferably  disposed on each lateral side of each link (13) to increase the  lateral stability of the links (13) and overall structural integrity  of the track assembly element.
