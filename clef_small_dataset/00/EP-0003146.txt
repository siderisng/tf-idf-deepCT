<ABSTRACT>
a device for treating waste water, wherein by gravitational segregation the waste water is separated from the water-insoluble substances contained therein, such as oil, comprises a stream trajectory, which accomodates a feeding chamber communicating with lower ends of separation channels.  therein the substance guide means extend transversely of the stream trajectory below the channels.  since the overall flow space of the plate separator is passed in one and the same upward direction and because it is ensured that the flow rate in alle separation channels is substantially the same, a satisfactory gravitational segratation is obtained owing to the comparatively low, uniform flow rate in alle separation channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
a device for treating waste water the invention relates toa device for treating waste. water, wherein by gravitational segregation the waste water is separated from the water-insoluble substances contained therein, such as oilf comp;rising a reservoir having a mixture inlet, a water outlet^ and at least one outlet for separated substances separated from the water outlet, which reservoir accommodates at least one stream trajectory including a plate separator having a plurality of parallel, sequential, flat separation channels bounded by separation plates and a feeding chamber communicating with lower ends of the separation cnannels and an outlet chamber communicating with top ends of the separation channels, whilst substance guide means joining the separation plates project transversely of the stream trajectory below the channels and increase the flow resistance in the direction of disposition of the channels the more so the nearer they are disposed to a feeding chamber. such a device is known from us patent 367,308. in the known device the stream trajectory in the plate separator has a zigzag shape. for this purpose the stream trajectory is formed by a sequence of trajectory sections directed parallel to one another and alternately extending upwards and downwards and having a successively larger overall passage towards sucessively narrower separation channels. although it is thus endeavoured to improve the separation by decreasing the flow rate in the last trajectory section, the flow rate in all trajectory sections and even in the last one is high. the invention provides a device of improved separation capacity and/or of smaller dimensions, since all separation channels communicate with their lower ends with one and the same inlet chamber, since all separation channels conduct mixture only in upward direction, since all separation channels have substantially equal passages and since the substance guide means and the angle between the separation plates on the one hand and a guide wall on the other hand are proportioned so that the quantity of flow in all separation channels is substantially the same. since the overall flow space of the plate separator is passed in one and the same upward direction and because it is ensured that the flow rate in all separation channels is substantially the same, a satisfactory gravitational segregation is obtained owing to the comparatively low, uniform flow rate in all separation channels. the aforesaid and further features of the invention will be explained more fully hereinafter with reference to examples. the drawing schematically shows in: figure 1 a longitudinal sectional view of a preferred embodiment of a device in accordance with the invention, and figure 2 a perspective view of detail ii of figure 1. the device 1 shown in figures 1 and 2 for separating water 2 and water-insoluble, light substances 3 contained therein, for example, oil comprises a reservoir 4 for receiving a mixture 5 of water 2 and substances 3 and a plurality of sequential, parallel, sloping separation channels 6 arranged in the reservoir 4 and bounded by channel walls 7, an inlet chamber 9, a
