<ABSTRACT>
an adhesive tape which includes an acrylic pressure  sensitive adhesive mass coated on one side of a saturated  paper, said paper (1) being saturated with from 20 to 75 parts  per hundred parts paper of an acrylic polymer having a tg of  less than 20°c, and (2) comprising a mixture of woodpulp  and thermoplastic fibres, said woodpulp comprising from  about 10 to 75 per cent by weight of the paper, and said  thermoplastic fibres ranging in length, on the average, from  about 1/4 to 3/4 of an inch (6. 3 to 19m/m) and being selected  from polyamide, polyester, polypropylene and polyethylene  fibres, and a backsize coated on the other side of said paper,  said backsize preferably being selected from styrene copolymers  having a tg of at least 35°c, silicones, fluorocarbons,  long chain fatty acids, long chain fatty acid derivatives and  mixtures thereof.  preferably the pressure sensitive mass is a  blend of a copolymer of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and vinyl  acetate with a copolymer of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and  tert-butyl acrylamide.  the tape is especially useful as a surgical tape and has  an improved combination of the properties of conformability,  straight tear and resistance to curling.  moreover, because  of the high amounts of woodpulp included in the paper  utilized in making the tape, an economical product is  obtained.
