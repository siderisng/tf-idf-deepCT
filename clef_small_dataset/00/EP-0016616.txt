<ABSTRACT>
a tool driver and holder for rotary cutting tools, such as  reamers and drill bits, comprises a shank member (10)  having a cylindrical portion (11) projecting axially from one  end thereof and this cylindrical portion (11) has at least two  tool securing and driving spline members (12) projecting  longitudinally from the end thereof remote from the shank  (10).  these spline members have arcuate outer faces (21) and  radially inwardly extending side faces merging into a convex  inner face to provide a central axial gap and symmetrically  disposed radial gaps therebetween.  a cylindrical sleeve  member (14) is rotatably mounted on the cylindrical portion  (11) and splines (12) and this sleeve member (14) has at the  outer ends thereof radially inwardly projecting tool holding  tab members (15).  the sleeve (14) and associated tab  members (15) are positionable between a tool securing and a  tool releasing position.  the tool holder is adapted to receive a symmetrical  reversible fluted cutting tool (19) of generally cylindrical  outer configuration having curvilinear flutes formed in the  outer face thereof symmetrically disposed about and extendÂ­ ing the length of the tool body, defining peripheral lands  between the flutes, retaining indentations (29) formed in the  lands at the mid point of the tool body, and cutting edges  formed in both end regions of the tool.
