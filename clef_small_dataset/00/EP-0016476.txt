<ABSTRACT>
disclosure is made of a method of improving the com足 bustion of base fuels selected from ammonia, petroleum dis足 tillates, alcohols and amines.  the method comprises the addi足 tion of hydrogen carriers to the base fuels, which possess an  energy content and release it together with hydrogen for  combustion upon ignition of the base fuel.  the disclosure is  also of novel fuel compositions which comprise from 0. 5 to 15  percent by weight of a hydrogen carrier dissolved or sus足 pended in the base fuel.
