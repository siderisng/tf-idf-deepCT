<ABSTRACT>
programmed controllers execute sequences of control  functions for controlling a device.  external noise can cause  controller malfunctions on critically operated devices.  proper  sequencing is verified by assigning an access key/check  code to particular sequences.  a check key code is generated  during execution of a sequence only if the sequence is proper­ ly executed by the programmed controller.  on completion of  the control sequence, the generated code is compared with  the access or original code for verifying appropriate pro­ grammed controller sequencing.  several sequences can be  embedded or nested in each other, each having its own check  key with the overall sequence also having an independent  check key.
