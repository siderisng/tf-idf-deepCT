<ABSTRACT>
a method and an apparatus are disclosed which employ  digital techniques to approximate a multiplication of an anlog  signal by a sine wave signal of an appropriate frequency.  the  analog signal is converted by an analog to digital converter  (30) to a digital representation which includes a sign bit (34)  and a plurality of magnitude bits (35 - 40).  the sign bit of the  digital representation is selectively complemented by an  inverting logic gate (44) which is controlled by a square wave  signal (42) having the appropriate frequency of the sine wave  signal which is being approximated.  the selective com足 plementation of the sign bit of the digital representation func足 tions to multiply the digital representation by +1 or -1 as  determined by the status of the square wave signal.  the  resulting digital representation is stored in a latch (48) at  periodic intervals for further processing of the digital rep足 resentation which results from the quasi digital multiplica足 tion.
