<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns a disk file controller for the  transfer of data from a parallel by bit interface to a serial by  bit disk file interface.  a data channel has a data register (9), serializing and  deserializing means (50 and 53) and a variable frequency  oscillator to transfer parallel by bit data received by the  register (9) from a dci bus out to be recorded serially  by bit on a disk file.  alternatively the data channel receives  serial by bit data read from a disk file and transfers it  through the data register (9) in parallel by bit form to a  dci bus in.  the several units of the data channel are con足 trolled by a control register (28) supplied from a micro足 processor (6).  the microprocessor receives data selec足 tively from the dci bus out and from the data register  (9).  changes in format of the disk file data can be accom足 modated by the microprocessor (6) without need to change  special purpose formatting hardware.
