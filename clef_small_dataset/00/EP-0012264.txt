<ABSTRACT>
a multi-track magnetic transducer head having a set of  transducing elements (78, 80, 82) connected in series is interconnected  with driver means for selectively energising the  transducing elements.  the driver means comprises a plurality  of parallel circuit paths (102, 100, 126, 124) connected between  a voltage source (+v) and a constant current source  (130).  each of the parallel circuit paths comprises first (84, 88,  92, 91) and second (87, 86, 90, 96) switching means connected  in series via a respective circuit node (300, 302, 304, 306).   each transducing element (e. g.  78) is connected between an  individual pair (300, 302) of the aforementioned circuit nodes.   control means comprising individual control devices (106,  108, 110, 112, 132, 134, 136, 138) enables the switching means  to be selectively operated so that current (-iw1, +iw1) can  be caused to flow in either direction through a selected transducing  element or a selected group of adjacent transducing  elements.  a switch (150) in a shunt circuit path (148) can be  operated to shunt current away from the transducing elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
data transducing apparatus this invention relates to transducing apparatus for recording digital information. it is well-known in the prior art to use a magnetic transducer to record and/or reproduce data in the form of magnetic transitions from a magnetic recording medium positioned in proximity to the transducer. the magnetic transducer is generally of the inductive type, which is fabricated from a first method in which a coil is wound around one leg of a yoke of magnetic material having a gap which interacts with the medium, or from a second method using thin film technology wherein a planar coil is deposited on a magnetic substrate and closed with a magnetic pole piece. a third method, using thin film technology uses a magnetoresistive film between magnetic substrates to reproduce a signal from the field emanating from a magnetic media. transducers of the third method require an excitation current to sense the signal. transducers derived from the first and second methods are called d¯/dt transducers. in the prior art, a transducer whether of the d¯/dt type or of the m-r type, may be a single-track head or a multi-track head. with the single-track head, at any instant of time, only one track of data is recorded on or reproduced from the media. in contrast, with the multitrack head, a multiplicity of data tracks are recorded or reproduced simultaneously by the head during a particular time interval. one characteristic of all recording transducers, be it single-track or multi-track, is that bidirectional energization current sometimes called "write current" must be supplied to the head. the direction of current flow depends on the character of the data to be recorded. for example, if the data is a logical "1", then the energization current flows in the opposite direction to the current for the immediately preceding data. likewise if the data is a logical "0", then the energization current flows in the same direction as the first direction. the data is usually recorded in one of the prior art recording formats; for example, non-return-to-zero (nrz) and return-to-zero, sometimes called pulse code recording. although the present invention is useful with either of the enumerated recording formats, it is particularly useful with the pulse code recording format. in order to effect the writing of data on the media, the recording transducer must be driven by a write driver, sometimes called a "write amplifier." a tri-state driver is necessary for driving a transducer recording data in the return-to-zero format. a bi-state driver is needed for energizing a transducer recording data in the nrz format. various methods and configurations of drivers are used in the prior art for driving transducers. in u.s. patent specification 3,336,595, a coil of a recording head is coupled across the collector terminals of a pair of transistors configured in a conventional flip-flop circuit. a trigger circuitry is provided for energizing the transistor so that current will flow through the recording coil bidirectionally. this u.s. specification also discloses a system whereby the driver circuit is used
