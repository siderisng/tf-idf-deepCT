<ABSTRACT>
this device employed for example in the paper manufacturing, is used to adjust directly the reaction process.  such devices must have a good response to the behaviour of the fibre material in the paper machine, a reduced maintenance time and a failure-free operator.  this device comprises a flow pipe (12) closed at its lower end by a wire sieve (13) and which may tilt about a horizontal axis (36) in a vertical plane.  hence, either the upper opening (14) thereof may be aliyned with a product input (8), or the lower sieve (13) may be brought under a washing device (40).  the pipe (12) is filled up to the overflow (15) with a product sample and it is cause to flow through the sieve (13).  the amount of filtrate collected in a measuring beaker (27) during a predetermined time interval (after a previous flowing period) is the value searched for.
