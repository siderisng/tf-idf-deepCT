<ABSTRACT>
a method of spraying an amorphous refractory material,  wherein, in order to prevent the refractory material from  spattering during the spraying and to prevent coatings from  splitting, a surface to be sprayed is surrounded with a  stambling member provided with air discharge holes such as  a metal net.  refractory material is injected into a cavity sur­ rounded with the stambling member, whereby the air is car­ ried outside through the discharging holes and only the  refractory material is condensed and accumulated onto the  surface to be sprayed surrounded with the stambling  member so that a rigid, thick coating adheres coherently to  the surface.
