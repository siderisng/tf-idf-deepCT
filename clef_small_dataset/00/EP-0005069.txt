<ABSTRACT>
a washing installation for washing machined parts  having internal ducts comprises a pair of axially spaced  article-holders (2) mounted on a common drive shaft (9), and  a transfer device (1) for transferring articles (7) to be washed  to the holders (2).  each holder (2) is rotatable step-wise from  an article-loading and unloading station and through a  plurality of washing stations before returning to the loading  and unloading station, and a plurality of holding locations (3)  are provided on the holder (2) to hold a plurality of articles  (7), there being provided a washing box (5) at each holding  location for applying washing medium to the article (7).  the  latching devices (8) are provided one at each of the holding  locations (3) for holding the articles (7) in position at all times  other than when the holding location is at the loading and  unloading station.  in order to improve the washing action to be applied to  each article (7) and particularly to the internal ducts thereof,  each washing box (5) is connected to a corresponding one of  the latching devices (8) for movement therewith so that,  when the latching device (8) moves to the latched position,  the article (7) is held firmly in position in the holding location  (3) and also against the washing box (5).  in order to prevent handling problems during the loading  and unloading of the articles (7), it is preferred that the  supply of washing liquid to the washing boxes should be  controlled so that no washing liquid is supplied to a washing  box (5) when the latter has been moved with the holder (2) to  the loading and unloading station.

<DESCRIPTION>
washing installation for machined parts this invention relates to a washing installation for washing articles such as machined parts having internal ducts, said installation comprising a washing machine and a transfer device for transferring articles to be washed to the washing machine, said washing machine comprising a rotary article-holder which is rotatable step-wise from an article-loading and unloading station and through a plurality of washing stations before returning to the loading and unloading station, a plurality of holding locations provided on said holder to hold a plurality of articles, a plurality of washing devices provided one at each of said holding locations for applying a washing medium to the article held at the location, and a plurality of latching devices provided one at each of said holding locations for holding a corresponding article at each location during rotation of the article-holder through said washing stations. washing machines are very well known in which the articles to be washed are transferred by a conveyor device or pushed by a system of push bars with eclipsable fingers. these machines have wheels placed on the bars and the articles pass from these bars to the wheel and are taken step-by-step by the wheels through washing stations until they have gone round completely and returned to the original positions. a variation in these known machines consists of placing washing boxes at each of the wheel stations, so that washing takes place the whole time the article moves from station to station, due to the gradual turning of the wheel. the articles are normally fixed within each of the wheel stations by means of a latch finger which is opened by the action of a spring and an eccentric. this latch finger is open in the loading and unloading station and closed in all the other stations. one of the main disadvantages of placing the articles on washing jets of the actual wheel, consists of the fact that the flow of liquid is continuous in all of the stations, including the loading and unloading stations. as a result of this , the force of the jets acts during the loading and unloading of articles, which is a very delicate moment and there is the risk that the jets may make the articles jump and not become properly held in position and/or cause damage to the washing machine or the articles. a washing installation according to the invention is able to overcome the disadvantages of the known washing machines and achieves greater efficiency in forcing the washing liquid through the inner ducts of the article to be washed (when the article is an internally ducted part such as a machined part). accordingly, the present invention provides a washing installation for ashing articles such as machined parts having internal ducts, said installation comprising a washing machine and a transfer device for transferring articles to be washed to the washing machine and said washing machine comprising: : a rotary article-holder which is rotatable stepwise from an article-loading and
