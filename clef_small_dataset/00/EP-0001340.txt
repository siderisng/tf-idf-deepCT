<ABSTRACT>
a wholly aromatic polyester is provided which unlike the  aromatic polyesters normally encountered in the prior art is  not intractable or difficultly tractable and readily under-goes  melt processing with ease.  the aromatic polyester of the  present invention consists essentially of the recurring units (a)  p-oxybenzoyl moiety, (b) 2,6-dioxynaphthalene moiety, and  (c) tetephthaloyl moiety, and is free of units which possess  ring substitution.  the resulting polyester exhibts a melting  point below approximately 325°c, preferably below 300°c,  and most preferably below approximately 290°c.  the ability  of the wholly aromatic polyester to readily undergo melt processing  can be attributed to its atypical inherent propensity to  form a thermotropic melt phase at relatively low temperatures.   the wholly aromatic polyester may be formed by a  variety of procedures including a slurry polymerization technique  (as defined) or a melt polymerization technique.
