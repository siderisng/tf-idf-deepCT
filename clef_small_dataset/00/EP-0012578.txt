<ABSTRACT>
hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates are used  as smoke-depressant additives for polymer compositions, in  particular for plasticized vinyl chloride polymer compositions.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
polymer compositions containing hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates as smoke-depressant additives this invention relates to polymer compositions having a smoke-depressant component incorporated therein. in british patent specification 1 432,860 there are disclosed plasticized halogen-containing polymer compositions in which the plasticizer comprises a phosphate ester, and which contain certain metal compounds as 11reactive modifiers". the effect of the reactive modifier is to reduce smoke and flame generation, should the polymer composition ignite, compared with similar polymer compositions containing equivalent amounts of other metal compounds5 e.g. those such as calcium carbonate conventionally used as fillers, which are not reactive modifiers. a preferred reactive modifier according to specification 1,432,860 is magnesium carbonate, and, as indicated above, calcium compounds are not considered to be reactive modifiers. we have now found that certain double carbonates of magnesium and calcium are very effective in reducing smoke emission from burning polymer compositions, and give results comparable with those obtained with magnesium carbonate while being considerably less expensive a polymer composition of the invention comprises a blend of an organic polymer and a hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonate. a typical hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonate has the empirical formula 2 mgco3. mg (oh)2. 3h2o 3cac03 the exact molecular structures of the hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates are not known, but the proportions of the various elements require that they contain hydroxyl as well as carbonate anions ioeo they are basic carbonates, and also that they contain combined water. the hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates are commercially available, being usually referred to as "light precipitated magnesium calcium (or calcium magnesium) carbonate", although dolomite is a double magnesium calcium carbonate, it is not a hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonate and does not show the smoke-reduci properties of the latter. for use in the compositions of the present invention the particle size of the hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates should normally be of the same order as that of conventional solid fillers used in polymer compositions. preferably all particles are less than 75 microns and at least 9oqg of the particles are less than 50 microns0 the hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates are especially effective as smoke depressants for halogencontaining polymers containing plasticizers, especially phosphate ester plasticizers, but these carbonates can also be used in halogen-containing polymers with other plasticizers or, with or without plasticizers, in other polymers, for example synthetic and natural rubbers halogen-containing polymers which benefit from blending with hydrated basic magnesium calcium carbonates in accordance with the invention include polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of vinyl chloride with one or more other ethylenically unsaturated compounds copolymerisable therewith, preferably in an amount of not more than 40 molars percent relative to the vinyl chloride. suitable copolymers are those wherein the comonomer is selected from other vinyl halides such as vinyl bromide and vinyl fluoride; vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl chloroacetate and vinyl butyrate; vinyl alkyl sulfonates; vinyl ethers such as vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl isopropyl ether and vinyl chloroethyl ether; aromatic and cyclic unsaturated compounds such as styrene,
