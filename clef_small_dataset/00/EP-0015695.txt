<ABSTRACT>
conjugates of heavy atoms containing analytes or their  analogs and fluorescent molecules are covalently bonded to  macromolecular supports to minimize the interference of fluor­ escence during assays, due to non-specific binding of serum  proteins to the conjugate.

<DESCRIPTION>
method for competitive protein binding assays inhibiting non-specific interference background of the invention field of the invention it is known that when a heavy atom is able to contact a fluorescer, quenching results. this phenomenon can be employed in an assay, where a ligand or ligand analog of interest naturally has a heavy atom, such as iodine, or the heavy atom is synthetical ly introduced. by preparing a conjugate of the heavy atom containing ligand and a fluorescer, a relatively low level of fluorescence is observed, when the conjugate is irradiated with light at a wavelength which results in excitation of the fluorescer. however, when antiligand is bound to the ligand in the conjugate, a substantial enhancement of fluorescence is observed. with polyiodothyronines, the iodine present is capable of quenching fluorescence, when the polyiodothyronine is covalently bonded to a fluorescer. however, when attempting to use this reagent in a serum sample for determining polyiodothyronines, non-specific binding of serum proteins to the conjugate results in- variation in the observed f i fluorescence unrelated to the amount of ligand present. due to patient sample variation, the degree to which the observed fluorescence changes at constant ligand concentration varies with the source of the serum. therefore, it is necessary to find some means to inhibit the non-specific effect of the serum proteins on the observed results. description of the prior art u.s. patent no. 3,988,943 describes a com- petitive protein binding assay employing ligand fluorescer conjugates, where the binding of antiligand inhibits the binding of antifluorescer. u.s. patent no. 3,996,345 describes an immunoassay employing a chromophore pair, where the chromophores are related by one of the chromophores quenching the fluorescence of the other one of the chromophores, where the amount of quencher brought within quenching distance of the fluorescing chromophore is related to the amount of analyte in the sample. robbins, "thyroxine-binding proteins", trace components of plasma: isolation and clinical significance, alan, r. liss, inc., new york, page 331 (1976) postulated that the inability of prealbumin to bind thyroxine-agarose affinity gels was related to the inability of the thyroxine to orient properly in the protein binding site. co-pending application serial no. 824,576, filed august 13, 1977, teaches the use of a polyiodothyronine-fluorescer conjugate for the determination of polyiodothyronines based on the enhancement of fluorescence when anti(polyiodothyronine) binds to the pol yiodothyronine. summary of the invention an improved method is provided for fluorescent immunoassays involving a conjugate of a ligand analog with a fluorescer, where the ligand analog has a heavy atom which results in the quenching of the fluorescer. when antiligand binds to ligand, fluorescence is enhanced. in the presence of serum proteins, sample to sample iiuorescent variation is observed which interferes with the determination of analyte. the non-specific interference is substantially diminished by bonding of the ligand analog-fluorescer conjugate to a polysaccharide support. sensitive assays are provided for polyiodothyronines, as well as for serum capacity for binding thyroxine. compositions and kits are provided for use in the subject assays. description of the
