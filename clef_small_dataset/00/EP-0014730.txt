<ABSTRACT>
In a safety device for spindle-operated lifting devices, in particular two-column motor vehicle lifting platforms with a led on a spindle (1) led lifting nut (2), on which a pillar-guided pneumatic truck (4) rests and one of them also on the spindle in one Determined distance forcibly co-finishing fishing nut (7) is also provided below the fishing nut (7) a counter nut (10) at a certain distance, wherein at loading of the lifting nut (2) a self-locking between the spindle (1), the hubmut ter ( 2) and the lock nut (10) at rotation of the spindle in the direction of removal is set, which when reversing the direction of rotation of the probe for lowering the lifting device as the can be remedied. In this way, a safety device is obtained, which effective in each position of the lifting device which can be used and a subsequent lowering of the lifting device still allows, but prevented a restarting with secure heat.
