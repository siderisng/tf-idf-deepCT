<ABSTRACT>
the memory modules of a computer are provided with  means for checking the operation of the addressing circuits  under program control.  normally such checking involves writ­ ing into the memory array, reading the data and comparing  the read-out data with that originally written.  this has the  disadvantage that a large amount of temporary storage must  be provided for the information displaced from the memory  array.  further, the results may be ambiguous, in that it may be  impossible to distinguish between an error due to failure of  the addressing circuits and that due to a defect in the memory  array itself.  the invention provides a mode setting means (31) by  means of which the program is enabled to set one or more  digits in a status register (21) in the memory module, so  placing the module in a maintenance mode.  in this mode,  when a read instruction from the central processing unit (10)  is addressed to the module, instead of its being used to  address the appropriate location in the memory array (22), the  address in the instruction, or a portion of it, is returned, thus  enabling the functioning of the processing and addressing  circuits in the memory interface to be checked without involv­ ing any writing into the memory array itself.  two digit positions of the status register (21) may be  used, one of them when set causing a part of the read instruc­ tion address to be returned, and the other when set causing  the remainder of the read instruction address to be returned.   when neither digit is set memory addressing proceeds in the  normal manner.
