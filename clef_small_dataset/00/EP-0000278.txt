<ABSTRACT>
a multi-speed bicycle transmission locatable in the  pedal hub and actuable through the drive pedals.  a plurality of drive gears (92, 94, 96) are rotatable about  the drive pedal shaft (32) and can be brought into selective  engagement with the pedal shaft by means of a mechanism  including a collar 180; the axial position of the collar along  the pedal shaft determining which of the drive gears is in  driving engagement with the pedal shaft.  inclined camming  ridges (206, 208) allow the collar to be shifted axially by  reverse rotation of the pedals at either of two rotational positions  of the pedal shaft; one such position being associated  with "up-changing" the other with "down-changing" of  gear.
