<ABSTRACT>
a computerized translation method with universal appli­ cation to all natural languages is provided.  with this method,  parameters are changed only when source or target lan­ guages are changed.  the computerized method can be  regarded as a self-contained system, having been developed  to accept input texts in the source language, and look up  individual (or sequences of) textwords in various dictionaries.   on the basis of the dictionary information, sequences of oper­ ations are carried out which gradually generate the multiplic­ ity of computer codes needed to express all the syntactic and  semantic functions of the words in the sentence.  on the basis  of all the codes and target meanings in the dictionary, plus  synthesis codes of such meanings, translation is carried out  automatically.  procedures which generate and easily update  main dictionaries, idiom dictionaries, high frequency dic­ tionaries and compound dictionaries are integral parts of the  system.

<DESCRIPTION>
method using a programmed digital computer system for translation between natural languages this invention relates to a method utilizing a digital computer for translating between natural languages. attempts have been made to utilize digital computers for translating from one language to another, i.e., from a source language to a target language. the translation systems involve a programmable digital computer system along with a program for effecting the translation. the approaches used were theoretical. the theoretical language approach for syntactical analysis has not been acceptable because it starts out from linguistic assumptions instead of considering the capabilities of the programmable digital computer and approaching the translation from the computers point.of view. the idea of machine translation was conceived in 1946 by warren weaver and a.d. booth. many attempts to achieve a machine translation system and put it into operation have been made. the projects were directed toward developing linguistic theories encompassing the whole natural language and then geing to the computer. this approach inevitably sailed because the human mind cannot encompass the totality of the language. the following is a brief resume in the approaches and the theory behind them: the "general analysis technique" -gat - (institute of languages and linguistics machine translation research center, washington dc juni 1959, by peter toma, edited by j.a. mayne) used a linguistics oriented computer coding scheme. ad hoc solutions were introduced and the whole system was confined within a hollow restricted so-called simulated linguistic computer (slc)system written in octal language and not open for any further improvements. the fulcrum theory approach developed from 1959 to 1967 by the bunker-ramo corporation, usa, was directed toward solving, with a relatively small dictionary, the problems occuring in a limited russian text. no attempt was made to introduce resolution of multiple meanings; instead, several meanings were printed in the output, separated by slashes. a predictive syntax system was developed by the national bureau of standards and massachusetts institute of technology in 1960 to 1964. this approach failed because it considered only one limited path to the sentence. this system was never implemented on a larger scale, but was used just within a limited experimental environment. transformational grammar was another approach. however, this approach turned out to be absolutely incompatible with computer translation requirements. only small experimental systems have becn developed on the basis of this theory, and the had to be discontinued before any significant translation was produced. as compared to the propr art it is an object of the invention to enable assurate, fast, almost instaptang@@us translation of large volumes of texts from one source language i.e. natural language into another natural language, the so-called target language. instead of a natural language an artificial language as par example esperanto can act as source or target language as the case may be. to achieve this purpose the subject matter of the present invention is a method using a programmable digital computer system, the steps comprising a) converting a source text to be translated from visual indicia to computer

any, in a  source   i@diem   are stored in at least one dictionary  in memory;  the highfrequency dictionary includes the first  words of source language idioms and associated  therewith address linkages to second and sub  sequent words in the same idiom which are located  in the idiom dictionary, the first word and sub  sequent words, if any, of an idiom having an associ  ated target language meaning stored in association  therewith:  and  during comparison with the high frequency dictionary    comprising    the steps of:    @ a)    detecting those words that are equal and are first  words of idioms;  b) utilizing the offset address linkages to locate the  additional word or words in the   same    idiom located  in the idiom dictionary;  c) comparing the located further words in the idiom  with the words in the source text which follow the  first idiom word for an equality;  and  d) upon detecting such an equality, storing the first  idiom word together   with    the target language meaning  into the high frequency file,  c) storing each one of the second and   subsequent      idiom     words together with an idiom tag into the high  frequency file,   t    idiom

participating  words form compound expressions with the principal  word; ;  wherein during scanning   and    comparing   with    dictionaries,  information is attached to the principal word concerning  all the compound expressions   within    which the principal  word may function as key word in a compound, the attached  information containing either sequences of limited  semantic numbers or an address of an auxiliary storage  device where such information is located, and including  the additional'steps of bringing into a main working  memory from the auxiliary storage device during analyzing  the file of words, the limited semantic numbers  assigning a subject field code to the source text,  if the same compound expression of the source language  indicated by the limited semantic numbers have different  target meanings,   then selection of the correct meaning  for the compound depending upon the subject field code  in which the translation takes place.   5.) a method,
