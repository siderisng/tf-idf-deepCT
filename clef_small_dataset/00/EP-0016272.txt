<ABSTRACT>
an incandescent display system suitable for use in dis­ paying video images is disclosed.  incandescent light bulbs  are positioned closely to each other in order to achieve a high  resolution picture.  the system includes a sun screen (32)  disposed over the front of the lamps to reduce impairment of  the display image due to sunlight reflecting on the display  lamps.  the lamps are mounted in modules (36) which can be  removed from the rear of the display for periodic servicing.   the modules include openings to permit cooling air to flow  over the surface of the lamps and the display system enclos­ ure is pressurized to create a constant flow of air for this  purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
incandescent display system background of the invention this invention relates to the field of visual display devices. more specifically, it relates to the field of display devices intended for use in stadia, theaters, racetracks and as informational signs on buildings or other locations where it is desired to convey information to a large number of viewers at a significant distance from the display board. such boards are usually formed by a plurality of incandescent lamps arranged in a matrix. by selectively illuminating various lamps, information, such as written messages or video pictures, can be displayed. typically, such display boards are computer controlled and may provide for various degrees of illumination of the lamps to obtain good quality video reproduction. one factor which significantly affects the quality of the picture produced on the display board is the spacing between the lamps in the matrix. the closer together the lamps are spaced the better the picture resolution. accordingly, it is desired to space the lamps as closely together as possible. the closer the lamps are spaced, however, the more heat that is generated and, of course, such heat is destructive to the system causing premature failure of the lamps. another problem with such display boards when they are utilized out of doors is fading of the display when competing with sunlight. if the board is positioned so that the sun impinges directly on it, the image may become practically impossible to perceive by a viewer. of course, a portion of this fading cannot be prevented but, in large part, the fading is due to sunlight striking the lamp and its reflector and being reflected back towards the viewer making it hard to discern whether or not an individual lamp is illuminated. a final problem which is encountered with displays of this type is the need-to easily service the lamps on a periodic basis. in prior designs it was necessary to service the lamps from the front of the board, often in full view of the spectators' and exposed to the weather. it required the servicing, technicians be on a ladder or scaffold. also, the servicing must be performed while the board is not in use or else ,servicing procedures will interfere with the display images. it is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an improved incandescent display board in which high resolution is obtained by the use of high density spacing of the incandescent lamps. it is a further object of the invention to provide a display board in which the excessive heat caused by close spacing of incandescent lamps is dissipated by means of a pressurized cooling system. a further object of the invention is to provide a sun screen over the display board which is capable of significantly reducing the interference of sunlight while observing the display. another object of the invention is, to provide rear service access to the lamps so that they may be' serviced from inside an enclosure behind the display board protected from
