<ABSTRACT>
a novel mixture of polycyclic aromatic polycarboxylic  anhydrides carrying nuclear nitro groups which is substanÂ­ tially soluble in acetone but substantially insoluble in water  is prepared by a process which comprises nitrating a slurry  of carbonaceous material with nitric acid, recovering solids  from the nitration product extracting a acetone-soluble  mixture of carboxylic acids from the solids and dehydrating  the mixture to obtain the anhydrides.
