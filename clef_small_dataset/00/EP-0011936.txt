<ABSTRACT>
a programmable medical device, e. g.  a cardiac  pacemaker, utilizes digital circuitry 40 for controlling the pro­ vision of cardiac stimulating pulses and analog circuitry 42 for  providing clocks, an output circuit and heart activity sensing.   digital circuit 40 includes a memory in which may be prog­ rammed on a permanent or temporary basis from an external  programmer control information relating to rate, pulse width,  pulse amplitude, refractory period, sense amplifier sensitivity  and the mode of operation desired.  in addition the output can  be inhibited or a threshold margin test can be performed in  which a reduced energy output pulse is provided to check if  heart capture is lost.  the pacemaker can operate in a hys­ teresis mode and provides a high rate limit which can how­ ever be exceeded by programming.  the pacemaker further  includes means for signalling the acceptance of a program­ ming signal and means to reset the program acceptance cir­ cuit if extraneous signals are detected as programming sign­ als.  the acceptance circuit checks for the receipt of the proper  number of signals within a given time, for an access code and  correct parity.  timing is by means of a crystal oscillator and a  voltage controlled oscillator controls pulse width to obtain  energy compensation with varying battery voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
imelantable r,rogra.nmab-le electromedical device this invention relates to imolantable procraztable electromedical devices such as body tissue stinulators and more particularly an implantable cardiac pacemaker ca- pable of being programmed in a variety of different states. the art of implantable cardiac pacemakers was first disclosed by greatbatch in united states patent 3,057,356 entitled "medical cardiac pacemaker", which issued in 1962. the device disclosed by greatbatch included a relatively simple relaxation oscillator that generated electrical pulses at a fixed rate. these pulses were applied to the heart through a lead consisting of a conductor wire and an electrode to cause the heart to contract each time a pulse occurred. since 1962, many improvements to cardiac pacemakers have occurred. these improvements include increased sophistication to the circuitry, including the inclusion of a sense amplifier to interact with the oscillator in providing stimulating pulses only when needed (the demand pacemaker), features to improve the reliability and longevity of pacemakers, improved packaging techniques, better power sources and improved leads and conductors. another improvement which has occurred since greatbatch first disclosed the implantable cardiac pacemaker is means to allow the pacemaker to be reprogrammed after it has been implanted. in united states patent 3,805,796 in the name of reese terry, jr. et al, entitled "implantable cardiac pacer having adjustable operating parameters", which issued in 1974, circuitry is disclosed to allow the rate of the pacemaker to be noninvasively changed after it has been implanted. the rate varies in response to the number of times a magnetically operable reed switch is closed. the terry et al device operates by counting the number of times the reed switch is closed and storing that count in a binary counter. each stage of the counter is connected to either engage or bypass one resistor in a serially connected resistor chain, which chain is a part of the rc time constant controlling the pacemaker rate. the concept of the terry et al device has been ¯m.prsved upon by the apparatus shown in united states patent ,066,c86 in the name of john m. adams et al, entitled "programmable body stimulator", which issued in i97s, and which discloses a programmable cardiac pacemaker that responds to the application of radio frequency (per) pulse bursts while a magnetic field held in close proximity to a magnetically operated reed switch included within the pacemaker package holds the reed switch closed. in the adams t al circuit, again only the rate is programmable in response to the number of rf pulse bursts applied. the use of radio frequency signals to program cardiac pacemaker was first disclosed by wingrove in the united states patent 3,833,005 entitled "compared count digitally controlled pacemaker" which issued in 1974. the wingrove device was capable of having both the rate and pulse width programme. however, no pacemaker has ever been described which is capable of having more than two parameters programmed or selected features or tests programmed on command. such a pacemaker could be called a universally programmable pacemaker. one area where cardiac
