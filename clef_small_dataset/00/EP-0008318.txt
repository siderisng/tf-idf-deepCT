<ABSTRACT>
Chuck for lathes with clamping jaws (2) made of an axially front baking portion (2a) and an axially rear baking portion (2b), which are each guided radially adjustable in the FUT Terk body (1). The rear baking part (2b) is on the one hand with a drive member (4) for the jaw amplification, on the other hand with the front baking portion (2a) through a clutch slide (8) engaged in engagement, which is guided in the reared BAC Kenteil (2b). Therefore, the front baking portion may be decoupled to a change in the clamping turc HNNER or for a jaw exchange without the rear baking portion (2b) from its connection to the drive member (4) must be released. For actuating the clutch slide (8), a radially in the rear jaw part (2b) guided actuator (13). The actuators (13) of their ITs are adjustable simultaneously or individually one after the other through an unlocking ring (100), which is rotatably mounted coaxially on the circumference of the chuck body (1) and has the actuators (13) associated recesses (101) and dais chen lying protrusions Depending on the rotational position of the unlocking ring (100), the actuators (13) radial verse. Incidentally, the unlocking ring (100) covers the actuating limbs (13) to the outside towards unintentional direct actuation.
