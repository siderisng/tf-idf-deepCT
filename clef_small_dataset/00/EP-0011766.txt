<ABSTRACT>
Be an excavator with position reproduction of its preferably parallel, z. b. a low-spoon-forming work tool (29), which is movable by means of a pivoting force Bes (6) about a pivot joint (8) of a stalk (15), which is connected to a hinged on the bugger upper part (3) and preferably multi-part boom (7) with a Further pivot drive (13) is rotatably attached. For position reproduction such that the excavator guide at least the course of the path of the movement of the working tool is constantly displayed relative to the plane of the planum to be produced or the embankment, a pointer (64) is provided which is replaced by a handlebar (33) which a connection between the pivot joint (31) of the work tool (29) and an axis-parallel base rotary joint (34) on the pivotable excavator upper part (3) represents and that the position reproduction around the impeller of the excavator in the handlebar plane on the pointer scale and around different distances (U) of the Excavators from the working plane (42) by height adjustment of the axis-parallel rotary gels KES (34) can be corrected on the bugger upper part (3).
