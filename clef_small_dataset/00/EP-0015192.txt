<ABSTRACT>
The safety valve (10) isolates a circuit portion having a leak. It comprises a movable member (34) in a chamber (36) connected by an inlet port (42) to a circuit of use and by an outlet orifice (46) to a vacuum generator. This movable element (34), sensitive to the flow of air flowing in said chamber (36) during the appearance of a leak, is connected to a closing valve (64) and is also connected to means of means of Depreciation (48, 50, 66, 68, 70, 72). Elastic means (62) solicit the movable member (34) in a rest position in which said valve (64) is open. The movable element (34) is capable of causing a second position in which said valve (64) is closed under the effect of the air flow passing through the chamber (36). The invention applies to depression control circuits for motor vehicles, including protecting priority facilities in the event of a leak.
