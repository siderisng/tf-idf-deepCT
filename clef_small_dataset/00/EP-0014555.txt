<ABSTRACT>
novel amine salts of substituted  n-phosphonomethylureas having the formula    in which   r,r′ and r″ are independently c₁-c₄ alkyl;   a is 1 or 2 and b is 2 or 3, such that the sum of a and b is 4; and  c is 1 or 2 and d is 0 or 1, such that the sum of c and d is 2.  these compounds are useful in regulating the natural  growth or development of plants.  they may be prepared by  reacting the appropriate amine ranhb′ where b′ is 1 or2, with  an appropriate phosphonic acid.  a rate of application of 0. 11  to 22 kg/ha is suitable.  for application the compounds may be  formulated with an inert carrier or diluent.  a preferred  compound is the mono(diisopropylamine) salt of n,n-­ dimethyl- n-carboethoxymethyl-n′-phosphonomethylurea.
