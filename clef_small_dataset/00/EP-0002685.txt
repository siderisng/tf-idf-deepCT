<ABSTRACT>
The objective object relates to a compressed gas switch with a movable switching piece (3), a counter-switching piece (4) and a mashing port (10) enforceable by the movable contact piece (3) in a wall (9) subdivorous wall (9). This wall (9) serves to produce a erase gas flow introduced by the arc. In addition to the current-dependent erase gas flow according to the invention, according to the invention, a current-independent erase gas flow in the course of the switch-off processor is set in time that the counter-switching piece (4) is arranged on a piston-loaded piston (11) which loosens at the beginning of the switch-off movement of the movable contact piece (3) and thereby compressed the gas therein facing between its end face (15) facing the movable contact piece (3) and the wall (9). The compressed gas switch according to the invention can be used as a circuit breaker and as a load disconnector in high voltage nets.
