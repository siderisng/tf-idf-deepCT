<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a aid for retention improvement of floodable solids, for the dewatering acceleration of suspensions and for the more rapid preparation of industrial waters, wastewater and slurry, whereby this auxiliary is present as aqueous polymer solution of a basic water-soluble polymer and formed from a partial product A and another subproduct B It becomes that the obtained intermediate product is reacted from polyfunctional compounds. The partial product A is first formed by the action of polyhydric aliphatic amines on the reaction product of a polyethylene glycol with epichlorohydrin. Separately, the second subproduct B is formed from at least one polyalkylene polyamine and / or at least one aminocarboxylic acid or their lactam and / or hexamethylene diammonium adipate. The intermediate from the intermediate product is formed by reaction of the halogen groups of subproduct A with the semi-product B with cleavage of hydrogen halide acids. The white described above with polyfunctional compounds for reaction product C reacted intermediate AB is mainly used in the paper-making industry.
