<DESCRIPTION>
dftergent compositions containing @i@ary builder sys@ex this invention relates te detergent compositions containing, as on impro.ed builder system, a combination of polyacetal carboxylate builder meterials and aluminosili@ate materials. these compositions deliver excellent particulate soil removal performance and greasy/oily soil removal benefits. preferably, this bu@@der system is incorporated into detergent compositions conteining nonionic, and more preferably cationic/nonionic, surfactants. backgrsend art the property possessed by some materials of improving detergency levels of soaps and synthetic detergents and the use of such materials in detergent compositions is known. such cleaning boosters are called "builders" and such builders permit the attainment. of better cleaning performance than is possible when so-called unbuilt compositions are used. the behavior and mechanisms by which builders perform their function are only partially understood. it is known that good builders must be able to sequester most of the calcium and/or magnesium ions in the wash water since these ions are detrimental to the detergency process. however, it is difficult to predict which compounds possess useful combinations of builder pioperties and which compounds do not because of the complax nature of detergency and the countless factors which contribute both to overall performance results and the requirements of envirommental acceptability. sodium tripolyphosphate (stp) has been found to be a highly efficient cleaning and detergent builder and this compound has been widely used for de@ades in cleaning and detergent formulations. however, because of the recent emphasis on removing phosphates from detergent and cleaning compositions for environmental reasons, the detergent and cleaning industry is now looking for materials suitable for use as builders which do not contain phosphorus, and which are environmentally acceptable. it is difficult, however, to simultaneously deliver effective cleaning performance and biodegradabii3ty. inorganic builders other than stp are generally not satisfactory for use as a builder in detergent formulations because of their poor builder properties. sodium aluminosilicates, commonly know as zeolites, have been proposed for use in detergent formulations since they are able te soften water by-removing calcium ions; however, they are not very effective in removing magnesium ions from water. thus, it can be seen that there is a need for a new material with builder properties equivalent to stp, which does not contain phosphorus, which is water-soluble, and which achieves envi.ronniental @cceptability by being readily biodegradable. now, according to the present invention, there is provided a new builder mixture which is equal to, if not superior to, stp and the c)rgapio portion of which will depolymerize rapidly in a non-alkaline médium to form low molecular weight components which are readily biodegradable. summary of the invention the present invention' encompasses a detergent composition, which contains from 0 to about 25% phosphate materials, comprising: (a) from about 1% to about 95% by weight of sur factant; (b) from about 5% to about 99% of a detergency builder mixture consisting essentially of: - i) a water-insolubie sodium aluminosilicate material, having the formula naz(alo2)z(sio2)y#xh2o, wherein z and y are integers equal to at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is
