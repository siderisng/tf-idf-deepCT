<ABSTRACT>
a dry-break coupling for pipes used in the delivery of  hazardous fluids comprises a spigot member (10) and a complementary  socket member (11) for attachment to the respective  ends of the two pipes to be coupled.  the spigot member  carries a first poppet valve (19) which is spring-loaded  towards the mouth (14) of the spigot member to close said  mouth, and the socket member carries a second poppet valve  (28).  fastening means (45, 46, 50) are arranged to urge the  mouth of the spigot member into and secure said mouth in  sealing engagement with an outer valve seat (26) of the socket  member, and operating means (42,35) are provided to urge  the second poppet valve (28) into sealing engagement with  the inner valve seat (27) of the socket member and alternatively  to move the second popper valve forwardly to engage  and move the first poppet valve (19) out of engagement with  the mouth and so open the valves.  first interlocking means  (54,56) permit actuation of the fastening means only when the  spigot member is substantially fully inserted into the socket  member, and second interlocking means (41,44) permit actuation  of the operating means only when the spigot and socket  members are secured together in sealing engagement by the  fastening means.  suitably, sealing rings (23,26,27) of flat form are provided.
