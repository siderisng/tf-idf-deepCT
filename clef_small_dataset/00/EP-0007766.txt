<ABSTRACT>
21-hydroxypregna-1,4,17(20)- trien- 3-one 21- acylates  are converted to novel 17α, 20α-epoxypregna-1,4- dien-3-one  21-acylates (i) using a peracid, compounds i are converted to  novel 21-hydroxypregna-1,4,16- trien-3-one 21-acylates (ii)  with a hydrogen halide, and compounds ii are converted to 20,  21-dihydroxypregna-1,4,16- trien-3-ones (iii) by hydrolysis.   compounds iii are useful intermediates in the production of  anti-inflammatory agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
epoxypregnadienes, ijydroxypregnatrienes, process for tlietr preparation and process for their conversion to precur3rs of useful anti-inflammatory agents this invention relates to novel 17a, 20aepoxypregna-1,4-dien-3-one 21-acylates (i) and novel 21hydroxypregna-1,4,16-trien-3-one 21-acylates (ii), the conversion of the formula i to the formula ii compounds, the preparation of the formula i compounds from 21-hydroxypregna-1,4,17(20)-trien-3-one 21-acylates (0), and the preparation of 2d,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4,16-trien-3-ones (iii) by hydrolysis of the formula ii compounds. the formula iii compounds are useful as intermediates in the production of anti-inflammatory agents. it will be appreciated that the preparation of the formula ii compounds from the formula 0 compounds via the formula i epoxides involves a change in position of a carbon-carbon double bond. u.s. patent specification no. 3,444,216 discloses 11s,2l-dihydroxypregn-4-en-3-one. u.s. patent specification no. 3,375,261 discloses 21-acylated steroids having a double bond. the reaction of a ketone with a peracid is well known in the art and has been termed the eaeyer- villiger reaction (the oxidation of ketones with peracids). in the baeyer-villiger reaction, an oxygen atom is inserted between the carbonyl group and the alkyl portion of the ketone, thereby forming an ester. in the case of a cyclic ketone, such as a 3-keto steroid,it is well known that the resulting product is the corresponding a-ring lactone, as is shown in organic reactions 9, 73 (1957) and j. med. pharm. chem. 5, 714 (1962). page 79 of the former reference shows the exact problem that may be anticipated when epoxidising a carbon-carbon double bond in a 3-keto steroid while wishing not to affect the a-ring. page 715 of the latter reference discloses the baeyer-villiger reaction when the reactant is a a4-3-keto steroid. the lactone and subsequent side reaction products are formed. it might therefore be anticipated that a not insignificant amount of bacyer-illiger product (lactone) would be obtained when any 3-keto steroid or,more specifically, when a a4-3-keto or a als4-3-keto steroid was reacted with a peracid. in contrast, u.s. patent specification no. 3,876,633 discloses oxidation of a a17(20)-steroid to the corresponding 17a,zoa-epoxy-steroid in a 97 yield (weight). this is not unexpected because the steroid used in this process did not have a ketone group in ring a and therefore no side reaction (baeyer-villiger reaction) was possible. surprisingly it has been found that, when a compound of formula 0 is reacted with a peracid, a formula i compound is formed and the amount of any s.aeyer- villiger reaction products can be very low. it is nown that the position of carboncarbon double bonds in steroids can be changed. for example, u.s. patent specification no. 3,725,392 discloses a process for producing various 9a-fluoro-16b-alkylprednisolones, including 9a-fluoro-16ss-methylprednisolone (betamethasone), which are known to be highly active anti-inflammatory agents. the prednisolone type steroids have a a 3-keto a ring. this specification discloses that the process can be performed on a prednisolone-type compound or on a cortisone-type (e -3-keto) compound, the a double bond being put in later. the first 2 steps of the disclosed process comprise the transformation of a llss,21-dihydrox > - pregna-4,17(20)-dien-3-one to a
