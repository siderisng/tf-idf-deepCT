<ABSTRACT>
The invention is within the scope of a method for producing a titanium-containing component of a catal lysator for the polymerization of α-monoolefins according to Ziegler natta, wherein (a) a titanium-containing connection of the general formula TiCl₃. Na1C1₃ (n = a number in the range of 0.01 to 1) and (b) an ether abraded a particular genus or an ester of a particular genus with one another. The special feature of the method according to the invention is that one operates (1) with a spherical blending mill, which has a relatively high paint acceleration, (2) the mill initially charged with the titanium-containing compound (a) and, if necessary, over a certain amount of time Tighten operates, then (3) under grinding the connection (a): ether (b) corresponding to a certain molar ratio aluminum in the titanium-containing compound (a): ether (b) corresponding amount of ether or ester (b) adds continuously or in small portions, then ( 4) the whole of a certain period of time is added, then (5) - optionally - the product obtained according to (4) washed with a hydrocarbon and dries, thereafter (6) - optionally - the product obtained according to (4) or (5) for a certain period of time at a low temperature, then (7) the product obtained according to (4), (5) and (6) and (6) brings together with a liquid silo zium compound of a particular genus or liquid tin compound of a particular genus (as promoters), which bears all over a period of time and then separates into a solid-phase and a liquid-phase product, then (8) the solid-phase product obtained according to (7) with a hydrocarbon or one under (7) Listed promoter washes as well as dried, and finally (9) - reassemely - the product obtained according to (8) are postponed for a certain period of time at a low temperature. The titanium lysator components obtained in this way allow high-stereo gene polymerizates to produce high-specific yields.
