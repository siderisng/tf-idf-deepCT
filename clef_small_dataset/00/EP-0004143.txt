<ABSTRACT>
a shredding device comprises a rotor (2) having a plurality  of blades (4) mounted radially thereto, the rotor being  supported within a generally cylindrical housing (1) centered  about the axis of the rotor (2) and spaced apart from the tips  of the rotor blades (4), and the cylindrical casing presenting  an uneven interior surface (10) to the rotor for at least a part  of its circumference extending from the region of a tangentially  disposed outlet duct (9) so that material introduced into  the casing is repeatedly directed back and forth between the  rotor blades (4) and the surface (10) before being discharged  from the casing.
