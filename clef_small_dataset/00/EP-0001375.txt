<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement of luminescent diodes integrated in a semiconductor body and more particularly an arrangement suitable for the transmission of different colors. It also relates to its manufacturing process. Such an arrangement (1) is carried out on a substrate (2) for example in type N GaAs on which an epitaxial layer (3) is made, for example of the A1XGA1-XAS, also of type n. The parameter X varies in such a way that the concentration of A1 is the lowest at the surface (5), to gradually increase as you get closer to the surface (4). P-type regions are formed in the layer corresponding to different junction depths (6) and (7) respectively with contacts of borders (13) and (14). The substrate (2) is then equipped with openings (11) and (12). The junctions (8) and (9), for which parameter X is 0.5 and 0.3 respectively emit orange and red color lights. On a GAP substrate one can make a layer of GaAs1-XPX. -This arrangement can be used in display devices.
