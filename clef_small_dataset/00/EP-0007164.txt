<ABSTRACT>
in a package strapping tool for jointing metal strapping,  crimping jaws 22 on which embrace opposite edges of overÂ­ lapping ends of a loop of strapping around a package and  which are actuated through a toggle linkage 32,34 by a fluid  pressure operated piston and cylinder assembly 27 are  moved from the fully open position to grip the edges of the  overlapping strapping ends by a small partial-close cylinder  and piston assembly 71 and 72.  the partial-close piston 72  acts coaxially upon the main piston 28 and its full stroke  movement is limited to the main piston movement necessary  for the jaws to grip the strapping tightly enough to locate it  while the strapping is tensioned.  compressed air supplying  an air motor (not shown) for driving a rotary tensioning dog  (not shown) is applied simultaneously to the partial close  cylinder 72 so that the laws 22 grip the strapping from the start  of tensioning.  a valve (not shown) may be provided to put the  partial-close assembly out of action when not required.

<DESCRIPTION>
improvements in package strapping tools this invention relates to package strapping tools of the kind in which a joint between the overlapping ends of a loop of metal strapping tensioned around a package is made by a crimping jaw mechanism operated by a piston and cylinder assembly actuated by fluid pressure, usually pneumatic but sometimes hydraulic. the crimping jaw mechanism comprises a pair of crimping jaws which in use embrace opposite edges of the overlapped strapping portions (which may or may not be surrounded by a metal seal) and are pivoted about axes parallel to one another and to the edges of the strapping. usually the crimping jaws are connected to the piston of the piston and cylinder assembly by toggle linkages. such package strapping tools are referred to hereinafter as package strapping tools of the kind described. in package strapping tools of the kind described, it is known to provide a spring to act upon the piston and cause the crimping jaws to close partially and grip the edges of a seal surrounding the overlapped portions and hold the strapping in place between the jaws while the strapping is being tensioned. to overcome the friction of the piston and cylinder assembly which is necessarily large and of the linkage connecting the crimping jaws, the spring has to be heavy. the spring takes up much space and increased operating pressure (or greater piston area) is required to compress it and open the jaws fully at the end of the jointing operation so as to enable the completed joint to be separated from the tool. a package strapping tool of this kind according to the present invention is characterised by a secondary fluid pressure cylinder and piston arranged to act, when energised, upon the crimping jaw mechanism to cause the crimping jaws to grip the edges of the overlapping portions of strapping or of a seal surrounding the overlapping portions. a secondary piston and cylinder of very much smaller diameter than the main piston is adequate to move the main piston, the connecting linkage and the crimping jaws to bring the crimping jaws to the gripping position. a relatively short stroke only is needed. for eventual return to the fully open position of the jaws the secondary piston and cylinder is vented to atmosphere, or in the case of a hydraulic system is open freely to a fluid return conduit, and offers little resistance to movement of the main piston. the secondary cylinder is preferably disposed co-axially on, or in, the cylinder head of the main cylinder and arranged so that the secondary piston, or a piston rod extending from the secondary piston, can bear directly on the main piston, the secondary piston having a full stroke sufficient to move the main piston through part of its stroke away from the position corresponding to the fully open position of the crimping jaws to the position corresponding to the gripping position of the crimping jaws. in a tool which includes fluid-pressure operated

 claims   1. a package strapping tool of the kind in which a joint between the overlapping ends of a loop of metal strapping tensioned around a package is made by a crimping jaw mechanism operated by a piston and cylinder assembly actuated by fluid pressure and comprising a pair of crimping jaws which in use embrace opposite edges of the overlapped strapping portions, and are pivoted about axes parallel to one another and to the edges of the strapping characterised by a secondary fluid pressure cylinder (71) and piston (72) arranged to act, when energised, upon the crimping jaw mechanism (22) to cause the crimping jaws (34) to grip the edges of the overlapping portions of strapping or of a seal surrounding the overlapping portions.   2. a package strapping tool according to claim 1 characterised in that the secondary fluid pressure cylinder (71) and piston (72) are arranged to act, when energised, upon the crimping jaw mechanism (22) through the main piston (28) operating the crimping jaws (34).   3. a package strapping tool according to claim 2 characterised in that the secondary cylinder (71) is disposed co-axially on, or in, the cylinder head (99) of the main cylinder (29) and arranged so that the secondary piston (72), or a piston rod extending from the secondary piston (72), can bear directly on the main piston' (29), the secondary piston (71) having a full stroke sufficient to move the main piston (29) through part of its stroke, away from the position corresponding to the fully open position of the crimping jaws (34) to the position corresponding to the gripping position (figure 8) of the crimping jaws (34).      4. a package strapping tool according to any preceding claim and which includes fluid-pressure operated tensioning means for tightening the loop of strapping prior to the making of the joint between the overlapping portions characterised in that fluid-pressure supplied to operate the tensioning means (20) is applied simultaneously to operate the secondary piston and cylinder (71, 72).   5. a package strapping tool according to any preceding claim wherein means (100) is provided for putting the secondary piston and cylinder out of action when the partial close action is not required.
