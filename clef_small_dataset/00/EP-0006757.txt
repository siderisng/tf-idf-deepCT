<ABSTRACT>
an elongate dental tool, one end of which is charged with a catalyst in a binder material, is used to mix the co-reactive parts of a reactive mixture, e. g. , a dental filling composition.  preferably, the charged catalyst is one part of a two-part catalyst system, and the binder is a monomeric or prepolymeric component of the reactive mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
d7ntal mixing tool ier catalyzed two-paw'1 co?w1rtons this invention relates to a dental tool for handmixing catalyzed compositions immediately prior to their use. it is particularly useful in connection with dental filling compositions and will be described in that context. it is to be appreciated, however, that the scope and spirit of the invention extend beyond the field of dental filling compositions. it is known to present a catalyzed dental filling composition as a pair of pastes which have to be mixed together before application to a cavity. for reasons connected with their manufacture, it is not possible to color the members of the pair identically; the mixture of the two is accordingly of a third color, and the same is true of the cured composition, which makes it difficult to match the filling color to the patients' teeth. it is also known to present a catalyzed dental filling composition as a paste and a liquid, and to require that a small volume of the liquid be added to and mixed with the paste to effect cure. thus, with a two-part catalyst system comprising, for example, an amine and a peroxide, one part is present in the paste and the other in the liquid. it is difficult, however, to meter the small quantities of liquid involved, and it is difficult to produce a reliably leakproof applicator. moreover the mixture of paste and liquid, freshly made, tends to a viscosity of the order to 100,000,poise, which is undesirably low (200,000 - 400,000 poise is easier to handle and retains its shape better on molding), and even this is only achieved by using a paste of such very high viscosity (500,000 - 900,000 poise) that it is difficult to mix with the liquid. it is also known to present a catalyzed dental filling composition as a paste and a small sheet of paper which contains, in coated or impregnated form, sufficient catalyst or catalyst component for a single dental filling. the paper sheets are supplied as a booklike pad with leaves which can be torn off, and which are discarded after use. a charge of paste, sufficient for one filling, is placed on a sheet of paper and kneaded or worked to contact it with the catalyst. this presentation of the dental composition has at least three drawbacks, viz. a) it is necessary but difficult and timeconsuming to spread and mix the paste over the entire surface of one side of the paper; b) owing to the normally abrasive nature of the paste, an undesirably high proportion of paper fibers is incorporated into the mixture, leading to mechanical weakness in the cured filling; c) curing results are erratic: some fillings fail to cure satisfactorily despite careful handling. it is known further to present a catalyzed dental filling composition as a paste and a separate, microencapsulated catalyst to be mixed with the paste using sufficient shear action in the mixing to rupture the microcapsules, thereby liberating the catalyst. a drawback to this presentation

<CLAIMS>
what we claim is:    i. an elongate dental tool having two ends, one of said ends adapted to function as a handle, the other of said ends having adhered thereto a catalyst-containing composition   comprising    a firm, nontacky binder material containing said catalyst, said tool adapted for mixing coreactive materials and thereby subjecting them to the catalytic influence of said catalyst.   2. a tool according to claim 1, wherein the binder is one of the core active materials.   3. a tool according to claim 1, wherein the catalyst is dissolved in the binder.   4. a tool according to claim 1, wherein the catalyst is dispersed in the binder.   5. a tool according to claim 1, wherein the binder is a   nonreactive    material.   6. a method for catalyzing a reactive mixture comprising mixing said mixture with the tool of claim   l.
