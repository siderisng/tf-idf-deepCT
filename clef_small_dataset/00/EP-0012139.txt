<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a therapeutic agent for  stimulating the immune response in a mammal.  the novel  immunostimulant is a compound of the formula:    wherein n is the integer 1 or 2, r is hydrogen or methyl,  and r′ is alkyl having up to 4 carbon atoms, or a pharma­ ceutically acceptable acid-addition salt thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
title: therapeutic agent for stimulating the immune response in a ma1jimal this invention relates to novel agents for stimulating the irtirteune response in a mammal. in u.s. patent no. 3740403 there are disclosed 3, 6-bis(dialkylaminoalkoxy) acridines and acid-addition salts thereof which may be represented by the following structural formula: emi1.1 wherein n is the integer 1 or 2; r is hydrogen or methyl; and r' is a lower alkyl group having up to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and sec-butyl. u.s. patent no. 3740403 teaches that the compounds of formula i possess antiviral activity as demonstrated in mice injected with ld95 doses of columbia sk virus. however, the u.s. patent does not teach the use of the formula i compounds in any therapeutic method for the treatment of the human or animal body. in accordance with the present invention it has now been discovered that compounds of formula i, and pharmacologically acceptable acid-addition salts thereof, can be used to stimulate the immune response in a warmblooded animal. the compounds of formula i are organic bases and thus are capable of forming acid-addition salts with a variety of organic and inorganic salt-forming reagents. thus, acid-addition salts, formed by admixture of the organic free base with up to two equivalents of an acid, suitably in a neutral solvent, are formed with such acids as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfamic, citric, malic, fumaric, tartaric, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, and related acids. the acid-addition salts of these compounds are, in general, crystalline solids relatively soluble in water, methanol and ethanol but relatively insoluble in non-polar organic solvents such as diethyl ether, benzene, toluene, and the like. for purposes of this invention, the free bases are equivalent to their non-toxic acid-addition salts. the compounds of formula i may be prepared by the process described in u.s. patent no. 3740403 aforesaid. the compounds of formula i are active as immunostimulants when tested according to the following procedures: (a) rauscher leukemia virus rauscher leukemia virus is inoculated intraperitoneally into balb/c mice. the virus inoculum is a 20% (w/v) spleen extract made from 21-day infected spleens of balb/c mice. all mice are within a three gram weight range, with a minimum weight of 18 g., and all mice are of the same sex, usually male. sheep red blood cells are injected intraperitoneally on the seventh day. there are 5 mice per test group. the test compound is administered orally on the sixth day as 0.5 ml. (in 0.2% noble agar in saline) at a dose of 37.5 to 600 mg/kg of body weight, and again on the seventh and eighth day, in the same manner. on the fourteenth day the mice are weighed and bled from the retro-orbital sinus. the blood is pooled and the harvested serum is stored at 400 for 24 hours. hemagglutinin tests are performed by standard procedures using the microtiter plate technique. acceptable hemagglutinin titer for leukemic (immunosuppressed) mice is ±- 1:128. positive control compounds are poly i:c (polyinosinic acid:-polycytidylic acid)
