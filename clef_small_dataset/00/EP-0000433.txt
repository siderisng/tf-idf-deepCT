<ABSTRACT>
a fluid catalytic cracking unit having a riser reactors is  equipped with multiple nozzles for introducing the cracking  feed into the riser.  the unit is operated with preheat of the  feed to at least 475Â°f whereby the efficiency of gasoline  production is enhanced.  the amount of hot regenerated catalyst dispersed in the  cracking feed is controlled to maintain a predetermined  temperature at a predetermined point in the reactor.
