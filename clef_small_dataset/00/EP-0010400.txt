<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus and method for feeding a flexible elongate  member, e. g.  pile weatherstrip, into a groove in an elongated  member, the apparatus being capable of being driven by an  electric motor or drill and including a pair of rollers (11,17)  defining a nip through which the pile is driven into an outlet  guide (43) with which the groove in the elongated member is  alinged at the downstream end thereof.  it is preferred that two  sets of roller nips are provided, there being a common roller  for each nip and there being an inlet guide (39) to direct the  pile weatherstrip into a first nip, and an intermediate guide  (41) to direct the weatherstrip from the first nip to the second  nip and hence into the outlet guide (43).  preferably, the roller common to each pair is driven via a  toothed belt, and the other two rollers can be moved towards  or away from said common roller.  preferably, this roller has a  grooved periphery to receive the pile of the weatherstrip and  all the rollers are knurled.
