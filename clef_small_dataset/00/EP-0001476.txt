<ABSTRACT>
a steerable vehicle has at least one rigid axle carrying  steerable wheels, a steering box secured to the axle, and  an input rotatable relative to the housing of the steering  box with steering control means having first and second  relatively rotatable parts, a connection between the first  part of the steering control means and the housing of the  box having a first element (56) arranged to take up an  average position between the first part (41) and the housing  (43) during relative rotation there between, and a differential  gearing (51, 52, 54) between the second part (45)  of the control means and the input (55) to the steering  box, the differential gearing having a second element (52)  which takes up an average position between the second  part(45) and input (55) during relative rotation, the first  and second elements (56, 52) being connected for simultaneous  movement.  this prevents steering of the wheels  due to relative roll occurring between the steering box and  the control means.
