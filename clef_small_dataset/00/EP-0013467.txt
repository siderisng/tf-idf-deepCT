<ABSTRACT>
a process for the conversion of an acyclic conjugated  diolefinic hydrocarbon containing from 4 to 10 carbon atoms,  for example butadiene, to furan or an alkyl-substituted furan,  which comprises reacting the conjugated diolefin with  molecular oxygen in the liquid phase characterized in that the  reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent in the pres­ ence of a catalyst having the composition:   [rxm (l)y]z   in which   r represents an organic ligand which is an alkyl, aryl, alkene,  diene, triene, or alkyne radical containing from 1 to 8 carbon  atoms;   l represents a ligand which is carbon monoxide and a  halogen;   m represents a transition metal or mixture of transition metals  from groups ivb, vb, vib, viib and viii of the periodic classifi­ cation of elements;   x is 0 to 2;   y is 0 to 6;   x + y is 1 to 6; and   z is 1 to 6.  the reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of  from 20 to 200°c.
