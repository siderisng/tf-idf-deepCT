<ABSTRACT>
a device for the removal of waste metabolites, especially  nitrogenous poisons, from for example a hemofiltrate from a  patient who suffers from uremia.  the device comprises three  columns (8, 9, 17), which are packed with activated carbon (10,  11 and 18), and of which two (8, 9) are parallelly coupled to  each other.  these two columns are adapted to be alternat­ ingly cooled and warmed for adsorption and desorption,  respectively, while the third column (17) is adapted to be  permanently cooled.  while one (18) of said two columns (8, 9)  is cooled and throughflown by hemofiltrate for adsorption the  other one (9) is exposed to warming (desorption), flushing  and precooling.  when said one column (8) is saturated with  waste metabolites (urea) the hemofiltrate flowing is switched  over so that said hemofiltrate is passed through the other,  precooled column (9), whereby said first column is kept at rest  and then in turn warmed, flushed and precooled.  by  regenerating one of the two parallelly coupled columns at the  same time as the other column is used for adsorption the total  treatment time for the removal of between 20 and 30 grams  urea can be reduced to 3-4 hours.  the device conveniently comprises a disposable tube set  (1-6,8,9,12-14,17) interconnecting said three columns (8,9,  17) and being adapted to be attached to a patient (7).  said tube  set as well as said columns are to be disposed after a whole  in treatment.
