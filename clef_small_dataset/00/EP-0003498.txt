<ABSTRACT>
decorative and safety wheel tubular member, particularly  adapted for insertion between the spokes of bicycles,  motorcycles and the like comprising an elongated tubular  flexible member of a diameter to engage the inner portions  of the spokes of the wheel adjacent the rim and of a length  to close on itself within the wheel and around the hub  thereof, with means such as a plug or sleeve to hold the  ends of the member together in abutting relationship.  a  narrow strip of material having a reflective outer surface is  provided in spiral fashion on the outer surface of the elongated  member such that when a wheel carrying the elongated  member is rotated at a low speed, the elongated  member appears to an observer from substantially any  position to have its entire outer surface covered with reflective  material.
