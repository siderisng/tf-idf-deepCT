<ABSTRACT>
a stereoscopic film slide and a viewer are disclosed.   the slide (22) comprises a carrier (140) and a plurality  of pairs of stereoscopic photographic transparencies (142)  arranged in two superposed rows in which the transparencies  in the respective rows are inverted with respect to one  another so that one of the rows can be viewed in a slot (48) in  the viewer (20) in which the slide (22) is longitudinally displaceable  and the second row of transparencies can be viewed  with the slide (22) in a second position in the viewer in  which the slide is inverted compared to its first position.  the  viewer (20) is assembled from a cardboard blank (52) and  includes front and rear portions (24 and 26, respectively)  defining therebetween a slot (48) to receive the slide (22).   the slot (48) has open ends and an open top and the rear  portion (26) of the viewer is displaceable rearwardly to open  the slot (48) to a generally v-shaped configuration for insertion  of the film slide (22) into and removal thereof from the  slot.  the rear portion (26) of the viewer is maintained in its  normal position by an elastic tension member (132) which  extends diagonally of said portion.
