<ABSTRACT>
A telescopic leg suspension comprising a lower element, wheel holder, connected by a lever articulated to the structure of the vehicle, an upper articulated element on the structure and serving as guide to the lower element, these two elements that can slide and possibly rotate One relative to the other, and means for acting liquid under pressure between the elements so that the liquid tends to axially spread by each other these two elements. One of the two elements E1 (E2) comprises a tubular member 3 provided, at one end, of a bore 4 and a piston 5 to slide in such a wite 4, the pressure liquid being contained in this organ 3, while the other element E2 (E1) comprises a cylinder 6 surrounding the member 3, this cylinder being closed at one end by a bottom 7 against which the piston 5 the guidance between the two elements E1, E2 being made between the cylinder 6 and the organ 3.
