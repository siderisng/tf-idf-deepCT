<ABSTRACT>
waterproof filling medium, used in telecommunication  cables with cellular insulation of polyethylene or polypropylene,  is based on a mineral oil (with or without a gelling  agent such as microcrystalline wax) and includes two non-polar  additives.  the first is soluble and of low enough molecular  weight to reduce significantly the osmotic pressure of the  base, but does not diffuse into the insulation below 80Â°c; and  the second is polymeric and of high enough molecular weight  to increase the resistance to flow to obtain the required non-draining  property.  filling of cells in the insulation is inhibited.
