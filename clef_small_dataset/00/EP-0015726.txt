<ABSTRACT>
a casing joint 17 connected in a casing string in a well  bore 11 includes a rubber lining 26 forming obstruction means  for interrupting the passage of a fluid displacement plug 24  during a cementing operation in the well bore.  the displace­ ment plug 24 is driven down the casing string by displacement  fluid 25 and forces cementing fluid 23 ahead of the plug and  back up the outside of the casing string.  when the plug 24  reaches the lining 26 a preassure surge is detected at the  pumping operation.  the detection of plug position is used to  indicate termination or near termination of cementing, or to cal­ ibrate the pumping mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
i.iiprov9.rcitsi iiss and 'r7xatjnv, to poiping flicds in well roles the present invention relates to pumping fluids in well bores, and 15 concerned in particular but not exclusively with methods for use in connection with cementing operations in tubular structures in well bores, and components for use in such methods. operations occuring in the drilling of bores for wells such as oil, gas or water wells, include the cementing into the bore of a hollow cylindrical steel casing formed of a series of lengths of casing known as casing joints, joined together to give a continuous casing known as a casing string. the cementing process normally occurs at the end of drilling of each stage of the bore of the well, or formation as the bore is known. when a stage of the well has been drilled as far as possible without danger of collapse of the formation, the drill string is removed and is replaced by a casing string having an outer diameter less than the formation. during the removal of the drill string and insertion section by section of the casing string, the formation is maintained by the weight of a packing fluid containing for example barium sulphate among other constituents. this fluid is pumped down the drill and up to the surface during drilling to carry away the cuttings, cool the bit and hold back the pressure from the formation(among other functions), and is retained in the formation while the casing is placed in the bore. when the casing string is in position it is cemented in place by pumping down the hollow centre of the casing a cementing fluid which usually comprises a cement and water slurry. the cementing fluid displaces the packing fluid and passes out of the casing string at the bottom of the bore and is forced back up the outside of the casing string to displace packing fluid from the annular space between the outer wall of the casing and the inside of the bore. the bottom of the casing is terminated by an element known as a float shoe or float valve resting at the bottom of the formation. ideally, just sufficient cementing fluid is pumped into the casing to fill the annular space around the casing back to the required height(which may be to the top of the formation) with virtually no cement in the bottom of the inside of the casing. this operation is attempted by placing in the casing string above a calculated quantity of cementing fluid a fluid displacement plug which is driven along the casing string by pumping a displacement fluid under pressure behind the plug. the displacement fluid may be similar to the packing fluid, for example a slurry of water, barium sulphate and other materials. thus the cementing fluid is carried along in front of the plug and the displacement fluid behind the plug is pumped under pressure to drive the plug along. considerable skill is required during the cementing operation to decide when
