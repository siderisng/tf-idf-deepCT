<ABSTRACT>
a computer (14) carried aboard the vehicle has inputs  from transducers (26,12,29,20) indicating, as well as engine  speed, extent of operation of the accelerator pedal and road  speed of the vehicle, the extent of operation of the brake  control, and has outputs (9,31,22) connected to transducers to  control throttle, gear selection and also to the braking system  of the vehicle.  this arrangement allows, during normal driv­ ing, the relief of drag when the vehicle is moving faster than  the accelerator setting appears to demand by the modification  of gear selection either to a very high ratio or to put the  gearbox into neutral.  it also, by the provision of the transducer  (22) associated with the braking system, permits the modifica­ tion of braking effort resulting from pressure on the brake  pedal to take into account a braking effort derived from the  engine.
