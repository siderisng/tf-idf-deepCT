<ABSTRACT>
a gas burner system for providing a thin, flat flame for  use in a long narrow combustion space, has a first air supply  plenum which has a long narrow rectangular cross-section,  which is placed above a second plenum or combustion  chamber of substantially the same cross-section.  at the  junction between the first and second plena there are  longitudinal projections inwardly from both long walls of the  second plenum, forming a long narrow rectangular inlet to  the second plenum.  a burner assembly comprising an  elongated flattened pipe having a plurality of short air baffles  welded on each side is supported in this narrow inlet to the  second plenum and substantially in the center thereof.  the  overall width of the burner assembly is less than that of the  inlet so that there are two longitudinal gaps between the  burner assembly and the projections for the passage of  combustion air.  there are two sets of ports in the lower edge  of the flattened pipe.  a first set provides downstreamwardly  and outwardly projecting ports for the passage of the major  gas flow.  a second set of smaller gas ports are drilled  substantially laterally to the vertical and the gas therefrom  flows into the space behind the air baffles where a stable,  sheltered flame can be provided, for continuous ignition of  the major flow of gas issuing at high velocity from the first  set of ports, and turbulently mixing with the air flow  downwardly through the gaps.  the walls of the second  plenum and projections can be of conventional refractory  material, or they can be of metal which is water cooled.
