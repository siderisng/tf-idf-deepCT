<ABSTRACT>
a data processor having a multi-port storage circuit for  storing a binary logic state and having first and second termi­ nals for providing a differential output signal representative of  the binary logic state which is stored.  a first and second pair of  mosfet devices selectively couple the first and second ter­ minals to a first and second pair of conductors (130, 132) for  sensing the binary logic state represented by the differential  output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
multi-port ram structurefor data processorregisters technical field this invention relates generally to data processors ana random access memories an3 more particularly to a multi-port r < am structure employed to implement the ¯e###st#rs within a data processor. background art the field of single-chip, large scale integration (lsi) microprocessors is advancing at an incredible rate. progress in the underlying semiconductor technology, os, is driving the advance. every two years, circuit densities are improving by a factor of 2, circuit speeds are increasing by a factor of 2, and at the same time speed-power products are decreasing by a factor of 4. finally, yield enhancement techniques are driving down production costs and hence product prices, thereby increasing demand and opening up new applications and markets. one effect of this progress in semiconductor technology is advancement in lsi microprocessors. the latest generation, currently being introduced by several companies, is an order of magnitude more powerful than the previous generation, the 8-bit microprocessors of three or four years ago. the new microprocessors have 16-bit data paths and arithmetic capability. they directly address multiple-megabyte memories. in terms of functional capability and speed, they will outperform all but the high end models of current 16-bit minicomputers. a particular data processor, which incorporates the present invention, supports an instruction set which consists of general single and dual operand instructions involving byte (8 bits), word (16 bits) or double word operands. operations are generally memory-to-register, register-to-memory, or register-to-r#gister. in addition to standard instructions such as add, compare, and shift, this particular data processor is designed to support such instructions as load and store multiple registers, multiply and divide, and various forms of bit manipulation. the data processor provides eight 32-bit address manipulation registers and eight 32-bit manipulation registers. address registers allow 16-bit and 32-bit operations, and data registers allow 8-, 16-, and 32-bit operations. all address and data registers are accessible to the programmer. in addition, there is a program counter with limited user accessibility, and there are several registers not available to the user which are used for temporary storage during instruction execution. prior art data processors are known which use a basic register cell comprising first and second mosfet inverters and a mosfet feedback device for coupling the output of the second inverter to the input of the first inverter. an example of a data processor which employs such a register cell is the mc6800 microprocessor supplied by motorola, inc. which is generally described in u.s. patent no. 4,004,281, "microprocessor chip register bus structure invented by bennett et al and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. the register cell used within the mc6800 microprocessor employs a clocked feedback technique wherein the gate terminal of the feedback mosfet device is coupled to a clocking signal. another example of a data processor which employs a basic register cell including a feedback mosfet device is the mc6801 microcomputer supplied by motorola, inc. the register cell used within this microcomputer includes a feedback mosfet device having its gate
