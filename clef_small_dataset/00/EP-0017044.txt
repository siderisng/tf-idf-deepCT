<ABSTRACT>
full aperture focus detection apparatus produces an  amplified differential signal having a magnitude and a  polarity indicative of the extent and direction, relative to the  image plane of a projection lens, that a selected portion of  the upper surface of a semiconductive wafer is out of focus  with respect to that image plane.  lens positioning apparatus  moves the projection lens by an amount and in a direction  corresponding to the magnitude and polarity of this signal to  position the image plane of the projection lens at the  selected portion of the upper surface of the semiconductive  wafer.  a chuck on which the semiconductive wafer is held  may be differentially leveled at three selected off-center  loations by leveling apparatus so that the chuck may be  raised or lowered at any of those locations to position the  selected portion of the upper surface of the semiconductive  wafer in a plane parallel to the image plane of the projection  lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
optical focusing system background and summary of the invention this invention relates generally to optical focusing systems of the type utilizing a reduction lens system for photometrically printing an image of a first object such as a reticle upon a second object such as a semiconductor wafer and, more specifically, to apparatus utilized in such systems to achieve precise focusing or positioning of the top surface of the wafer at the image plane of a projection lens of the lens system. in the semiconductor industry, reduction lens systems are employed in the fabrication of photomasks to print an array of microcircuitry on each photomask. a set of#such photomasks, each bearing an array of microcircuitry of a different level, is typically employed in the fabrication of integrated circuits from a semiconductive wafer. in the course of this fabrication, the semiconductive wafer is sequentially aligned with each photomask and a contact exposure is made at each processing level to print the array of microcircuitry on the photomask onto the semiconductive wafer. alternatively, similar reduction lens systems may be directly employed in an exposure operation to initially print the array of microcircuitry directly upon the semiconductive wafer rather than the photomask, thereby eliminating the photomask step entirely. in either case, the top surface of either the photomask or the wafer must be precisely focused, automatically, at the image plane of the projection lens of the lens system. in practice, however, precise focus of semiconductive wafers is very difficult to achieve because of surface irregularities present in the surface of the unprocessed (unexposed) wafer or introduced as a - result of various processing steps,resulting in mottled exposure of photoresist and unresolved microcircuit images formed upon the wafer. known prior-art systems do not adequately provide for detection of focus error due, for example, to imprecise focusing of the image plane of the projection lens at the edges of the exposure (i.e., at the edges of the portion of the wafer being exposed, which edges are sometimes not in the same horizontal plane as the center of the wafer). one such system is described, for example, in u.s. patent no. 3,722,996 entitled optical pattern generator or repeating projector or the like issued march 27, 1973, to wayne l. fox. other prior-art systems also do not adequately provide for detection of focus error because they often utilize sample areas which are too small (e.g., extremely small sample areas of about 10 microns in diameter are generally used). one such system is described for example in u.s. patent no. 4,128,847 entitled optical reading device comprising a focusing detection device issued december 5, 1978 to gerald roullet and jean-pierre bortuzzo. what would be useful in providing improved microcircuit exposures, therefore, is a system that would be capable of detecting when a selected portion of a wafer, even a portion close to an edge of the wafer, is out of focus due to variations in thickness or flatness of the wafer or other factors, and capable of correcting said out-of-focus
