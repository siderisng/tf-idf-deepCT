<ABSTRACT>
a solid solution of a quinacridonequinone with a  stabilizer selected from the group consisting of 2-anilino­ acridone, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-anilinoacridone, 6-anilino­ quinolone and 2-aminoacridone of improved lightfastness  is provided which displays improved dispersibility while  still maintaining a high degree of transparency in auto­ motive finishes when post-treated with a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
title light stable quinacridonequinone yellow pigment description technical field among the various known quinacridone derivatives are the quinacridonequinones. quinacridone quinones have been described in the literature as having utility as pigments because of their intense yellow color and low solubility in organic media. as a practical matter, however, compositions pigmented with quinacridonequinones have proven to have extremely poor lightfastness as compared to those pigmented with quinacridone or other quinacridone derivatives. background art while it has been disclosed (u.s. patent 3,160,510) that quinacridonequinone could be used as one component of a solid solution of two or more quinacridone derivatives, such compositions have marked limitations since the ingredients are colored compounds which produce a red color in the final composition. more recently colorless stabilizers, such as n,n-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (u.s. patent 3,341,345) and 6,13-dihydroquinacridone (u.s. patent 3,748,162), have been used in solid solution with quinacridonequinone. disclosure of the invention it has now been found that quinacridone quinones may be stabilized by forming a solid solution with a compound selected from the group consisting of 2-anilinoacridone; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-anilinoacri- done; 6-anilinoquinolone; and 2-aminoacridone or mixtures thereof. the structures of these compounds are as 2-anilinoacridone emi2.1 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-anilinoacrione emi2.2 6-anilinoquinolone emi2.3 2-aminoacridone emi2.4 by quinacridonequinones are meant compounds of the fol iowing structural formula emi2.5 where x is selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, a lower alkyl, a lower alkoxy and combinations of these groups and m is an integer from 0-2. the solid solutions of this invention are characterized by outstanding lightfastness and by superior two-tone effect in metallized finishes. the compositions of this invention comprise solid solutions of (a) 1-208 by weight of the stabilizers or a mixture of the stabilizers; and (b) 80-998 by weight of quinacridonequinone. of the enumerated stabilizers, 2-anilinoacridone is the preferred stabilizer because it imparts superior lightfastness properties to the quinacridonequinone. the preferred range of stabilizer is from 10-158 by weight of quinacridonequinone and stabilizers. the lower limit is provided to insure good long-term lightfastness properties while the upper limit although not critical to lightfastness is provided primarily for economic reasons. the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-anilinoacridone can be prepared by a process comprising (1) condensing 2-cyclohexanonecarboxy late ester of the formula emi3.1 with n-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid at a temperature of from 80-1500c at sufficient pressure to remove byproduct water to form a t(phenyl)aminolphenyl}aminocyclo- hexenecarboxylate ester of the formula emi4.1 wherein r is as above; ; (2) cyclizing the 2-(4'-t(phenyl)amino]- phenyl)aminocyclohexenecarboxylate ester by heating at a temperature of 180-3000c in an inert high boiling liquid to obtain 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro 2-anilinoacridone of the formula emi4.2 the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-anilinoacridone can be converted to 2-anilinoacridone by a process comprising dehydrogenating 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-anilinoacridone by heating in an inert high boiling liquid in the presence of a catalytic amount of a supported palladium or platinum catalyst. the condensation of the cyclohexanonecarbox late ester with n-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine is conducted in the presence of a strong acid catalyst at 80-1500c and at a pressure that permits the removal of byproduct water. representative examples of the
