<ABSTRACT>
a flush valve mechanism for controlling the flushing  action of water through the water outlet (214) of a flush  cistern is provided.  the mechanism comprises a water  outlet valve (218) liftable off the water outlet to effect the  flushing action and a buoyant, valve-engaging assembly  (204) adapted to move independently of the water outlet  valve by virtue of its buoyancy.  the water outlet valve  having an effectively negative overall buoyancy when the  cistern is at least partially full.  the valve-engaging  assembly comprses pivotably mounted buoyant lever  (206) having at least one arm with a buoyant means (208)  attached at one end thereof adjacent the bottom of the  cistern and is provided with means (256) at its other end  for selectively engaging the valve.  the assembly further  comprises restraining means (244) having a first position  normally engaging and restraining the buoyant lever with  the buoyant means in close proximity to the cistern bottom  and the engaging means in disengaged relationship to  the valve.  the restraining means (244) are displaceable  to assume a second position freeing the buoyant lever  (206) and allowing the same to engage and to exert a  maintaining force on the water outlet valve (218) at the  completion of the lifting thereof to overcome its negative  buoyancy and to hold it open until the completion of the  flushing action.
