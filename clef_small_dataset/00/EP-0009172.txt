<ABSTRACT>
for the temporary shutting off of gas pipelines under low to medium pressures, e. g.  for the purpose of carrying out repair tasks, so- called shut-off blisters are used which, after insertion in the gas line, are inflated with a gas from the outside which is at a pressure greater than that prevailing in the line.  the double-walled shut-off blister according to the invention has the following features: the outer sleeve consists of gas-proof, elastically expandable material, preferably of rubber, while the inner sleeve consists of pressure- resistant and gas-proof material which is only slightly expandable, preferably of plastic-coated cloth.  the diameter of the outer sleeve in the inflated state, without excess pressure, is at most of equal size, but is preferably 5 to 40% smaller, and the diameter of the inner blister, under the same conditions, is at least of equal size, but is preferably 15 to 60% greater than that of the pipeline to be shut off.  this design achieves a very good sealing effect between the inner wall of the pipe and the shut-off blister with a relatively low overpressure in the shut-off blister.
