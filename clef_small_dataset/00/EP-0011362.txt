<ABSTRACT>
zeolite zsm-5 is conventionally crystallized in the pres­ ence of substantial amount of tetraalkylammonium cations,  the alkyl groups of which contain 2 to 5 carbon atoms, such  as tetrapropylammonium, and contains tetraalkylam­ monium cations as well as a substantial amount of sodium  ions which latter must be removed to enhance catalytic activ­ ity.  by synthesizing the zeolite in the presence of a solution of  an alkyl amine and an alkyl halide, from a specifically defined  reaction mixture, it is obtained in very low sodium content  and small crystal size.

<DESCRIPTION>
method for synthesis of zeolite zsm-5 the present invention relates to a method for synthesis of zeolite zsm-5. zeolite zsm-5 in its conveniently synthesized aluminosilicate form has the composition, expressed in mole ratios of oxides in the anhydrous state: eo.9+- 0.23m 2/n 0 : a1203: xsio2 wherein m is selected from tetraalkylammonium cations the alkyl groups of which contain 2-5 carbon atoms, and alkali metal cations (especially sodium); and x is at least 5; said cations having the valence n. it has a distinctive x-ray diffraction pattern. its original cations can be exchanged to confer exceptional catalytic properties. the zeolite and its conventional preparation are the subject of u.s. specification 3;702;886. zeolite zsm-5 has been conventionally prepared by forming a mixture of alumina; silica; alkali metal oxide, water and tetraalkylammonium compounds such that the mixture has a composition; in terms of mole ratios of oxides; falling within the following range: sio2/a1203 5-100 h20/sio2 0.7 - 3000 m/sio2 0.3 - 3.0 r/sioz 0.01 - 2.0 wherein m is an alkali metal ion and r is a tetraalkylammonium cation; the alkyl groups of which contain 2-5 carbon atoms. the reaction mixture is maintained at a temperature of from about 1000f to about 4000f until crystals of zsm-5 are formed. zeolite zsm-5 possesses a definite distinguishing crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern shows the following significant lines: table i interplanar spacing relative intensity 11.1 + 0.3 s 10.0 + 0.3 s 7.4 + 0.2 w 7.1 + 0.2 w 6.3 + 0.2 w 6.04 + 0.2 w 5.56 + 0.1 w 5.01 # 0.1 w 4.60 # 0.08 w 4.25 # 0.08 w 3.85 # 0.07 vs 3.71 # 0.05 s 3.04 # 0.03 w 2.99 # 0.02 w 2.94 # 0.02 w these values were determined by standard technique. the radiation was the k-alpha doublet of copper, and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart open recorder was used. the peak heights, i, and the positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the bragg angle; were read from the spectrometer chart. from these; the relative intensities; 100i/io is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d (obs.); the interplanar spacing in a, corresponding to the recorded lines; were calculated. in table i the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols w = weak; s - strong and vs = very strong. it should be understood that this x-ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of zsm-5 zeolites. ion exchange of the sodium ion with cations reveals substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample, as well as if it has been subjected to thermal treatment. according to the present invention a method for synthesis of zeolite zsm-5 comprises preparing a mixture containing sources of an alkali metal oxide, of an aluminum oxide, of a silicon oxide, a
