<ABSTRACT>
a variable ratio rack and pinion gear having a rack bar (1)  the rack (8) of which engages with the pinion (10) so that  rotation of the pinion (10) displaces the rack member (1) lonÂ­ gitudinally relative to the housing (6).  a yoke (25) supports the  member (1) with its teeth in engagement with the pinion (10)  and straddles the member (1) to restrain displacement of that  membmer (1) relative to the housing (6) in a direction parallel  to the axis of rotation for the pinion (10).  the rack member (1)  has a longitudinally extending non-rectilinear grooved track  (14) which is engaged by a peg (17) rotatably carried in a  mounting block (21).  the block (21) retains the yoke (25) in the  housing (6) with the peg (17) located within and extending  through the yoke (25).  the peg (17) engages with the track (14)  so that during longitudinal displacement of the rack member  (1) the reaction between the groove (14) and peg (17) imparts  controlled rotation to the member (1) to vary the ratio of the  gear.
