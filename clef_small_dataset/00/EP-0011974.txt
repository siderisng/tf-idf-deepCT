<ABSTRACT>
a programmable device which is capable of being prog­ rammed by its user in the field but which is also capable of  being tested during manufacture, before it is programmed,  has a memory cell array (1), including regular bit lines (11),  regular word lines (12), regular memory cells (13) connected  at the crossing points of the regular bit lines (11) and regular  word lines (12), test bit or test word lines, and nonconducting  and conducting test memory cells (16) connected at the cros­ sing points of the regular bit or regular word lines and test  word line (15) or test bit line (14).  the conductivity of the test  memory cells (16) is determined by the "1" or "0" of the  address signal by which the test word line (15) or test bit line  (14) to which the test memory cell is connected is selected so  that peripheral circuits (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of the device may be  tested for all of their functions before programming the regu­ lar memory cells (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
a programmable device the present invention relates to a programmable device and more particularly a programmable device for being programmed in the field by its user but which is capable of being tested during manufacture. the programmable devices to which the present invention relates include, for example, a rom (read only memory), a prom (programmable read only memory) and a fpla (field programmable logic array). such devices usually include a memory cell array with a number of peripheral circuits to address, program and read-out the memory cell array. in the existing systems for testing programmable devices, only tests for a limited number of types of faults in the peripheral circuits are possible. it is impossible to carry out a wide range of tests covering various types of faults in the peripheral circuits which makes it difficult to carry out reliable testing of the programmable devices before they have been programmed. according to this invention, a programmable device having a memory cell array including regular bit lines, regular word lines, regular memory cells connected at the crossing points of the regular bit lines and the regular word lines and test bit or test word lines adjacent to a group of the regular bit or regular word lines and connected to test memory cells is characterised in that non-conducting test memory cells are connected at the crossing points of the regular bit or regular word lines selected by the address signal "o" and one of the test bit or test word lines, and conducting test memory cells are connected at the crossing points of the regular bit or regular word lines selected by the address signal 'all" and one of the test bit or test word lines. particular examples of programmable devices in accordance with this invention will now be described and contrasted with the prior art with reference to the accompanying drawings; in which: figure 1 is a block diagram of a conventional programmable device; figure 2 is a circuit diagram of the arrangement of the memory cells in the memory cell array of a conventional programmable device; figure 3 is a circuit diagram of the address inverter corresponding to an address signal used in a conventional programmable device; figure 4 is a circuit diagram of an example of the connection of test memory cells to a test bit line; figure 5 is a circuit diagram of the connection of test memory cells to a test bit line for a single address signal input in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; ; figure 6 is a circuit diagram of the connection of test memory cells to a test bit line for two address signal inputs in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; figure 7 illustrates the arrangement of test memory cells to be connected to a test bit line for four address signal inputs in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; figure 8 is a circuit diagram illustrating an arrangement of test memory cells connected
