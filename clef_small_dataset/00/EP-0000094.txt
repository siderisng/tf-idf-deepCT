<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns an improved radial flow solids-fluid  contacting apparatus (1) in which radial flow of fluid  (liquid or gas) coacts with downward flow of the solids in  particle form.  the invention concerns the design and placement  of particle collection scoops (8) close to the bottom of  the bed (4) of particles to eliminate stagnant particle zones by  improving the conditions under which particles are withdrawn  from the bed.  the invention has particular application to a catalytic  reactor and an array of arcuate funnel-shaped scoops surrounding  the central pipe of such a reactor is preferred.  preferred  shapes and angles of inclination to the horizontal for  the scoops are disclosed.
