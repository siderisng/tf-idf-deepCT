<ABSTRACT>
there is provided a process for recovering a gas from a  feed gas mixture subject to wide variation in flow rate of at  least 1. 8 times the minimum positive flow rate comprising  contacting the feed gas mixture with a membrane selectively  permeable to said gas at a membrane number, as defined, of  at least 0. 5 and at a partial pressure differential for said gas  sufficient to provide a driving force for permeation of said  gas and recovering from said membrane a permeated gas  mixture more concentrated in said gas and having a  percentage variation in flow rate of no more than about 0. 6 of  the percentage variation in flow rate of the feed gas mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
gas recovery prd szckground of the invention this invention relates to a process for the separation and recovery of gases frcm mixtures of gases, and particularly relates to such a separation and recovery process from gas mixtures subject widely varying flow rates. a variety of processes and means have been developed and employed for the separation and recovery of one or more gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide; hydrogen sulfide and..hydrogen from mixtures thereof with one or more others of those gases or other gases such as the alkanes, methane, ethane and the like. many gas mixture streams from which -recovery is desired are subject to wide variations in flow rate. these variations are frequently due to the type of control and operation of the processes from which the gas mixtures are derived. for instance, processes involving hydrogen-containing gas mixtures are among the most common. in hydrogen using processes, such as hydrogenations, there is frequently derived a purge or vent gas containing a relatively high content of unreacted hydrogen. this high hydrogen content is usually due to the requirement for a high partial pressure of hydrogen for efficient hydrogenation. economical recovery and recycle of this purged hydrogen is parti cularly attractive. such recovery is made difficult, however, by the variations in flow rate of the purge gas. this can be induced by control features directed toward optimizing the reaction to produce the hydrogenated product, such as maintaining a minimum hydrogen pressure or a minimum hydrogen content in the hydrogenation reaction zone. such control features often result ir short term rapid increases or severe clnrtail- ments or total termination of purge, gas flow. sometimes such curtailti-ents are accompanied by changes in pressure of the purge gas varying by as much as 10 to 157, from the usual pressure. the more usual result is severe drops or increases in the flow rate of the purge gas. this is frequently the case when the method of control utilized is to crease or dedrease the flow of the reactant being hydrogenated to the hydrogenation reaction zone causing the hydrogen pressure or hydrogen content to trigger such control feature. the lag time in changing the flows of reactants for such control purposes is frequently substantial and results in the wide variations. similarly, in hydrogen-generating processes, such as reforming of hydrocarbons to produce gas mixtures containing hydrogen, there 'are 'also many sources or variations in the flow rate. these may include changes in catalyst activity and more 'sudden up sets such as plugging or removal from service of part of the tubes of a tubular refining reactor and malfunctions in the carbon dioxide removal and/or methanation reaction system which are normally employed in such hydrogen-generating processes. i.en t√≥ such processes are employed in series, such as when 2 hydrogen-generating process supplies a hydrogenation process, the effects of any variations in the hydrogen flow rate are multiplied and cumulative in their effect on the purge gas from. the hydrogenation process to which tbe
