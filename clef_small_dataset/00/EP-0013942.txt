<ABSTRACT>
1.  a centrifugal pump for liquids mixed with solids and more specially for liquids mixed with fibrous substances, comprising, a pump impeller (1) bearinged in a pump housing (2) placed round it, a driving shaft (21), that is positively joined to the pump impeller (1) and is guided in said pump housing (2), said driving shaft (21) running through an end face of the pump housing (2), and sealing elements for sealing off the space inside said housing from the bearing means of the impeller, and to make it possible for the pump impeller to be dismounted a termination member (3) is fixed to, and may be taken off, the end face of the housing furthest from the drive shaft, and on the outer end of the member (3) is fixed to, and may be taken off, the end face of the housing furthest from the drive shaft, and on the outer end of the member (3) there is fixed take-up means (5) for a middle turnpin (6), pointing towards the pump housing, for bearing the pump impeller (1), characterized in that the high pressure side of the pump is at the end, nearest the driving shaft (21), of the turnpin (6), and the low pressure side is at the termination member (3), and the termination member (3) has the function of the liquid inlet and in that on the high pressure side the ring-like space (17) walled off by the inner face of the pump impeller (1) and by the turnpin (6) is fluid-tightly shut off from the pump housing (2) by way of a stopper (16) and the drive motor is placed higher up than the level (s) of the liquid.
