<ABSTRACT>
in a process for preparing particulate, porous, water-­ insoluble amorphous poly(alumino-silicate) having a si/al  gram-atomic ratio of about 1:1 to 10:1, a pore volume of  greater than 0. 5 ml/g, an average pore diameter of 50 to 200 å  and a surface area of 200 to 600 m²/g by mixing an aqueous  solution of an appropriate aluminate and an aqueous solution  of an appropriate silicate, allowing the aluminate and silicate  in the resultant mixture to polymerize to poly(alumino-­ silicate), freezing the mixture and thereafter isolating, wash­ ing, drying and recovering particulate poly(alumino-silicate)  therefrom, said process characterized in that:   (a) the amounts, respectively, of aluminate and silicate,  calculated as al₂o₃ and sio₂, are such that the total amount  thereof in the mixture is about 4 to 25 weight % of the mixture,  such that the si/al gram-atomic ratio in the mixture is about  1:1 to 10:1, and such that the amount, in the mixture, of at  least one water-soluble compound which is precipitable from  the mixture at -10 to -100°c and which is inert to the alumi­ nate, silicate and poly(alumino-silicate) is about 25 to 160  weight %, based on the combined weights of aluminate and  silicate, calculated as al₂o₃ and sio₂; and   (b) the mixture is cooled to about -10 to -100°c until it is  frozen, to separate substantially all of the chemically unbound  water as substantially pure ice and to precipitate water-­ soluble compound within the pores of the poly(alumino-­ silicate) particles being formed.
