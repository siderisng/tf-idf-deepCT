<ABSTRACT>
a process is provided for the opening of envelopes made  of cellulosic paper by the action of a chemical degradation  agent in the presence of radiant heat in which the radiant heat  is generated from a source maintained at a temperature high  enough to produce a substantial amount of radiation having a  wave length of 2 microns or less and by applying to the edges  to be opened a darkening material capable of absorbing a  substantial portion of the incident radiant energy.
