<ABSTRACT>
1.  a tight window for a sloping roof, including a frame (1) to be secured to said roof, a leaf (2) for carrying the glazing, and a mechanism whereby said leaf (2) is pivotally movable with respect to said frame (1) about a horizontal axis located in their central region, such pivotal motion causing passage of the window from a closed position to an opened position by causing the initially lower portion of said leaf (2) to move along an arc of a circle within the space lying above the upper plane of said frame (1), said mechanism including at least, on each side of the window, a horizontal pivot (5), a fish-plate (6) integral with said fram (1) and a fish-plate (7) integral with said leaf (2), said frame (1) comprising, in its upper half, a sealing portion (4) intended to be pressed downwardly by said leaf (2), and said leaf (2) comprising, in its lower half in said closed position, a sealing portion (3) intended to be pressed upwardly against said frame (1), said fish-plates (6, 7) keeping the axis of said pivot (5) in a constantly fixed position with respect both to said leaf (2) and to said frame (1), during the opening or closing movement of said window, said pivot (5) lying above the upper plane of said leaf (2) when the latter is closed, characterized in that the lower end (9) of said sealing portion (4) of said frame (1) projects beyond the plane which is perpendicular to the upper plane of said frame (1) and intersects said pivot (5), by passing above the latter, while the sealing portion (3) of said leaf (2) passes below said pivot (5) and has a spacing to the axis of said pivot (5) larger than that of the lower end (9) of said sealing portion (4) of the leaf (1), and in that the assembly formed by said frame (1) and the fish-plate (6) integral therewith has a notch opening towards the lower portion of the roof and so dimensioned as to constitute a recess housing the upper end of the sealing portion (3) of said leaf (2) when the window is in its closed position, while the assembly formed by said leaf (2) and the fish-plate (7) integral therewith has a notch which, when said leaf (2) is in the inverted position, opens towards the upper portion of the roof, and is so dimensioned as to constitute a recess for housing the lower end (9) of said sealing portion (4) of the frame (1).
