<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for suppressing interfering signals in a useful signal, wherein the noise signals can be used as a mixture of narrow noise pulse tips (P) high amplitude and sturgeon (UN). It is desirable that without mutual influence such disturbing peaks and noise in a useful signal (U1) are suppressed. According to the invention, a resulting useful signal with possibly superimposed interference signals (UN and / or P) is supplied to a fault filter (B1). The fused fault brumm component is superimposed against the original signal for compensating the fault bracket in opposite directions. This only applies as long as noise pulse tips (P) are not recognized by a recognition device (B2). If such is detected, the filter is switched off from the input signal and switched to self-oscillation operation. As a result, an artificial vibration is generated with amplitude and frequency of the previously selected noise component without phase jump and superimposed on the useful signal. The stupid pulse tip is removed at the same time. The invention is specially use in the electrocardiogram processing for suppressing pacemaker pulses and mashing.
