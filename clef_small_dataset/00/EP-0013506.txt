<ABSTRACT>
in the production of solid films (e. g.  a floor covering wear  layer) from vinyl chloride polymer plastisols, good physical  properties of the plastisols and films are provided by use of a  plasticizer containing 50-90% of prime ester, at least about 40  parts per hundred parts by weight of which is aromatic diester  selected from alkyl benzyl succinates, glutarates and mixtures  thereof, 10-50% non-aromatic diester having a molecular  weight of 230-320, and optionally up to 20% hydrocarbon  boiling at 200-325Â°c.  using such a plasticizer, the plastisols  and films can be plasticized with relatively small amounts of  prime ester, and the films containing such small amounts of  prime ester have unusually high stain resistance.
