<ABSTRACT>
1.  an elevated flooring system comprising cantilevered composite slabs (1) supported in punctiform by stays (5), said slabs consisting of a deep-drawn, distortion-free and true to size, tub-shaped frame (11) of steel, into which is introduced an easy-to-pour respectively able to-flow hardening filling material (12), and into which are engaging fastening members projecting form the stays (5) through openings in the corner areas of the bottom part of the frame, characterized in that in the stays (5) and the composite slabs (1) sleeves (4, 8) are arranged in alignment with one another, at least one of said sleeves being provided with an internal thread, said sleeves receiving a threaded rod (3) adjustable up and down, on said rod the composite slab (1) being located and the sleeve (8) of the composite slab (1) substantially penetrating said slab and being embedded in the filling material (12) such that the threaded rod (3) is accessible and adjustable from the top, and that the stays (5) for receiving the corner areas of several composite slabs (1) are developed in one corner junction, in said corner junction on the stay (5) coinciding corner areas of the composite slabs (1) are respectively covering one sector surface of an upper supporting surface of the stay (5) and in each sector surface a sleeve being provided for the transverse reception of the threaded rod (3) of the corresponding corner area of the composite slab (1).
