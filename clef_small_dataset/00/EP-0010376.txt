<ABSTRACT>
method of dental plaque removal, device for carrying out  the method and method of making that device.  to make the tooth cleaning device, a filament loop of  contractable material such as polypropylene is caused to  shrink as it is being attached to a base.  the loop exhibits an  extraordinary contraction wherein the loop is not merely  reduced as expected, but by the disclosed process it contracts  into tightly adjacent filaments with a tight return loop (14).  the  resulting bristle not only solves the vexing problem of proper  bristle polishing, but additionally exhibits a greatly improved  capability to actually scoop away tooth deposits such as  plaque.  the tooth cleaning device is formed of a multiplicity of  such looped filaments.  the method of removing dental plaÂ­ que involves stroking the surface of the tooth with a plurality  of such looped filaments so that they act as scoops to carry  away plaque material trapped in the return bends.

<DESCRIPTION>
methods of cleaning teeth, tooth cleaning devices and methods of making such devices this invention relates to methods of cleaning teeth, tooth cleaning devices and methods of making such devices. as a prelude to the full understanding of the problem area of dental health to which the present invention is directed, it is recommended that united states patent 3 905 113 be read and understood. this prior teaching presents a novel approach to dental care by enabling the user to maintain a tactile sense and thus feel more accurately where he is in the masticatory region. the prior art has been directed toward the provision of bristles which scrub the plaque as they sweep away trapped food particles. the better brushes are processed to reduce fragmented end structures which lacerate tender gingivae. this invention builds on the teaching of united states patent 3 905 113. one purpose of the invention is to provide a novel bristle formation that fully eliminates fractured bristle ends and provides improved cleaning action to remove dental plaque. the invention is based on the discovery that a superior double bristle with a tight loop end can not only solve the problem of bristle ends but also provide a scooping action to cut free and carry away the tenacious plaque formation. the invention in one aspect provides a method of dental plaque removal, comprising the step of stroking the surface of a tooth with a plurality of double strand bristles each terminating in a tight return bend which serves as a scoop to scarf the surface of teeth and carry away plaque material trapped in the return bend. in a further aspect the invention provides a cleaning device by carrying out this method having a base and a plurality of bristles, each of which is composed of two lengths of filament held in a single composite configuration by a tight return bend, whereby the bristle acts as a drag scoop as opposed to a scratch brush of conventional construction. also the invention provides a method for making the cleaning device referred to, the method comprising the steps of: (1) providing a filament of shrinkable material characterised by its ability to contract to a resilient reed configuration under an externally applied agent, (2) providing lengths of said filament and looping each length of filament to place the ends in a base region, and (3) applying said agent to cause each filament to shrink into a bristle in the form of a loop. the invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which: figure 1 is a plan view of one preferred embodiment of a tooth cleaning device according to the invention; figure 2-illustrates a fabric ground base and loops of heat shrinkable filaments as they appear when merely woven; figure 3 illustrates the use of forming bars in the weaving process and the application of heat to cause the filaments to contract to the bars; and figure 4 is a greatly enlarged section showing

claims   1. the method of dental plaque removal, comprising the step of stroking the surface of a tooth with a plurality of double strand bristles each terminating in a tight return bend which serves as a scoop to scarf the surface of teeth and carry away plaque material trapped in the return bend.   2. a tooth cleaning device having a base and a plurality of bristles, each of which is composed of two lengths of filament held in a single composite configuration by a tight return bend, whereby the bristle acts as a drag scoop as opposed to a scratch brush of conventional construction.   3. the method of making an improved tooth cleaning device, comprising the steps of:  (1) providing a filament of a shrinkable  material characterised by its ability to  contract to a resilient reed configuration  under an externally applied agent,  (2) providing lengths of said filament and  looping each length of filament to place the  ends in a base region, and  - (3) applying said agent to cause each filament  to shrink into a bristle in the form of a loop.    4. the method of claim 3, wherein the shrinkable material is polypropylene and the agent is heat.        the    method of making an improved tooth cleaning device, comprising the steps of:  (1) providing a filament of polypropylene,  (2) looming said filament tightly over a  thin forming rail, with a return bend over  the top of the rail and a length of the  filament along the sides of the rail,  (3) applying heat to shrink the return bend  of the filament into a tight clamp which holds  the side length together as a composite  bristle and itself serving as a scoop to  scarf away dental plaque.
