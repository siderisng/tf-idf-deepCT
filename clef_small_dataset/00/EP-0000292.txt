<ABSTRACT>
chloro-s-triazine triones are used as a source of chlorine  in cleansing and bleaching compositions.  the usual method  for the production of chloro-s-triazine triones comprises  reacting cyanuric acid, an alkali metal hydroxide and chlorine  in an aqueous reaction mixture from which the chloro-s-triazine  trione crystallizes forming a slurry which is then filtered.   the filtration characteristics of the slurry and the storage  stability of the product are both affected by the form in  which the chloro-s-triazine trione crystallizes from the aqueous  reaction mixture, and improvements on prior art procedures  are desirable.  according to the present invention the  reaction is carried out in the presence of a crystal modifier  which is a disulfonic acid of an alkylated diphenyloxide  wherein the alkyl group contains from 8 to 14 carbon atoms  or a corresponding alkali metal disulfonate.  a product having  enhanced crystal properties and improved storage stability is  obtained.
