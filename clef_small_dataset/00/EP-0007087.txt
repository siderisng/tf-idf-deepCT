<ABSTRACT>
a programmable control for load management of a plur­ ality of electrical power loads (f) is disclosed which contains  at least two groups (f1, f2) of load controllers for controlling  the power supply to loads connected to various preselected  load controllers.  a group selector (10) selects which of the  groups is functionally operative at any given instant in time  based on environment or other criteria.  a serial selector (20)  commonly connected to each of the load controllers in the  groups serially selects one of the load controllers in each  group for conduction for at least one period of the serial  selector.  there is provided a first set of programming points  (d) situated at the input to the load controllers.  the program­ ming points are selectively connected by wires or diodes in  any desired fashion to modify the conduction period or order  of the various load controllers.  a restart delay (30) mechanism  is included, which is operative in the event of power failure, to  delay the conduction on any of the load controllers for a  period of time upon restoration of power.
