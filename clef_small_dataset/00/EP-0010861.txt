<ABSTRACT>
when explosive fuels such as hydrocarbons are pump­ ed into or out of a barge or tanker (1), a metallic conduit  (2) having an insulated flange (f-1) therein is typically  connected to the barge.  the system (10) of this invention  involves connecting the barge to the earth (e) through a  barge-grounding cable (3), connecting the metallic conduit  to the earth through a conduit-grounding cable (4), where­ by a grounding test circuit (7) is established with a current  source (40) connected between the earth and the ground­ ing cables.  a flange resistor (35) is connected across the  insulated flange to form a flange circuit (8).  the currents  (i₁ and i₂) flowing through the grounding cables are being  continuously monitored in the grounding circuit to deter­ mine the presence of a broken cable or of an ineffective  electric contact.  a continuity test is also being made of  the flange insulation in the flange circuit.  a plurality of  sensing relays (21-26) are operatively coupled to the  grounding test circuit and to the flange circuit for sensing  the currents flowing in the grounding test circuit and in the  flange circuit.  the sensing relays are operatively intercon­ nected through suitable switching means with an alarm  circuit (10′) having warning devices (13-18) which indi­ cate safe and dangerous operating conditions.
