<ABSTRACT>
a combined bellcrank lever and plunger moulded integrally  in plastics material has one arm (2) which engages a  setting cam and another arm (3) connected to a displaceable  member such as a switch operating plunger (4) through an  integral ligament hinge (5).  also formed integrally with the  lever and plunger is a shaft (1) by means of which the device is  pivotally engaged in a support (10) by snap engagement.  the ligament hinge (5) may have self-resilience enabling  it to exert a biassing moment on the lever or the plunger when  the device is installed.
