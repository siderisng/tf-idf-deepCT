<ABSTRACT>
a process for the preparation of compounds of general  formula    (wherein r³ represents an optionally substituted c₁₋₁₂  aliphatic chain) which comprises deprotecting the group  or of a compound of formula    (where r¹ represents an optionally substituted c₁₋₁₂ aliphatic  chain and r represents a hydroxyl protecting group),  which process enables intermediates in the preparation  of prostaglandins to be interconverted.

<DESCRIPTION>
process-for the interconversion of intermediates of use in the preparation of prostaglandins this invention relates to a process of interconverting certain intermediates useful in the preparation of prostaglandins. the prostaglandins are a class of naturally occurring cyclopentane derivatives whose importance in medicine is rapidly increasing. they are biologically active in many physiological systems and they or substances which antagonise their effects have potential application, for example, in the control of fertility, gastric secretion, blood pressure, blood coagulation and inflammation, the predominant type of activity depending on the precise chemical structure. a more detailed summary of their various activities is given in british patent specification no.1,396,206. considerable research has been carried out not only into the synthesis of natural prostaglandins but also into attempting to prepare analogues thereof having desirable a-gonist or antagonist activity. in view of the complex stereochemistry of the prostaglandin molecule, such syntheses as have been developed tend to be complicated, involving a large number of steps, and means whereby the complexity of such syntheses may be reduced have considerable value. in particular, methods are required which while applicable to the manufacture of natural prostaglandins, are also applicable to the preparation of analogues and which provide flexibility in the types of prostaglandin ring structures which may be prepared. inour belgian patent no. 848992 we describe s-lactones of the formula (i), emi2.1 (where r represents an optionally substituted c1 12 aliphatic chain and r represents a hydroxyl protecting group) as intermediates useful in the synthesis, inter alia, of natural prostaglandins. reduction to the corresponding lactol (hemiacetal) permits introduction 2 of a second aliphatic chain r to yield a product of formula (ii), emi2.2 (wherein r and r1 have the above meanings). it will be appreciated that the terms a-, d-, eand f-series as used herein refer to the substitution pattern of the cyclopentanoid ring that is characteristic of the natural prostaglandins in their defined series, without regard to the identity of the chains r1 and r . the compound of formula (ii) is thus a 9-protected prostaglandin of the f-series. oxidation of the compound of formula (ii) yields a corresponding compound of the d-series i.e. of the formula (iia), emi3.1 it is, however, tedious to convert a compound of formula (ii) into a prostaglandin of the e-series, i.e. a compound of the formula (iib), emi3.2 since this requires reversal of the protectea and unprotected hydroxyl groups in the f-series compound of formula (ii). since the prostaglandins of the a- and e-series are of particular interest in medicine, it would be especially desirable if the intermediate of formula ) could readily be converted into a compound of the eseries which in turn can afford a compound of the a-series. we have now found that when the protected hydroxy group or of the g-iactone of formula (i) is deprotected there is spontaneous rearrangement to the corresponding y-lactone of formula (iii), emi4.1 3 (where r is an optionally substituted c1 12 aliphatic chain). where r carries a protected hydroxyl group, this may
