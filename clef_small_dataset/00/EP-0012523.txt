<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to new compositions of poorly  soluble or water insoluble drugs and to compositions of  relatively soluble drugs which have a tendency to agglo­ merate or crystallise in storage or after formulation into  pharmaceutical dosage form.  the new compositions provide  higher dissolution rates of said drugs in vitro and incre­ ased bioavailability.  the compositions of this invention  comprise such poorly soluble, water insoluble or relatively  soluble drugs, a non-toxic water soluble poiymer and a  wetting agent.  a process for preparing the compositions is  also disclosed.  compositions containing the known anti-­ fungal griseofulvin illustrate the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to compositions of poorly soluble or water insoluble drugs which provide poor bioavailability or are irregularly absorbed following oral administration of their solid dosage forms and to compositions of relatively soluble drugs which have a tendency to agglomerate or crystallise in storage or after formulation into pharmaceutical dosage form. more specifically, the herein disclosed invention relates to new pharmaceutical compositions of matter comprising such poorly soluble, water insoluble or relatively soluble drugs, a non-toxic water soluble polymer and a wetting agent. the invention further relates to a process for preparing the disclosed compositions which compositions provide a high order of drug bioavailability. in the main, the invention will be illustrated with the known antifungal griseofulvin. many drugs give an incomplete and irregular absorption when taken orally, particularly poorly water soluble or water insoluble compounds such as griseofulvin and many steroids. one of the earlier attempts to enhance the availability or bioavailability of such drugs relied on mechanical micronization of the pure compounds in order to decrease their particle size. while micronization did enhance absorption over the use of unmicronized material, absorption of the drug was still incomplete. further the degree of micronization which can be achieved is limited and the micronized particles tend to agglomerate, thus diminishing both the solubility of the drug and its bioavailability. u.s. patent 2,900,304 is an illustration of griseofulvin compositions for oral or parenteral administration employing micronized drug particles. another approach for attempting to enhance the bioavailability of griseofulvin was studied by marvel et al and teported in the ol of investigative dermatology, 42, 197-203 (1964). their studies related to the effect of a surfactant and particle size on the bioavailability of griseofulvin when orally administered. results of their studies indicated that bioavailability of the drug was enhanced when administered in very dilute solutions or aqueous suspensions. their results further tended to confirm that enhanced bioavailability was obtained with griseofulvin having a higher specific surface area, at least when administered in full daily divided doses. with respect to the effect of the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate incorporated into griseofulvin tablets, their results demonstrated some initial enhancement of bioavailability with regularly particle sized drug and very little enhancement with micronized drug in comparison to surfactant-free tablets. these investigators further reported that when the daily dose was divided, the surfactant had no enhancing effect. still another approach for the enhancement of drug bioavailability is represented by the work of tachibana and nakamura in kollid-zeitschrift and zeitschrift fur polymere, 203, pgs. 130-133 (1965) and mayershohn et al in the journal of pharmaceutical science, 55, pgs. 1323-4 (1966). both publications deal with the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) for forming dispersions of a drug. tachibana discusses the role of pvp in forming very dilute colloidal dispersions of 8-carotene in pvp. mayersohn further prepared solid dispersions or solid solutions of griseofulvin in pvp and the reported results show dissolution rates for the drug increasing with increasing proportions of pvp. this last publication further reported that in the absence
