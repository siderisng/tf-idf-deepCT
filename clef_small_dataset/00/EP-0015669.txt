<ABSTRACT>
poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid), phb, is produced by the  aerobic culture of methylobacterium organophilum strains  ncib 11482 to 11488 inclusive on a carbon source such as  methanol.  accumulation of phb is favoured by culturing in  two stages; the first stage is conducted in the presence of  an adequate supply of nitrogen and phosphorus and the  second stage is conducted under nitrogen and/or phosÂ­ phorus starvation conditions.  pure cultures of the micro-organism strains are also  claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
microbiological process for the production of polv(3-hydroxybutyric acid) and micro-organisms for use therein this invention relates to a microbiological process for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid), hereinafter referred to as phb, and to micro-organisms for use in such a process. it has been known since the 1920's that many bacteria are capable of accumulating ph:b granules within their cells as an energy reserve material. some of the bacteria, mainly naturally occurring, so capable are surveyed by senior et al. in advances in microbial physiology 1973, 10, 203 - 266. in that survey, it is reported that certain bacteria, notably azotobacter bei.lerinckii and hydrogenomonas eutropha could, under certain conditions, accumulate relatively high proportions of peb. however such bacteria do not metabolise methanol which is a relatively cheap source of carbon. it is known that certain bacteria that are capable of metabolising methanol, do, under certain conditions, metabolise methanol to phb. thus in our british patent specification 1370892 it is disclosed that certain strains of wnhomicrobium variabile and pseudomonas rosea accumulate es when grown on a methanol substrate. furthermore it is disclosed by o'connor et al. in j. general microbiologr 1977, 98, 265 - 272 that a mutant of metkylobacterium organophilum accumulates phb when metabolising methanol but will only grow in the presence of glutamate. pseudomonas alvfl is also known to metabolise methanol to phb. none of these known methanol-metabolising bacteria give sufficiently high yields of phb of high molecular weight to render their use in the manufacture of p a commercial proposition. while pseudomonas am1 may, under favourable conditions give fb contents of the order of 25% by weight or more, the molecular weight of the peb so produced is relatively low. we have now found certain strains of methglobacterium organophilum that will metabolise methanol to give relatively high proportions of high molecular weight phb. accordingly we provide a method of producing phb comprising aerobically culturing a purified metbylobacterium organophilum micro-organism strain selected from strains designated by ncib nos. 11482 to 11488 inclusive and mutants and variants of such strains. the ncn3 nos. are the numbers designated to specimen cultures of the strains deposited on 9 january 1979 with the national collection of industrial 3acteria, tory research station, aberdeen, scotland. specimen cultures have also been deposited on at the central 3ureau voor schimmelcultures, baarn, netherlands and have been designated by the following c3s numbers ncib no cbs no 11482 11483 11484 11485 11486 11487 11488 further in accordance with the invention, we provide a pure culture of a nethvlobacterium organophilum strain selected from strains designated by ncib nos. 11482 to 11488 inclusive and mutants and variants of such strains. description of the novel strains 1. general the novel strains are very similar to one another and are short gram negative motile rods of approximate size 2 11m x 0.5 pm, with some variation in thickness. occasionally branched rods may be observed. under certain conditions they contain granules of poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid). they do not form spores. when grown aerobically on methanol agar
