<ABSTRACT>
1.  a control valve for an indirectly acting compressed air-brake comprising : a quick service intensifier valve (39) which, on braking, can be opened by a main control piston (80) via a lever (37) which is rockable by an unlocking device (40), said unlocking device (40) having two pistons (41, 42), a first chamber (52) between said two pistons (41, 42) is connected to the brake cylinder (15) and one piston (41) is loaded by a first spring (45) and a second chamber (54) on the other side of said piston (41) is connected to the atmosphere, characterised in that the two unlocking pistons (41, 42) consist of a large piston (42) and a small piston (41) and the large piston (42) is loaded in the unlocking direction by a spring (46) and third chamber (53) opposite to said first chamber (52) on the other side of said large piston (42) is connected by a throttle (55) with said first chamber (52).
