<ABSTRACT>
in this device, the wire to be braked or tensioned is grasped by the device.  so that the device can be employed for virtually any wire diameter, it has at least one flexible braking band (13) which is arranged essentially parallel to the wire (10) and whose ends are fastened in holders (3, 5) of the device, of which at least one (5) is arranged displaceably in the longitudinal direction of the wire (10) and rotatably about the latter.  as a function of the desired tensioning or braking of the wire, the braking band is more or less often wound around the wire and more or less tautened.  <image>
