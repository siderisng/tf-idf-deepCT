<ABSTRACT>
a scale especially useful in automated mailing includes a  directly loaded weight-to-period transducer which provides  an oscillatory output the period of which varies as a function  of the weight to be measured.  the transducer includes a disc  "40,44" of piezoelectrically active material bonded to an inac足 tive substrate base "42" which dishes at its center in response  to the weight to be measured.  the transducer frequency out足 put is processed to provide a digital period signal.  a reference  oscillator having matched temperature characteristics gener足 ates a high frequency count calibrated for scaling the trans足 ducer period to a weight count.  the high frequency signal and  the period signal are gated to provide an input to a counter  which generates a digital weight information signal.  the  weight information signal may be transmitted to a postage  mailing system processor for use in determining the postage  requisite for mailing the article.
