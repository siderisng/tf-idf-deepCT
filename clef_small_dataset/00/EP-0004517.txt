<ABSTRACT>
1.  wall shelves made up of at least two ropes (11) and some shelves (12) one above the other, supported by the free ends (22) of the ropes (12) by means of lugs (18), characterized by the fact that the two free ends (22) are held in place by a rigid tubular right-angle bracket (10) for each rope (11), comprising a horizontal arm and another arm which is vertical and can be fixed to a wall ; by the fact that the right-angle bracket (10) has openings comprising mechanical sections at both ends (13-14 and 16-17) and at the elbow (15) ; by the fact that each rope (11) is housed inside the two arms of the right-angle bracket (10) and brings the two ends of the bracket (10) together to form a triangle ; by the fact that two strands of each rope (11) cross over in the horizontal arm of the right-angle bracket (10) and the two free ends (22) come out of the openings (15 and 17) at each end of the horizontal arm of the bracket ; and by the fact that the rope (11) is guided as it comes out of the bracket (10) by curved grooves in the mechanical sections of the openings.
