<ABSTRACT>
this device comprises a stirrup (i) bearing a bobbin (2),  and a holding organ (9) solidly attached to the rod (8a) of a  jack (8) and joined to a pivoting element (ii) driven by a jack  (12).  an arm (13) to discharge the bobbin bears an articulated  pipe (17) connected to a suction means (asp) and a device to  shear the yarn.  said device is fitted so that it can swivel  around an axis (14) and is driven by a jack (15).  said device  discharges the bobbin while passing between the arms of  the raised stirrup (i).  a transfer organ (24) driven by a jack  (25) serves to bring the empty tubes from the storage point  (7) to between the arms of the stirrup (i).  a hook (19) is  shifted around an axis (20) by a jack (22) so as to bend the  trajectory of the yarn and bring it near to an arm of the stirrup  (i) so as to create a reserve of yarn while the winding of a  new bobbin is being started.  this device can be employed for  the removal of bobbins on open-end spinning machines.
