<ABSTRACT>
a process for making anhydrous alcohol denatured with  gasoline for ready mixing with additional gasoline to make  gasohol and in which aqueous alcohol (24) is introduced into  a dehydration drying column (1) along with gasoline.  the  alcohol, containing gasoline, flows into the lower zone of the  drying column and is recovered as a substantially non-­ aqueous alcohol-gasoline mixture (4) which may be clas­ sified as completely denatured alcohol.  the rising vapors of  the gasoline entrain the water and some alcohol as azeo­ tropes which flow out the top of the column as vapors (6)  which are condensed to form a gasoline layer (9) which is  returned to the column and a water layer (15) which is  removed.  additional water is also removed by decantation  on the top several trays of the drying column where it is  present as a separate liquid phase.  the process also includes  utilizing the heat to strip the alcohol from dilute fermented  wort for the recovery and reconcentration of the alcohol in  the water layers recycled from the drying column while pre­ venting any gasoline from contaminating the fermented feed  product and insuring that gasoline is present as a contami­ nent in all alcoholic streams.  provision is also made to insure  that all light ends in the incoming gasoline are contained in  the alcohol-gasoline product.
