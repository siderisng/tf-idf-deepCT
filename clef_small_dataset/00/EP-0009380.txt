<ABSTRACT>
a cation exchange water softener (30) may be regen­ erated and, then, the regenerant wastes (brine) are recov­ ered, treated, and recycled.  the result is a closed system  which is ecologically beneficial.  the regenerant brine is  captured in as concentrated a form as possible and then  treated with a precipitant such as sodium or potassium  carbonate or mixtures of sodium or potassium carbonate  with sodium or potassium hydroxide.  calcium and magne­ sium compounds are precipitated and the supernatant con­ tains sodium or potassium chloride.  these are separated  within a brine treatment tank (26), the precipitate being  disposed of as a slude or sludge cake and the supernatant  being recycled to the water softener (30) at the time of fur­ ther regeneration.
