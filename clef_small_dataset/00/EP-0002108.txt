<ABSTRACT>
a coloured acrylic sheet having an attractive 3-dimensional  depth of colour resulting from the use of a mixture  of pigments or a pigment and a dye wherein an inorganic  pigment, distributed non-uniformly throughout the  sheet and a colourant is distributed uniformly through  the sheet, the particles of non-uniformly distributed pigment  being concentrated preferentially towards one surface  of the sheet and are visible through the opposite surface  of the sheet which is preferably substantially free  from the non-uniformly distributed pigment.  the attractive  appearance is further enhanced by shaping the sheet and  the sheet is particularly suitable for forming articles of  sanitaryware.
