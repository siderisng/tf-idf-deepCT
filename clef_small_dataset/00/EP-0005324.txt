<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a delayed action electrical  protection device which may be used for example to protect  electrical lines and equipment against disturbances  such as overload conditions and minimum voltage conditions.   an analogue signal denoting the particular condition  for which protection is to be provided is converted  into a digital signal which is applied to a micro-processor.   in the micro-processor this digital is compared with a  prescribed value or values fed into the processor.  the processor  contains information relating to characteristic  curves which define the time delay between the detection  of a particular condition and the production of a tripping  signal which may, for example, be used to interrupt the  electrical circuit and/or provide an alarm.  the time delay  varies inversely with the magnitude of any disturbance and  may, for example, be defined by the expression:-      where k is a constant; i equals  i / i; where i is the measured  current and in is the prescribed value.
