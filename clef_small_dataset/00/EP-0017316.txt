<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for treating the surface of a cylindrical object (e. g.  an exposed photopolymer printing sleeve) in a number of sequential steps.  a plurality of cylinders are supported in an enclosure one each on a plurality of carriers (8 to 11) rotated by a transmission from a motor (48).  each cylinder is rotatable past a hot air drying inlet unit (55, 56), an ultraviolet exposure unit (53) and a unit (58,59) for spraying a detackifying solution.  the units are operational in required sequence for simultaneously and equally treating the surface of each cylindrical object.

<DESCRIPTION>
"processing the surface of cylindrical objects" this invention relates to apparatus for treating the surfaces of cylindrical objects in a number of sequential steps. there are many fields wherein it is necessary to treat the outer surface of a cylinder by a succession of processes, and many methods of handling the cylinder during that treatment have been used. the objective of the present invention is to provide a compact apparatus which can be used for processing cylinders and which is designed to ensure that the whole surface of the cylinder can be equally treated in each process step. according to the present invention, apparatus for treating the surface of a cylindrical object in a number of sequential steps comprises an enclosure, mounting means in the enclosure for releasably engaging opposite ends of a cylindrical object to support said object within the enclosure, drive means for rotating said mounting means to rotate said object about its axis, a plurality of treatment means directed towards the location of said object when mounted, and means controlling operation of the treatment means in a desired sequence as said object is rotated. the mounting of the object in an enclosure within which all necessary process steps are effected removes the need for transferring the cylinder from one processing location to another. preferably the apparatus is designed to be used with the object mounted so that its axis is vertical and each treatment means is designed to apply treatment simultaneously over the full axial length of the object. this optimises uniform treatment of the full surface of the object. preferably a plurality of mounting means are provided in a common enclosure so that a number of objects may be simultaneously treated. clearly the number and distribution of the treatment means is then arranged so that the surfaces of all the objects are treated equally and simultaneously. this arrangement is particularly suitable when the object has to be treated by process steps which differ in duration as it allows a number of objects to be simultaneously processed in the minimum necessary time. where a plurality of mounting means are provided they are conveniently driven from a common drive. the apparatus is particularly suitable for use in the finishing of photopolymer printing cylinders. such cylinders have been exposed through a negative to ultra-violet light and the areas so exposed have hardened due to that exposure, leaving soft unexposed areas between the hardened areas. after this exposure the soft material is then brushed out from the surface of the cylinder by means of a solvent applied in a brushing unit, so giving a cylinder with a relief printing surface. the cylinder must then be dried to remove the solvent, postexposed to expose the whole surface of the cylinder to ultra-violet radiation, detackified by a suitable liquid agent and then finally dired. these four finishing steps may all be carried out in the enclosure of apparatus according to the invention. thus, from another aspect the invention resides in apparatus for
