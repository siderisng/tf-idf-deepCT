<ABSTRACT>
material containing iron in combination with chromium,  such as chromite ore or sand, may be upgraded by removing  at least some iron by a fluidised bed process in which iron is  chlorinated to ferrous chloride in the presence of carbon and  the ferrous chloride vapour removed.  selectivity of the pro­ cess in reducing or avoiding the chlorination of the chromium  content of the ore and in reducing or avoiding the formation of  ferric chloride, with resulting increased chlorine usage effi­ ciency, may be achieved by control of process parameters  such as bed depth, chlorine concentration, and temperature.   the invention may be used to produce a suitable raw material  for the production of ferrochrome, which generally requires a  chromium to iron ratio of at least 3:1, from an initial material  in which the said ratio is below 2:1, either by upgrading the  bulk of the material to the desired level or a portion to above  the required level and blending the product with untreated  material.
