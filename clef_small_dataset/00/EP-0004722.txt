<ABSTRACT>
a process for the manufacture of multi-layered thermoplastic  containers (13) which have integral multilayer bottom  (15) and side walls (14), the top of the side walls being  circumferentially provided with a single layer flange (18)  adapted to be interfolded with metal closures (19) for  sealing.  in order to simplify the manufacture of the containers  and thereby to reduce the cost of the containers, they are  made by preparing a multilayer billet (10) having a first and  second thermoplastic layer (12, 11), the layers being so  adapted that when the thermoplastic material of the layers is  heated to the heat softened state and a compressive force is  imposed thereon, the first layer (12) is extruded at a faster  flow rate than the second layer (11);   heating the billet (10) to place the layers (12, 11) in the  heat softened state;   compressing the billet (10) to cause the extrusion of the  heat softened layers (12, 11) into a mold cavity whereby the  fastest moving layer (12) forms the flange (18) and exterior  surface portions (16) of the container (13) and the slower of  the layers (11) forms the interior surface portion (17) of the  container (13).
