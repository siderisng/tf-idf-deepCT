<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a guanidine derivative of the  formula:    in which x is o or s; y is n or ch; n is 1 to 4; m ist o or  1; r¹ is h, c(1-6)alkyl or c(3-10)alkoxyalkyl; -r² is -a-b in  which a is 3,4-dioxocyclobuten-1,2-diyl or c = z in which z  is o, s, ncn, nno₂, chno₂, nconh₂, c(cn)₂, ncor³,  nco₂r³, nso₂r³ or nr⁴ in which r³ is c(1-6)alkyl, phenyl or  a monocyclic heteroaromatic ring containing 1 or 2 hetero­ atoms selected from o, n and s and r⁴ is h or c(1-6)alkyl;  b is c(1-6)alkyl, alkoxy or alkylthio or nhr⁵ in which r⁵ is h  or c(1-6)alkyl, c(3-10)alkenyl or alkynyl, c(3-6)cycloalkyl,  c(2-6)(primary hydroxy)alkyl or (primary amino)alkyl,  c(1-6)haloalkyl, c(3-6)alkoxyalkyl, phenylalkyl or monocyclic  aromatic heterocyclylakyl in which the alkyl part is c(1-6),  the phenyl carries an optional halogen and the hetero­ cyclic ring contains 1 or 2 hetero atoms selected from o,  n and s, or r⁵ is benzoylaminoalkyl or benzenesulphonyl­ aminoalkyl in which alkyl part is c(2-6) and the benzene  ring carries an optional cl substituent, or a radical of the  formula:    in which x, y, n, m and r¹ are as above, p is 2 to 12 and  g is s or ch₂ or -r² is a radical of the formula:    and the salts thereof.
