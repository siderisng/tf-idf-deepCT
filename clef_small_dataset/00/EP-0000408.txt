<ABSTRACT>
process for transferring a powder image which has  been formed with permanently magnetizable developing  powder, which process comprises the steps of magnetically  transferring the powder image (2) to an intermediate receiving  member (4) having a uniform magnetic permeability  over its whole surface and comprising magnetizable  material having no remanent magnetism and subsequently  transferring the powder image from the intermediate receiving  material (9).  the transfer of the powder image (2) to  the intermediate receiving member (4) is effected by mag­ netizing the powder image (2) and contacting it with the  intermediate receiving member (4).  in a specific embodiment  of the invention, the powder image (2) is magnetized  while it is in contact with the surface of the intermediate  receiving member (4).  the intermediate receiving member  (4) preferably has a relative magnetic permeability of at  least 2.
