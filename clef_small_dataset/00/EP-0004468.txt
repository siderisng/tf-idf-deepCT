<ABSTRACT>
an absorber (14) for solar energy converters (11) is  provided with an internal chamber (2) through which a  heat exchange fluid may be passed so that as the absorber  (14) is neated by radiation focussed thereon by a reflector  (7) the heat may be extracted into the fluid.  to minimise  the volume of the chamber (2) and thus increase the efficiency  and sensitivity of the heat transfer, the absorber  (14) is formed with curved walls (3, 4) to define an internal  chamber (2) having a crescent-shaped cross-section.  the efficiency of the reflectors (7) is increased by employing  as the reflecting surface a thin layer of aluminium  (9) applied to a flexible supporting sheet (8).  the solar energy converter (11) is oriented into an  optimum position for receiving solar radiation by a control  system incorporating driving means (19) for orienting the  converter (11) controlled by a unidirectional photoelectric  cell (24) which is obscured from the sun's rays by a  masking member (25) in the optimum position.
