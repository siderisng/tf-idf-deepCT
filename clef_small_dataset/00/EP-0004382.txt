<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for continuously indicating the quality of a battery.  in the method, regularly recurring brief discharge current pulses are applied to the battery, the battery voltage value prevailing after the application of a discharge current pulse is determined by measurement and stored until the arrival of the next discharge current pulse and the difference between the battery voltage value and a predetermined minimum voltage value is continuously indicated as a measure of the quality of the battery.  the apparatus comprises means for applying regularly recurring discharge current pulses to a battery, means for determining the battery voltage value prevailing after the application of a discharge current pulse, a storage device for storing the particular battery voltage value determined until the arrival of the next discharge current pulse and an indicating unit by which the difference between the battery voltage value and a predetermined minimum voltage value is continuously indicated as a measure of the quality of the battery.
