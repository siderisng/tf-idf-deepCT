<ABSTRACT>
The invention includes a method, in particular for reproduction of oil paintings, wherein one exits from one externally to the Öberflänfe structure the original corresponding to the lectrically heated color image film. This color image film (2) is arranged together with a reinforcing layer (9) on its back side, which is provided on its side of the color image film with a thin dielectrically heated coating, between two plate-shaped high-frequency electrodes (45), wherein the image Side of the color image film from a dielectrically non-heating reliefform (1) and the back of the reinforcing layer (9) are covered by a planar pressure compensation plate (7). The relief form (1) and the pressure equalization plate (7) consist of elastic, dielectrically non-heated material. By mechanical pressurization of the high-frequency zelectrodes, together with the high-frequency energy, the image side of the color image film receives the desired surface structure, while at the same time the reinforcing layer is welded to the back of the color image film. It results in a short welding time by which che the colors of the color image film are spared. Due to the tissue of the reinforcing layer, the impression of a real oil painting is largely imitated.
