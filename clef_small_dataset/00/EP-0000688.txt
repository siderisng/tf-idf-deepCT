<ABSTRACT>
1.  atomizing nozzle for dispensing a liquid, which is subject to an elevated pressure, in the form of a spray, comprising at least two parts (32; 33), which frontally adjoin each other radially to the axis (ma) of the outlet orifice (41) present in one of the parts, between the parts being arranged an axially symmetrical flowing path system (35; 36; 37; 38; 39), which centrically has an outlet chamber (45) with several ducts (36; 38) ending therein in the main tangentially from a surrounding annular chamber (37; 39), in the ducts (36) further ducts (35) ending essentially right-angled in the former from an outward and axial direction are provided, through which the pressurized liquid (139) is led from the exterior to the flowing path system, characterized in that there is provided a peg-like deviating projection (40) situated centrically in the outlet chamber (45) opposite to the outlet orifice (41) protruding near to the outlet orifice (41) and/or there is arranged in at least one of the tangential ducts (36) a deviating projection (23).
