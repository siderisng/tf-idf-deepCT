<ABSTRACT>
the figure shows an ink jet head 10 comprising a hous足 ing 12 having a cylindrical passage 20 containing a cylindri足 cal tube 19 formed of piezo-electric material.  a nozzle plate  49 is attached to the housing to register with a portion 46 of  the housing wall of reduced thickness.  apertures 47 through  the wall portion 46 register with nozzles 48 in the plate 49.   the tube 19 is subject to an electric field established between  an electrode formed internally of the tube and pressurized  conductive ink in the passage 20.  longitudinal vibrations in  the tube 19 are absorbed by resilient mountings 22, 23.  when  tube 19 is electrically excited pressure waves are set up in the  ink in passage 20 and the ink jets issuing from nozzles 48 are  caused to break-up into similar streams of ink drops.  in a modification the wall portion 46 is removed and the  aperture so formed oovered by a flexible sheet diaphragm  held against the housing by a manifold plate interposed bet足 ween the none plate and the housing.  the manifold plate  has an open-sided recess registering with the housing wall  aperture and communicating with the nozzles through an  array of outlets through the bottom of the recess.  in this  modification the passage 20 is filled with liquid and ink is  supplied under pressure to the manifold plate recess.  pres足 sure waves established in the passage 20 are transmitted  through the diaphragm in the ink in the manifold plate  recess.
