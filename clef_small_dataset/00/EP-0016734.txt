<ABSTRACT>
The method and apparatus for compressing the waste separator use a piston arrangement (17, 18) acting on a mass of waste in a receptacle formed of a cylindrical wall (5) and a background constituted by a counter -Piston (16). This counter-piston can come to engage so as to seal sludge exhaust orifices (24), for a first portion of the compression using the piston arrangement (17, 18). Then, this counter-piston (16) drops so as to release these orifices when a certain pressure is reached. The compression piston arrangement (17, 18) comprises two coaxial pistons which are arranged to constantly ensure a substantially uniform pressure in the waste mass. It is thus possible to extract virtually all liquid, pasty or fluent waste materials, to obtain sludge useful for agriculture. We also obtain virtually dry and very little waste bricks, the waste is not crushed but internment cixiled and contracted, which allows a good agglomerate. The bricks obtained are advantageously used as combustible heating briquettes.
