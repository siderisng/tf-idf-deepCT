<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-dependent electric current rule or limiting switching element, in particular for electrically heated devices, includes a temperature-sensitive switching device (5) with a automatically switchable con tact pair (4,6), over which the power supply of the device is normally controlled.Thus, in an error of the temperature-sensitive switching device (5) does not occur any damage in the device due to overheating, in series with the contact pair (4, 6) a thermal trigger (10), which with the switching device (5) to a uniform assemblyunited.The trigger limit temperature of the thermal trigger (10) is above the working temperature of the temperature sensitive switching device (5).
