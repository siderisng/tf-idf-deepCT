<ABSTRACT>
a method of applying microelectronic circuit elements,  such as high definition thin-film microwave components, typ­ ically to a lower definition thick film or printed circuit board  substrate.  the method described involves the formation of a  high definition microwave filter (5) on the surface of a trans­ parent, flexible carrier substrate (6) using thin film deposition  techniques, and the circuit element is then adhesive bonded  face down in an appropriate position in a thick film circuit (1)  on the surface of a second, permenent substrate (2).  the thin  film circuit element is formed with contact areas which over­ lap cooperating portions of the thick film circuit on insertion of  the circuit element to provide electrical connections.  the car­ rier substrate may then be removed, eg by dissolving, and the  overlapping contact areas may be permanently bonded  together.  thus only the high definition parts of the micro­ circuit need be fabricated using expensive thin film technol­ ogy.
