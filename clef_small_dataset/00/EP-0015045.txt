<ABSTRACT>
a method of determining the coordinates of the centre of  curvature of the curved surface of a workpiece with respect to  a predetermined frame of reference the origin of which coin足 cides with the centre of relative rotation between the work足 piece and a sensor of a surface measurement instrument.  the  method requires sensor signals to be derived at only three  points along the traverse of the sensor and there are no con足 straints on the position or symmetry of the three points  thereby allowing the method to be used on workpieces having  only a partial arc.  two output signals representing the x and y  coordinates of the centre are produced from signals repres足 enting the angular position of the three points and from the  sensor signals at the said three points.
