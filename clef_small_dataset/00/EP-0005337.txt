<ABSTRACT>
a process for preparing colloidal overbased alkaline  earth metal, particularly magnesium, additives in a diluent  oil wherein an alkaline earth metal oxide is reacted with  carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a hydrocarbon  solvent, the oil and a dispersing agent and the additive  recovered.  the water is added prior to or simultaneously  with the carbon dioxide.  the metal oxide is present in the  mixture in an amount in excess of that theoretically required  to produce an additive having a desired alkali value.   most importantly, the carbon dioxide is added at the critical  carbonation rate, which is defined as being that which  maintains the carbon dioxide concentration at a level which  causes the conversion of the metal oxide into colloidally  dispersed carbonate at a maximum relative to the conversion  thereof into undispersed products.  the carbon dioxide  addition is continued until the reaction is completed.  the critical carbonation rate is evaluated by treating  identical reaction mixtures at differing carbon dioxide  addition rates and selecting the rate which gives a product  having the highest alkali value.
