<ABSTRACT>
in the case of a roof, in particular industrial roof, having a covering comprising preferably trapezoidal sheets (1) which are provided with crimps (3) and covered on the outside with a heat-insulating layer (5) and a skin (6) made of bituminous webs, the crimps (3) of the trapezoidal sheets (1), in order to design for prescribed wind suction loads while retaining a simple construction from poorly flammable or non-combustible materials, are provided with a filling (2) on which are arranged the heat-insulating layer (5) and the skin (6), which are joined to the filling (2) and/or the trapezoidal sheets (1) at certain points, advantageously by means of gas concrete nails (7) with washers (8).  the individual fillings (2) can be part of a continuous layer and are expediently composed of lightweight cellular concrete.  in addition, for further strengthening, provision can be made for a reinforcement consisting of diagonally arranged sheet-metal ribs (10) which can consist of trapezoidal sheets fastened, at an angle of less than 45 deg , to the trapezoidal sheets (1) provided with the filling (2), with upwardly pointing crimp (11).  the skin (6) can also be arranged directly on top of the filling (2), followed by the heat-insulating layer and on top of this a lightweight cellular concrete layer (13) or a gravel layer.  <image>
