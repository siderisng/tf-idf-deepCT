<ABSTRACT>
a rope lock intended for preventing a rope (13) inserted  therein from being moved in a certain direction therethrough  by a pulling force in the rope.  the lock is primarily intended for  use as a sheet lock or a winch unloading lock on sailing boats.   the lock has an abutment (4), an operating member (6)  arranged pivotable about a first pin (17) in relation to the  abutment and a locking member (10) arranged pivotable  about a second pin (11) relative to the abutment.  the locking  member has a thrust portion (12) which forces the rope  towards the abutment with a thrusting force in the active  position, but not in the inactive position.  the locking member  also has a contact portion (14) for generating at least a portion  of this thrust force.  the lock is taken between active position  and inactive position by pivoting the operating member.  said  member has an operating portion (9) which is eccentric rela­ tive to the first pin, and which is adapted for providing a  torque about the second pin, at least in the active position,  such that the tope is held between the abutment and the thrust  portion.
