<ABSTRACT>
the axial gap between the rotatable hub (25) of a  railroad locomotive wheel (14) and the relatively stationary  thrust flange (21) of an adjacent axle bearing (12) is cover­ ed by a dust guard comprising an annular band (16) of  elastomeric material firmly secured to the circumference of  the thrust flange and having a portion (38) that overlaps  the wheel hub to cover the axial gap.  on the inside circum­ ference of the overlapping portion (38) there is attached a  felt tape (18) that slidingly engages the hub to form a seal.   the overlapping portion (38) is encircled by a large-diam­ eter hose clamp (40) that enables a desired amount and  no more than said desired amount of radial pressure to be  applied substantially uniformly around the felt tape.  this  improves the effectiveness of the seal in resisting entry of  dirt into the axial gap.
