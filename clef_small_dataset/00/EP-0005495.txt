<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for the remote gripping of a broken needle (2) used for drawing an electric cable through a conduit, comprising a sleeve (5) one end of which is fixed to an operating element, whereas the other end presents an opening (7) of a cavity in which are placed locking means (12) for the needle, these locking means being pushed at their end opposed to that near the opening by resilient means (14) in the direction of the opening along a conical area (9) of decreasing diameter in direction of this opening, characterized in that said sleeve (15) comprises an opening (7) of outwardly splayed form, the front end of which is destined to fill almost totally the entire inner section of the conduit, followed by a cylindrical constriction (8) of a diameter slightly superior to that of the needle, in that the locking means (12) define in the position near the opening an interior diameter inferior to that of the needle, and in that the resilient means (14) provide an axial passage permitting the needle to penetrate to the bottom of the cavity of the sleeve.
