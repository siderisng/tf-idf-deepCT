<ABSTRACT>
a method of practising column chromatography and like  techniques with a column bed of pervious material contained  in a tubular column support (1) aend having-its ends engaged  by end cells (6, 9, 10; 20, 26, 27) is characterised by at least  one end cell (20, 26, 27) being movable relatively to the col­ umn support (1) and being resiliently urged into continual  engagement with the adjacent end of the bed, thus accom­ modating any changes in the volume of the bed.  also disclosed are methods of packing a column support  with pervious material to form a bed for the practice of col­ umn chromatography or the like, involving resiliently urging  a movable end cell into engagement with an adjacent end of  a body of pervious material in fluent condition.  column apparatus suitable  for performing these  methods is also disclosed.
