<ABSTRACT>
1.  continuous operation double winding machine comprising two supports (5) for parallel-axis reels (2, 3) provided with discs (7) having hooks (41) situated in the same plane, a traverse mechanism (13) reciprocating perpendicular to the said plane, a transfer device (22) intended to modify the trajectory of the wire to cause the wire to pass in the vicinity of the drum of the empty reel and of the said plane at the moment of transfer, and a deviator device (23) cooperating with the transfer device, and intended to engage the wire in the path of the hooks associated with the empty reel, characterized in that the deviator device is constituted exclusively by a base (36) rotatable about an axis parallel to the said plane and situated in the vicinity thereof, by two rigid and elongated elements (37) fixed in paired positions on the base, and by rotational drive means (38), in that the said rotational drive means are associated with control means (25, 26, 27) for the transfer device and act upon the base in such a way that at the moment of transfer, the latter rotates through a predetermined angle, when the trajectory of the wire engages between the said rigid elements, the rotation of the deviator occurring in a direction such that the trajectory of the wire is moved away from the hooks associated with the full reel and brought near the hooks associated with the empty reel.
