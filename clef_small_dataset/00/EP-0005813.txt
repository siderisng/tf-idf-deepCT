<ABSTRACT>
there is presented a new process for producing homopolymers  and copolymers of vinyl and vinylidene halides by  means of the suspension polymerization procedure.  in this  new process, the reactor is run a few degrees warmer than  normal for the first part of the reaction and then followed by  a steadily decreasing temperature throughout most of the  rest of the polymerization in order to linearize the reaction  rate.  this allows one to charge more initiator and/or  monomer to the reactor thereby increasing productivity per  unit of time.
