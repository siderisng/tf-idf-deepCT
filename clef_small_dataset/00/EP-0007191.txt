<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns an improved antiperspirant mat­ erial consisting of a basic aluminium chloride polyhydroxy  compound complex of the empirical formula:   al₂ (oh)6-a c1α (h₂o)x ry   where r is a polyhydroxy compound having at least 2 carbon  atoms each of which is linked to a hydroxy group; a has a  value of from 0. 8 to4. 0, x has a value of from 0. 5 to 2. 5 and y  has a value of from 0. 2 to 5. 0.  the complex is characterized in  that on analysis by a size exclusion chromatographic proce­ dure it exhibits a fraction (referred to as the band iii fraction)  having a relative retention time within the range 0. 76 to 0. 82  within which there is contained at least 15% of the total  aluminium, less than 10% of the total aluminium being con­ tained in polymers having a size exceeding 100 angstroms

<DESCRIPTION>
antieerspirants the invention relates to antiperspirants. in our copending german application p 27 00 711.0 we have described basic aluminium chloride, bromide, iodide and nitrate compounds having enhanced antiperspirant activity. although basic aluminium compounds are well known to have antiperspirant activity it has been shown in the copending application referred to that an enhancement in the antiperspirant activity of basic aluminium compounds having an aluminium to chloride, bromide, iodide or nitrate molar ratio ratio of from 1.3 to 6.5: :1 can be obtained by prolonged heating of aqueous solutions of said compounds under certain conditions leading to the formation of higher polymeric species aving a size above 100 angstroms. the antiperspirant active compounds having enhanced activity are defined in the said copending application as those which in aqueous solution there is at least 2% by weight of the total aluminium contained in polymeric species having a size greater than 100 angstroms. the improved antiperspirant material may be obtained in powdered form by drying, e.g. spray ruing, the aqueous solution. this powder, however, has the disadvantage that it is not soluble in alcohol. us patents nos. 3,359,169 and 3,420,932 describe the preparation of alcohol-soluble complexes of a basic aluminium chloride and a polyhydroxy compound e.g. propylene glycol. in us patent no. 3,420,932 the pol-hadroxy compound is defined as one having at least 2 carbon atoms each of which is linked to an hydroxy group. a complex of aluminium chlorhydrate and propylene glycol is commercially available under the trade mark "rehyzrol" from the reheis chemical company, division of armour pharmaceutical company. this invention has for an object to provide novel alcohol-soluble basic aluminium compounds having good antiperspirant activity. according to the invention there is provided a particulate basic aluminium chloride/polyrydroiv compound complex of the empirical formula: a12 (oh)6-a c1a (h20) r where r is a polyhydroxy compound having at least 2 carbon atoms each of which is linked to a hydroxy grow; a has a value of from 0.8 to 4.0, preferably- 0.95 to 2.0; x has a value of from 0.5 to 2.5, preferably 0.75 to 2.0; and z has a value of from 0.2 to 5.0, preferably 0.3 to 2.0; which complex has less than 10% of the total aluminium contained in polymeric species having a size exceeding 100 angstroms and which has such size distribution of polymeric species that in the size exclusion chromatographic procedure described herein there is eluted a fraction between the relative retention times of 0.76 and 0.82 in which fraction there is contained at least 155 of the total aluminium of the compound. for convenience, such fraction is referred to hereinafter as the band iii fraction. the amount of alu- minium contained in the band iii fraction is preferably at least 20%, more preferably at least 25%, and may even exceed 80%, of the total aluminium. characterisation of materials containing species differing in size by means of size exclusion chromatography is generally know. the size exclusion chromatographic procedure for characterising the basic aluminium compounds of
