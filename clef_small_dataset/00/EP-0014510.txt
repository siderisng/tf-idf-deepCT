<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an optical terminating set for  time-modulated optical transmission signals.  the problem of  crosstalk attenuation of the terminating set specific for these  signals is solved by concentrically coupling a first glass fibre  (1) to a second glass fibre (2) with a larger core diameter in the  coupling area.  the signal emerging in the difference area  from the glass fibre with larger core diameter is supplied to a  detector (4) either via a mirror (3) or directly.

<DESCRIPTION>
high speed xinder for non-extensible yarns. this invention relates to a vertically mounted high speed winding device for substantially non-extensible yarns, for example, air jet textured yarns. as used herein the term "high speed winding" means winding at a yarn speed in the range of from at least 300 meters per minute to about 1000 meters per minute. the term "helix angle" means the acute angle between the helix or convolution of the yarn and a diametrical plane intersecting the convolution. several winding devices known in the art utilize relatively low speed yarn traversing means which has a diminishing stroke length as the yarn package builds in order to produce a package with conical ends. wnen such a device is used for high speed winding of textile yarns, the yarn is laid down on the package at a small helix angle fecause of a high yarn speed to traverse speed ratio. as a consequence of the small helix angle, the yarn package so produced tends t exhibit poor yarn take-off characteristics and also tends to have unstable conical portions due to sloughing of the yarn therefrom caused by inadequate cohesion between the yarn at the package ends and the package body. u.s. patent no*4 085 903 discloses a yarn winding device for false twist textured yarns1 i.e. extensible yarns, in which a vertically mounted rotatable package is driven by surface contact with a driven roller. an eccentrically mounted rotatable disc having a peripheral groove is poitioiied on a reciprocating traverse means which is adapted to traverse to and fro along the length of the package as yarn is wound thereon. the rotation oi the disc about its eccentric axis caused by the yarn travelling in the peripheral groove of the disc imparts a sinusoidal pattern to the yarn being laid down on the package thus providing a substantial angle between successive wraps of yarn on the package. the presence of the sinusoidal pattern and the substantial helix angle improves the take-off characteristics of the yarn and also ensures good cohesion between the yarn at the package ends and the package body i.e. the sinusoidal pattern effectively locks the yarn at the package ends into the package body. the yarn winding device disclosed in the aforementioned u.s. patent 4 085 903 is very satisfactory where used for the high speed winding of false twist textured or other extensible yarn. however, the winding device of u.s. patent 4 085 903, where employed for high speed winding of substantially non-extensible yarn, for example such a yarn produced by an air jet texturing device, has the disadvantages of high winding tension peaks and that at certain positions of the reciprocating traverse means the rotation of the eccentrically mounted disc tends to slow dowm at the point where the yarn path around the peripheral groove of the disc to the yarn package is at its shortest length. this slowing down of the disc rotation, which is believed to be due to the inability of the
