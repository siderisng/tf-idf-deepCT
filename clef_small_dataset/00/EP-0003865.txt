<ABSTRACT>
1.  a coupling between an upright (1) and a transverse element (2), particularly of a scaffold, in which the transverse element (2) is provided at its end with a pin (4) extending under an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of the transverse element (2), said pin engaging hookwise with an eye (3) provided at the side of the upright (1), the free end portion of the pin (4) projecting beyond the eye (3) having a substantially vertical slot (8), in which is provided a wedge-shaped pawl (9) which is pivotable around a pivot axis (10) between an inoperative position in which it does not hinder entering of removing respectively of the pin (4), and an operative blocking position in which it projects from the side of the slot (8), characterized in that the pin (4), the eye (3) and the pawl (9) have such relative dimensions that in the inoperative position of the pawl (9) a lever-shaped end thereof projects below the free end portion of the pin (4), while in the operative blocking position the end of the pawl (9) remote from the lever-shaped end cooperates as a cam surface with the adjacent lower edge (3') of the eye (3) and with progressive rotation of the lever-shaped end in the direction towards the upright (1) causes increased clamping of both parts.
