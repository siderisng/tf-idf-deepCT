<ABSTRACT>
The device for obtaining methane gas from organic waste has a fermentation space (300) and a postgraduate space (400), wherein the fermentation space is formed in its upper part as a gas collection space (700). The fermentation space (300) and aftergregate compartment (400) are connected via a pipe piece (200) in kind of communicating tubes. From the post-gain space (400), the derivative (130) leads via a hydraulic closure (140). A piercing (250) leads from the gas compartment (400) in the gas collection space (700) with a downwardly guided sheet to form a hydraulic closure. About the filling shaft (90) the system is charged. A conduit (100) connects the gassam melama (700) with the upper portion of the postgraduate chamber (400) from which a line (120) leads to a pressure equalization tank. In the line (100), a periodically opening and closing valve (110) is angeord Net. The device allows a continuous operation for methane gas generation, without it requires mechanical directions to destroy the gas evolution of the throat cover or prevent their formation.
