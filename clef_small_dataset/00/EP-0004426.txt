<ABSTRACT>
compositions useful as surfactants in the emulsification of  oils in aqueous media are obtained by blending two types of  polyester which are the products of condensation of an alk(en)yl  succinic anhydride with a polyalkylene glyol, the one type being  derived from an anhydride in which he alk(en)yl group contains  40-500 carbon atoms, e. g.  polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride,  and the other type being derived from an anhydride in which the  alk(en)yl group contains 8-18 carbon atoms, e. g.  dodecenyl  succinic anhydride.  the compositions are superior in effect to  either type of polester separately, in enabling emulsions of high  stability to be produced with a low energy input.
