<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for surveying the thermal topog­ raphy of a surface, in particular of human skin, wherein a layer  (14) of liquid crystals having cholesteric properties is applied  in contact relationship to the area to be surveyed.  the area to  be surveyed is then illuminated with a light (18) having a  wavelength in the visible spectrum range, and of shooting  with a photographic camera (1) a number of photograms  taken at various wavelengths in the visible range.  the camera  (1) is mounted for adjustment with respect to the layer (14) of  liquid crystals which covers the area to be surveyed, at least  one filter (16) is interposable between the objective (3) of the  camera (1) and the layer (14) of liquid crystals.  the apparatus  includes a light source (18) adapted for emitting either a  monochromatic light or a discontinuous spectrum light in the  visible range of the spectrum, which impinges on said layer  (14) of liquid crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a method for flurveying the thermal topography of a surface, in particular of human skin, and an apparatus imnlerìenting tile method. it is knorm that the temperature of human skin is currently detected with the aid of mercury thermometers, thermocouples, and thermistors. all these instruments have the disadvantage of having a certain thermal capacity. moreover, through their use, only the temperature of a small skin region can be measured, instead of a sufficiently large skin surface, to detect minimal temperature differences between one point and another of said surface, such as skin areas overlying veins and arteries which are slightly warmer than the adjacent areas, or in the pathological cases of subcutaneous tumoural tissues, which exhibit slight temperature differential with respect to the adjoining ones to survey the temperature of larger areas, the use of cholesteric liquid crystals has already been proposed. as is lmown from the most authoritative studies,cholesteric liquid crystals may be represented as a superpositionof layers of oriented molecules,which are oriented in each layer along a preferential vector such as to result in a helical structure having a certain pitch dimension. conventional temperature measuring methods exploit a phenomenon whereby the pitch of the helix dipends on temperature, thereby it becomes possible, by letting a light beam to impinge on the liquid crystals, to obtain a selective reflection which is directly related to temperature. thus, by coating a surface rath a light reflective film of cholesteric liquid crystals, isochromatic zones (of same color) will appear on said surface at the isothermal zones (of same temperature). also hnown is the use of mixtares of cholesteric liquid crystals of different nattires to obtainagood brilliance of the color. the application of the cholesteric substances is carried out either directly or indirectly following cladding or enca#sl1'ating in special supports. conventional techniques have some substantial disadvantages which affect their effectiveness. first of all, they have shortcomings as regards the ouantitabive evaluation of temperature owing to the difficult achievement of a correlation between the reflected wavelength and temperature. secondly, they provid#e no means of following the evolution of a thermal contour, and no detailed definition of the warm areas can be obtained, especially in the case of a tumoural nucleus0 this invention sets out to provide a method which enables the isothermal values of a surface, in particular a cutaneous one, to be determined quantitatively. within that general aim, the invention further provides an apparatus implementing said method in a reliable manner and such that it can be carried out by operators lacking any specific training. according to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a method characterized in that it comprises the steps of applying in contact relationship to the area to be surveyed a layer of liquid crystals having cholesterieproperties, and of illuminating then the area to be surveyed with a light having a wavelength in the visible spectrum range, and of shooting a number of photograms taken at various wavelengths in the visible range. advantageously, the
