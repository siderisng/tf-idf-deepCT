<ABSTRACT>
a solar heating panel comprises a conduit (2, 3, 4, 5) for  carrying a working fluid (6), such as water, for heating by  solar radiation energy.  the surface of the conduit facing the  sun has a highly reflecting surface (13) and therefore emits  little thermal radiation.  the reflecting surface may be a  polished conduit surface or a layer of aluminium foil fixed on  the conduit.  covering the reflecting surface (13) is a coating  (14) of a material absorbing to visible radiation and transpa­ rent to thermal radiation.  this coating (14) may be a layer of  hard carbon (18) deposited by glow discharge; or a semicon­ ductor such as germanium or silicon in the form of particles  in a plastics matrix.  alternately the coating (14) may be a  layer of germanium or silicon (17) covered with a thin hard  carbon layer (18); both layers (17, 18) being arranged to form  an anti-reflection coating at visible wavelengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
emi1.1 solar heating panels this invention relates to solar heating panels. such panels commonly comprise two spaced plates between which water flows to be heated by radiant energy from the sun. in order to absorb energy the outside cf the plates are coated with a black paint. unfortun & ely although black surfaces absorb visible radiation they are efficient radiators of thermal, infra-red radiation. an object of this invention is to provide a solar panel which absorbs visible radiation with low emission of thermal radiation. according to this invention a solar heating panel comprises a conduit through which a working fluid may pass for heating by radiation energy from the sun characterised in that the outside of the conduit has a highly reflecting surface covered with a thin layer which is absorbent to visible radiaticn, and transparent to thermal radiation, the thin layer may be a composite layer comprising a first layer of an infra red transparent material such as germanium or silicon next to the reflectinc; payer and a second layer of hard diamond like carbon coating; the composite layer forming an anti-reflection coating at visible wave- lengths. an additional very thin layer of oxide may be formed on the conduit to assist bonding of the germanium or silicon. alternatively the thin layer may be a single layer of glassy hard carbon or a semiconductor material in the form of particles held in a plastic matri such as polypropolene or polyethylene. the semiconductor material may be silicon, or germanium or other material having a band gap of 2-5 electron volts. the conduit may be pipes, or spaces between plates which may be flat or corrugated. the working fluid may be water protected with anti-freeze additives or any other suitable fluid. the highly reflecting surface may be a layer or aluminium, copper, silver, gold, chrone, or any other infra red reflecting material foil and may be glued to the outside of the conduit. klternatively the conduit may be polished or have a reflecting layer painted or evaporated thereon. the composite layer may be of germanium or silicon followed by glassy diamond like carbon preferably deposited by a radio frequency (rf) or direct current (oc) glow discharge r - techni-ues in layer of about 1 m (of germanium) and 0.08/im (carbon). the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which figure 1 shows a sectional view of a solar panel heating a domestic hot water cylinder, and figure 2 shows apparatus for applying a carbon layer to material. as shown in figure 1 a solar heating panel 1 comprises two plates 2, 3 spaced apart by end pieces- 4, 5. waster 6 contained between the plates is connected by an outlet pipe 7 to a heat exchange coil 8 in a domestic hot water cylinder 9. from the coil 8 the water is passed through a pipe 10, a pump 11, and an inlet pipe 12 back into the solar panel
