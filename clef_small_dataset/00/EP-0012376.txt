<ABSTRACT>
a process for producing simultaneously tetrahydrofu­ ran and 1,4-butanediol in any desired proportion which  comprises (a) reacting the acetic ester of 1,4-butanediol  with a theoretical or smaller quantity, based on said acetic  ester, of water (preferably 0. 2-0. 8 mole of water per mole of  said acetic ester) in the presence of an acidic catalyst, (b)  distilling, in the first distillation column, the reaction mix­ ture to separate it into a distillate comprising tetrahydrofu­ ran as major constituent and a bottom stream comprising as  major constituent the acetic ester of 1. 4-butanediol and (c)  subjecting, in the second reaction-distillation column, at  least a part of said bottom stream to a counter-current gas-­ liquid contact reaction with methanol, the quantity of said  methanol being preferably 1-5 moles per mole of the ace­ tate group of the acetic ester, in the presence of an acidic or  basic catalyst and, simultaneously therewith, separating the  reaction mixture into a bottom stream comprising 1,4-­ butanediol as major constituent and a distillate comprising  methyl acetate as major constituent.  by this process,  methanol and catalyst can be economized to a great extent.
