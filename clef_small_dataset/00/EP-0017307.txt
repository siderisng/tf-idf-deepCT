<ABSTRACT>
an article carrier formed from a unitary blank comprises  spaced side walls (1, 12) and end walls (4, 13:6, 14) foldably  joined along adjacent edges, medial partition structure (8, 17,  38:9, 19, 40) joined to the end walls and extending medially  inward of the carrier, handle structure (27, 28, 29, 30) secured  to the medial partition structure, a bottom panel (21) secured  to the lower edge of each side wall, an auxiliary bottom panel  (24) foldably joined to an end edge of the bottom panel and  disposed on top thereof, and the auxiliary bottom panel  being wider than the bottom panel.  the auxiliary bottom  panel improves the load bearing characteristics of the carrier  and is arranged so that successive carrier blanks can be  struck from sheet material with minimal wastage of the  sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
article carrier technical field this invention relates to article carriers with improved bottom structure and which are nestable with an adjacent carrier for the purpose of providing economy of material. background art article carriers are known which have a double thickness of paperboard material between critical points of article contact. an example of this style of carrier is disclosed and claimed in u.s. patent application ser. no. ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ filed ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ (docket d-1987). a related carrier is disclosed and claimed in u.s. patent 3,412,894. disclosure of invention an article carrier formed from a unitary blank comprises a pair of spaced side walls, end wall panels foldably joined respectively to the ends of the side walls, medial partition structure foldably joined to the medial edges of the end wall panels, handle structure secured to the medial partition structure and extending upwardly therefrom, a bottom panel foldably joined to the lower edge of one side wall, an auxiliary bottom panel foldably joined to an end edge of the bottom panel and disposed in overlapping face contacting relation therewith, and the auxiliary bottom panel being secured to the lower edge of the other side wall. brief description of drawings fie. 1 is an isometric view of a set-up carrier formed according to this invention; fig 2 is a plan view of a blank from which the carrier shown in fig. 1 is formed; figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 depict intermediate stages through which the blank of fig. 2 is manipulated and glued in order to form a complete and collapsed carrier as shown in fig. 8, and fig. 9 shows a pair of blanks disposed in a nested relationship. best mode for carrying out the invention in the drawings the numeral 1 designates a side wall of the carrier to the bottom edge of which a glue flap 2 is foldably joined along fold line 3. end wall panel 4 is foldably joined to an end edge of side wall 1 along fold line 5 while end wall panel 6 is foldably joined to the opposite end edge of side wall 1 along fold line 7. medial panels 8 and 9 are foldably joined to end wall panels 4 and 6 respectively along fold lines 10 and 11. medial panel 8 is provided with locking notch 8a. the other side of the blank is similar to that just described and includes side wall 12 to the side edges of which end wall panels 13 and 14 are foldably joined respectively along fold lines 15 and 16. medial panel 17 is foldably joined to end wall panel 13 along fold line 18 and medial panel 19 is foldably joined to end wall panel 14 along fold line 20. medial panel 17 is provided with locking notch 17a. according to this invention in one form, the bottom wall is formed of a multiple layer of paperboard material. specifically bottom panel 21 is foldably joined to the bottom edge of side wall 12 along fold
