<ABSTRACT>
improved electrophotographic apparatus and method for use with electrophotosensitive toner are disclosed for electrophotographic imaging.  improved image density, color separation and toner background depositation levels are achieved by triboelectrically charging a dry, powdered, electrophotosensitive toner by interaction with an applicator, e. g. , a magnetic brush 12 figure 1, and then moving such toner into contact with an oppositely-charged electrode member 2.  upon exposure of a light image of an original at the interface between the toner and image electrode, the unexposed toner particles transfer to the image electrode and the exposed particles are discharged and not deposited on that member.  a positive reproduction of the original is thus formed.
