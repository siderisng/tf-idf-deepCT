<ABSTRACT>
a set for containing and applying into a human anatomic cavity a metered quantity of doughy medical or contraceptive substance consisting of an expendable cannula (1) and of a piston carrying rod (7).  the cylindrical hollow (2) of the cannula is filled in with the medical or contraceptive substance and is closed at both ends (10, 11) by easily removable closing means (3, 5).  at the moment of using the set, the closing means are removed by the fingers, the piston (9) is introduced into the proper end (10) of the hollow (2), the cannula (1) is introduced into the anatomic cavity and the rod (7) is pushed along the hollow (2) untill all the substance is ejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
a set for containing and applying into a human anatomic cavity a metered quantity of doughy medical or contraceptive substance. the invention relates to a set for containing and applying into a human anatomic cavity a metered quantity of doughy medical or contraceptive substance; a hollow cannula acts as a container of the substance and a separate rod provided with a piston is suitable to be pushed into the hollow of the can nula in order to eject the substance after the introduction of the cannula into the cavity. there are doughy medical or contraceptive substances which are contained in tubes, as tubes for tooth-paste, ointments, cosmetic creams, and are to be introduced into bottom ar.ato- mic parts, as the vaginal or anal cavity. such substances packed in said tubes are generally applied by the following known means and procedure: the tube is sold together with a separate metering cannula which i: ,,rovided with a piston; the cannula is fitted for the tuoe nozzle in such a way that, if the tube is pressed, a required quantity of substance is removed into the cannula; the cannula is disjoinad from the tube nozzle and conveniently introduced into the anatomic cavity; then a piston is applied and pushed into the cannula in order to ejected the substance. the disadvantages of the above known means are that (1) the cannula is used a number of times and consequently must be made of durable and relatively expensive material, (2) the ca mula must be carefully cleaned and put away after every use and (3) these means are cumbersome and not easy for the user since the cannula must be filled in at the moment of applying the substance and aluo the tube must be taken with oneself. the invented set consists of an expendable cannula containing a metered quantity of substance and of a piston carrying rod that, at the moment of using this set, is introduced into the cannula and is pushed so as to eject all the contained substance in the proper anatomic cavity wherein the cannula is introduced. the cannula ends are closed by two convenient means which may be easily removed: the end into which ti.e piston is to be introduced is closed by a plug that extends into the can nula by a short length so that, once the plug is removed, the piston is introduced into the cannula short length which is not filled in with the substance; the opposite end is clo sed by a small cap. of course, the cannula will be of material and sizes suitable to the purpose, namely the material will be chemically suitable to the contained substance, the length fund the outer diameter will be suitable to the prescribed anatomic cavity and the capacity will be adequate with the required quantity of substance. the length of the rod comprising the piston will be substantially equal with the length of the cannula and the piston diameter will be adequate with the cannula hollow.
