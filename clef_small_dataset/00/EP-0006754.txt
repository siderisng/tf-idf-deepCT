<ABSTRACT>
a testing apparatus for cassette type tape recording  and/or playback machines has a cassette shell (10) for  mounting on the machine in place of the regular tape cas­ sette, the cassette shell having driven means such as spools  (14 and 15) displaceably mounted within the cassette shell  and adapted to be engaged and displaced respectively by  the forward and rewind spindles of the machine when either  of such spindles is actuated.  indicator means (22) indicate  the torque applied to either of the driven means by virtue  of an indicating pointer (24) adapted to move over a scale  from a central rest position to which the pointer is spring  biased, flexible means such as leader tape (18) intercon­ necting the pointer (24) to both of the driven means (14  and 15).  preferably the spring biasing and pointer are  integrally formed in a t-shape with a pivotal mounting (21)  at the junction of the t such that the arms (25) bend resil­ iently upon displacement of the pointer (24).
