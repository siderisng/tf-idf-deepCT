<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for synchronizing transmitting and receiving devices, in particular Digi-valley subscriber sites of a PCM telecommunication network by evaluating synchronizing words preceding messeni gnal blocks (NB), which, in compliance with a pause (P) of a parent transmitting device, in particular digital Agency will be received. In order to avoid the synchronization words for incrimination by message signal bits, a counter (Z) is used, which is continually connected by station clock and returns to each "1" bit in the received signal flow in its counter starting stand and the synchro is reached upon reaching its meter level Nizuring device releases. The time-tensioning time tension is dimensioned so that it exceeds at least the number of tights, over which in the received message signal block sequentially "0" bits can occur. Preferably, this period of time is almost as long as the pause (P). As a result, synchronizing word rating only takes place at times, to which a correct synchro nifier word can occur.
