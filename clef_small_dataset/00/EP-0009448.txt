<ABSTRACT>
In order to balance the tank 100 around its longitudinal axis of rotation and to allow work in broad daylight without the processing products can not be inadvertently discharged next to the tank, it is intended that the evacuation corridor is provided. (5) is delimited by two concentric cylinders (1 and 2) whose inner cylinder (1) is provided with said longitudinal slot (4) and whose outer cylinder (2) also comprises a cut or longitudinal slot (106) located at the Less approximately between the same two radial planes (101, 102) passing through the edges (4a, 4b) of the slot (4) of the inner cylinder (1) and constituting the evacuation orifice (6), that a partition Link (3) connects one (48) of the longitudinal edges (4a, 4b) of the slot (4) of the inner cylinder (1) to the opposite remote longitudinal edge (106b of the slot (106) of the outer cylinder (2 ), that the width of the inner slot (4) is such that the radial planes passing by edges longit UDINALS (4A, 4B) of the slot (4) of the inner cylinder (1) include an angle of about 45 Â° and that the central orifice of the removable lid (110) is designed to be waterproof and at Leave the processing liquid in the inner cylinder 1.
