1.  floor stand, produced from folded material, and having a container (1) for receiving and displaying goods, which container is fixed by its base (8) to a foot (2) of polygonal cross-section, which foot has walls which are hinged to one another by lengthwise folding lines and can be folded falt, the stand moreover having a first crosswise folding line (6) which, when the foot (2) is folded flat, rests against a lower edge (11) of the container (1) in such a way that the folded-flat foot (2) rests closely against the container (1), characterized in that the foot (2) is of tubular cross-section, that the container (1) rests on the foot (2), that a gluing tab in hinged to one of the walls of the foot (2) at it upper edge, the tab (7) being glued to the bottom (8) of the container (1), and that on the foot (2) there is provided a second crosswise folding line (4), parallel to the first crosswise folding line (6), but shifted in the direction of the end of the foot, the distance between the two crosswise folding lines (4, 6) corresponding roughly to the height of the container (1), so that the foot (2) can be placed in a u-shape around the container (1).
