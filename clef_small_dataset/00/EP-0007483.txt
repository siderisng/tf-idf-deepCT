<ABSTRACT>
to improve the manufacture of multicolored yarns in  which there are differences in the color tone along their  length, there is provided a multicolored yarn which is a spun  yarn consisting of a substantially untwisted bundle of core  staple fibers and several wrapping staple fibers winding heli­ cally around said bundle of core staple fibers, the said bundle  of core staple fibers comprising two or more kinds of staple  fibers which are different from each other in color tone or in  dyeability, and has, at random intervals, parts where staple  fibers of one kind cover up the other component or compo­ nents and parts where at least two kinds of components lie  adjacent to each other (a).  such a multicolored yarn is manufactured by simultane­ ously drafting two or more kinds of slivers or rovings (4,5),  which are different from each other in color tone or in dyeabil­ ity and placing them adjacent to each other or with a little  space between them, feeding the drafted slivers or rovings  through nip rollers (6) and twisting them, (9), thereby to pro­ duce a twisted bundle of staple fibers and free outside staple  fibers which are not twisted into said bundle of staple fibers,  then integrating said twisted bundle of staple fibers and the  free outside staple fibers which have not been twisted into  said bundle of staple fibers into a whole, and then detwisted  and taking up such by a winder (16).
