<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic bubble switch operates in a drive-to-transfer  mode when a rotating magnetic field is applied.  the switch  has a magnetic element (10) in the shape that defines the  letter "y" having two arms (16, 18) and a stem (20).  the  switch has at least one serration (24) on the arm (18) of the y  in the vicinity of the stem (20) and a conductor (14) which is  positioned over the end (22) of the stem of the y.  another  magnetic element (30) is located at a distance 1. 5w to 2. 0w  from the stem (20).  in the absence of current in said  conductor (14), a bubble positioned near the end (22) of said  stem (20) is propagated to said serration (24) as the magnetic  field rotates and then along the second arm (18), and in the  presence of current in said conductor (14), a bubble positioned  near the end (22) of said stem (20) is propagated  outward away from said stem as the magnetic field rotates to  said second magnetic element (30).
