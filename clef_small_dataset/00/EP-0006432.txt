<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing thermosetting silicone resins by reacting Si-loxanes of the general formula wherein OR¹ is an alkoxy group of primary or secondary ali phatic alcohols having 1 to 4 C atoms, R 2 is an alkyl and / or phenyl group, a one Value from 1.0 to 1.5, B has a value of 0.1 to 0.7, with low molecular weight polyhydric alcohols, such as ethy lenglycol, trimethylolethane and trimethylolpropane or a mixture of these alcohols, at temperatures of 100 to 160 ° C optionally in the presence of known transesterification catalysts and solvents under removal of the alcohol R¹OH in such a quantity ratio that corresponds to a SIOR¹ group approximately one COH group and the reaction in an implementation degree of 25 to 80% by cooling to a temperature, 100 ° C is canceled. The silicone resins presented according to the invention are virtually indefinitely storable in the uninchary state without changing the viscosity of the products or their solutions. They have excellent pigment compatibility and high curing speed. The cured siliconhar Ze connect high thermostability with good elasticity and good adhesion to metallic ground.
