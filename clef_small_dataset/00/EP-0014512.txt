<ABSTRACT>
a method of arranging a ground anchor in the ground,  said anchor comprising a shank and at least one helically  extending blade on the outer side of said shank, the shank  with the blade being screwed into the ground wherein after  the ground anchor is screwed into the ground, air or gas is first  injected into the ground surrounding the blade, after which a  hardening fluid is injected.

<DESCRIPTION>
method of arranging a ground anchor into the ground and ground anchor intended for carrying out said method. the invention relates to a method of arranging a ground anchor into the ground, said anchor comprising a shank and at least one helical blade arranged on the outer side of said shank, the shank with the blade being screwed into the ground. such a ground anchor as described, for example, in german patent application 1,634,671 is employed for may purposes, for example, for fixing or anchoring dam walls along channels and rivers, for anchoring high masts, air halls and the like. although such anchors screwed into the ground generally have a satisfying effect, the force that can be exerted on such anchors always strongly depends upon the conditions of the ground into which the anchor is screwed. during drilling operations it has been found, in practice that even at small intervals appreciable differences in the solidity of the ground can be assessed. the invention has for its object to provide a method of the kind set forth by which the ground anchor can be arranged in a simple manner such that in addition a satisfactory ground condition is safeguarded so that optimum fixation of the ground anchor in the ground is invariably obtained. according to the invention this can be achieved in that after the ground anchor is screwed into the ground first air or gas is injected into the ground surrounding the blade, after which a hardening fluid is injected. the air or the gas will drive out any water contained in the soil surrounaing the ground anchor so that the subsequently injected fluid can penetrate into the surrounding soil over a large distance away from the ground anchor without mixing with water. as a result an effective consolidation of the soil around the ground anchor an an effective fixation of the ground anchor are obtained. hardening fluids solidifying within a comparatively short time after injection into the ground are known, for example, from german patent application 2,819,974 and 2,820,963. a particularly suitable ground anchor for carrying out the method according to the invention is obtained, when the shank has, over at least part of its ienght, a passage which is open at least near the top side of the anchor and which communicates with the external side of the anchor through at least one bore located near the helical blade. thus the hardening fluid can be injected through the passage and the bore into the ground surrounding the anchor. the invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to an embodiment of the ground anchor in accordance with the invention shown schematically in the accompanying figure. the ground anchor illustrated in the figure comprises a hollow shank 1 surrounded over part of its circumference in known manner by a helical blade 2. in the embodiment shown the hollow shank 1 has at both ends inner screwthread 3 and ii respectively. into the lower end of the shank with

 claims   1. a method of arranging a ground anchor in the ground, said anchor comprising a shank and at least one helically extending blade on the outer side of said shank, the shank with the blade being screwed into the ground, characterized in that after the ground anchor is screwed into the ground, air or gas is first injected into the ground surrounding the blade, after which a hardening fluid is injected.   2. a method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the injection is carried out through the hollow shank.   3. a ground anchor praticularly intended for use in the method claimed in claim 1 characterized in that the shank has, over at least part of its length, at least one passage which is open near the top side of the anchor and which communicates with the external side of the anchor through at least one hole located near the helical blade in the wall of the shank.
