<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an operating unit for electric  selector switches.  the operating unit comprises a tubular housing provided  with stop means and an actuating assembly (39, 41, 45)  supported in the housing so as to be rotatable therein,  preferably in steps, the actuating assembly including an  actuator (41), and a handle (39) which is removably mounted  on the actuator and provided with stop means (63, 65, 67, 69)  cooperating with the stop means of the housing to determine  the maximum extent of rotatability of the actuating assembly,  both the handle and the actuator being provided with  interfitting means (59, 61 and 93-97) enabling the handle to  be selectively mounted on the actuator in different angular  positions with respect thereto, and thereby enabling said  maximum extent of rotatability to be varied.  this arrangement allows a selector switch to be readily  changed from a two-position switch to a more-than-two  position switch, and vice versa, simply be repositioning the  handle on the actuator.  preferably, the actuating assembly is supported in the  housing also for limited axial movement therein, and it  includes a contact actuating cam (45) which is connected to  the actuator (41) for rotation in unison therewith yet such as  to permit axial movement of the cam relative to the actuator.   this feature enables the selector switch with which the  operating unit is employed to be used as a pushbutton as  well as rotary switch.
