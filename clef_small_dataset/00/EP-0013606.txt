<ABSTRACT>
this invention provides a polymeric diffusion matrix  comprising glycerol, polyvinylalcohol, a water-soluble  polymer having hydration sites which in combination with the  remaining ingredients yields a matrix capable of sustained  release of a drug dispersed therein, and water.  the matrix  may further include a drug for topical or transdermal applica­ tion to a patient.  the invention also provides a method of  making the polymeric diffusion matrix and a drug delivery  device incorporating the matrix.  the matrix may be used in  the form of a package, which comprises the matrix (14)  embedded in a backing member (10) provided with a detach­ able cover layer (12).  before use, the cover layer is removed,  and the backing member applied to the patient by means of a  pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (26), so that the matrix (14)  is held against the skin of the patient.
