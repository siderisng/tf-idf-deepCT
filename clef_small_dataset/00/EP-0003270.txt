<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of welding fine wires on connection lugs.The method implements a tube-shaped wire welding and sectioning tool (9) acting by its terminal face (11) containing the welding wire (12), whose external strand (13) must beWelded on the pod (6).To perform a sectioning primer (16) by the internal angle (17) of the tube, a limited crushing H is obtained by contact (40) of a portion of the terminal face with the pod.The magnitude h is determined by choice of an angle P, created between the lug (6) and the terminal face (11) of the tube.Applications are those in the field of microelectronics, and particularly the connection of the integrated circuits on the encapsulation browncases.
