<ABSTRACT>
a filter network that exhibits a bandstop response com足 prises a network of basically low-pass or high-pass structure.   the network is developed by choosing a bandstop transfer  function, a fourth-order elliptic is disclosed, which is converted  to a low-pass function.  this function describes a passive low-足 pass lc ladder network including a negative impendance ele足 ment.  a bruton transformation is applied to the passive lc  network to give an active version including an ungrounded  negative resistance network (24) in a series arm and frequen足 cy-dependent negative resistances (36) and (38) in shunt arms  without requiring inductance coils for its implementation.
