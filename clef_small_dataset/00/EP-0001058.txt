<ABSTRACT>
1.  fault current-safety switch on whose base are arranged a totalizing current transformer (24), a tripping device and a switch lock and whose base accommodates switch contacts (1, 2) which are actuated by a drum switch (13), characterised in that a) in order to actuate the switch contacts (1, 2) there is provided in each case a contact lever (2) which is supported on the base (3) so as to be mobile in tipping fashion and influenced by a spring (5) and the drum switch (13) on its one side and on its other side bears a mobile switch contact piece (1) opposite to which is arranged a stationary contact piece (6) on a runner (7) which is electrically connected to a terminal (8) on its one side and on its other side changes into an external baffle plate (9) of a pile of quenching-plates (10) which are arranged beneath the terminals (8) ; b) a passage to the base (3) is closed by means of a bipartite sealing piece (16) whose one component (17) forms a receptacle (18) which is u-shaped in profile and beside which a small passage remains, and is designed in such manner that it can engage with the base and whose other component (20) covers the remaining passage and possesses a terminal shoulder (21) beside the first component ; and c) a covering cap (25) of the switch housing engages between the beating plates (27) of the switch lock (28), which is secured to its base, via a centering projection (26).
