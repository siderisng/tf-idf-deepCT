<ABSTRACT>
this is used in battery systems for poultry.  it consists of synthetic fibre woven fabric (trevira) with plastic coating on both sides.  at the edge zones in the running direction, there is a steel insert in cable form.  the cable is woven in or welded in the longitudinal direction by overlapping strips.  by means of the steel insert the following advantages are produced:   a) vermin, such as rats and mice, are no longer capable of gnawing through the belts.    b) tearing and thus overlapping of the conveyor belt is no longer possible.    c) a stiffening is additionally obtained in the longitudinal direction, which guarantees good side guiding and at the same time the running direction.
