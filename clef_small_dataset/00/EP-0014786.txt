<ABSTRACT>
a fire extinguisher comprises a container 1 formed of a  glass or other breakable material, and a fire extinguishing  material 2 sealed in the container 1.  the container 1 is detachably mounted on a ceiling or wall  of a room by means of end caps 4 and 5 having projections 6  and 7 engaged in grooves 11 and 12 of a u-shaped bracket 10  mounted on the ceiling or wall.  the container 1 breaks into  pieces when subjected to a specified temperature of less than  100°c to release the fire extinguishing material 2 in all direc­ tions.  in another embodiment, a container is provided with  many holes plugged with plugs of at least two different melt­ ing points or fire points so that under initially the holes with  low melting plugs open and if the fire takes hold the holes with  higher melting plugs open.  the material 2 contains disodium  hydrogen phosphate, sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate  and ammonium carbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
fire extinguisher this invention relates to a fire extinguisher which automatically ejects a fire extinguishing material there from, and more particularly to a fire extinguishing material which may prevent the spread of the fire and provide a barrier when a fire occurs by automatically ejecting fire extinguishing material in every direction. background of the invention hitherto, there have been proposed many fire extinguishing agents and extinguishing means which automatically extinguish fires. however, such fire extinguishers tend to be complicated to handle, of poor reliability in automatic operation and of complicated structure requiring various control means. in addition, the fire extinguishing agent used is sometimes harmful to human beings and animals and stains furniture and the clothes of persons involved in fire fighting. suis5ary of the in-vention it is a first object of the present invention to provide a relatively simple form of fire extinguisher which may be used to scatter-a fire extinguishing material in all directions to extinguish the fire. it is a second object of the present invention to provide a fire extinguishing'material which is not harmful nor stains clothes of persons involved in a fire fighting operation, and yet provides a strong fire extinguishing action or force. it is a third object of the -present invention to provide a relatively simple fire extinguisher which operates with a two or more stage action. according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fire extinguisher comprising a- container that is so designed-as to be broken into pieces-, when exposed to heat at a given temperature below 100 q, whereby the container is broken due to the heat produced at the initial stage of the fire, under an increased=internal pressure therein, so a fire extinguishing material in the container may be scattered around in every direction for extinguishing the fire. according to a second aspect of the pre-sent -invention, there is provided- a fire extinguishing-material in which three ingredients such as disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium sulfate and sodium bicarbonate are included and prior art ingredients such as ammonium sulfide and ammonium chloride are replaced by ammonium carbonate, so that there are produced gases which are not harmful to persons involved in the fire fighting and animals therearound and which do noç stain clothes of these persons. according to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fire extinguisher which may be suspended in a space, wherein the fire is anticipated, and which includes a metallic container having may holes in its bottom wall. these holes are closed with plugs of two or more kinds, the plugs of one kind having a relatively low melting point or fire point, and plugs of another kind having a relatively high melting point or fire point, whereby fire extinguishing material in the container is ejected through those holes closed by the plugs having a relatively low melting point when such plugs melt, to extinguish the fire in an initial stage, and the fire extinguishing material is ejected through
