<ABSTRACT>
a pneumatic force multiplying device for use in an  hydraulic brake system of a motor vehicle.  the device com­ prises a housing defined by a front shell (2) and a rear  shell (3), a valve body (4) slidably supported by the rear  shell and incorporating therein a valve mechanism (10),  a flexible diaphragm (9) connected to the circumference  of the valve body and extending in the radial direction to­ ward the outer circumference of the housing to divide the  interior of the housing into a front chamber (a) and a rear  chamber (b), and a piston plate (7) mounted around the  valve body and extending contiguous to the diaphragm.   a problem with a known device is that the front and rear  shells deflect appart under the influence of the multiplying  force.  in order to overcome this problem the pneumatic force  multiplying device of the invention is provided with a rigid  connecting rod (17) which extends through both chambers  and the opposite ends of the connecting rod are rigidly  secured to the two shell portions.
