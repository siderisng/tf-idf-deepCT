<ABSTRACT>
an electrically powered type ventilator for use in med足 ical applications.  the ventilator incorporates an expansible chamber  (20), a gas inlet/delivery port (21) communicating with  the chamber (20), an electric motor (35) coupled to a  rotatable shaft (39) and a motion translating mechanism  (40, 41, 42) which couples the shalt (39) to the chamber  (20) to impart expansion and compression strokes to the  chamber.  in order to avoid problems which are associated with  crank mechanisms which feature in prior art electrically  powered ventilators, the motion translating mechanism  (40, 41, 42) includes an element (42), preferably a positive  drive link chain belt, which is connected with the ex足 pansible chamber (20) and which is driven to move along  a linear path during expansion and compression of the  chamber.  expansion and compression strokes are imparted to  the chamber (20) preferably by use of two motors (35 and  36) which have their rotors mounted to a common shaft  (37), with the first motor (35) being arranged to drive the  rotatable shaft (39) in a first direction whereby successive  compression strokes are imparted to the chamber and the  second motor (36) being arranged to drive the rotatable  shaft (39) in a second direction whereby successive ex足 pansion strokes are imparted to the chamber.  the extent of the expansion stroke is preferably de足 termined by use of a timer device which operates to cause  de-energisation of the second motor after elapsing of a  predetermined interval of time.
