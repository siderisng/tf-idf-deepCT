<ABSTRACT>
a coupling structure for strengthening agricultural or in­ dustrial water channels is composed of a number of prefabri­ cated concrete products connected in series against any set­ tlement and upheaval.  connecting plates (1a, 1b) are engaged  with recesses (8,8) formed at adjacent concrete products (5,  5), respectively, and a bolt (9) is screwed through tightening  hole (2) into an insert (6).  after a bolt (10) is passed through a  hole (13) of an eccentric seat plate (11), the bolt is screwed  through a tightening hole (3) into an insert (7).  when the seat  plate (11) is rotated, the adjacent concrete products (5, 5) are  urged towards each other.  a stopper (4a) is provided in addi­ tion to a stopper (4b).  even if compressive force occurs be­ tween the concrete products (5 and 5) due to the settlement or  upheaval, it is partially born by the bolt (9), the plates (1a, 1b),  the seat plate (11), and the bolt (10).
