<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to snack products, particularly crisps, which consist of a dried, cooked minced meat, and to a process for producing them which consists in thoroughly cooking minced meat, cooling it and chopping it up into pieces with a high surface : volume ratio, particularly crisps, after which the small pieces are dried.  the advantage of these snack products lies in the fact that, unlike snack products which have been fried in oil and are based on carbohydrates, such as potato crisps, they are very low in calories and, due to their high protein content, are very good for human nourishment.  they therefore constitute a valuable broadening of the range of snack products.
