<DESCRIPTION>
immunisation agent, a method of preparing the same and use thereof for producing antisera. the present invention relates to immunisation agents and prepara- tions containing a particulate complex between hyaluronic acid and antigenic proteins. the invention further relates to a method of preparing such agents and to the use thereof for preparing antisera. in this context the term antigenic proteins refers to all proteins capable of inducing the production of antibodies in a host animal, such as allergens, vaccines, cell antigens, etc.. it is known that injection of suitable amounts of antigenic proteins into humans and animals gives rise to production of the corresponding antibodies thereby creating an immune defense against the respective antigen. by injection of antigens it is thus possible to obtain immunity against various allergies and deseases. when injecting only the respective antigens the immune response is, however, comparatively weak and the effect is comparatively short.this i.a. means that the treatment has to be repeated several times. e.g. up to thirty times or more for allergens. attempts have been made to eliminate these drawbacks by combining the antigens with various adjuvants. typical examples of such adjuvants are freund's adjuvant and aluminum hydroxide. further, conjugates of antigens with certain polysaccharides are known (see for example british patent specification 1,174,854). although these adjuvants contribute to an improved immune response they have severa. drawbacks limiting the practical utility thereof, and the purpose of the present invention is in the first place to eliminate or reduce these drawbacks. it has according to the invention surprisingly been found tha injection of a complex of an antigen with hyaluronic acid (which as such is a a non-antigenic substance naturally occurring in the body) gives rise to a strong and long lasting immune response already at very small doses of the antigen, if the complex is used in particulate form. when injecting such a particulate complex the antigen in question is released slowly (depot effect) and is resorbed extremely well. further, non-desired side effects at the time oi immunisation are avoided, and the'site of the injection is not harrnful!y effected. a solution containing an antigen and hyaluronic acid does not preser: the advantageous properties of the particulate complex according to the invention. examples of allergens, which can form a particulate complex with hyaluronic acid in accordance with the invention, are serum albumins. foodstuff allergens, mould extracts, animal epitel extracts, caracein extracts, various pollen extracts, etc. examples of vaccines, which can be complex bonded to hyaluronic acid in a corresponding manner, are i.a pertussis, tetanus, etc. according to the invention the complex antigen/hyaluronic acid has the form of a finely divided powder, which is suited for injection in the form of a suspension in any suitable physiologically acceptable liquid medium. the particulate complex preferably has a particle size of from 0.1 to 200 , especially from 1 to 100 p, and in particular from 5 to 60 p. the complex can be regarded as a difficultly soluble salt between the antigenic protein and thz hyaluronic

<CLAIMS>
 claims   1. an immunisation agent containing proteinous antigen, wherein th antigen is present in the form of a particulate complex with hyaluronic acid.   2. an agent according to claim 1, wherein the complex is a co precipitate of the antigen and hyaluronic acid.   3. an agent according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the   particulatecompre    has a particle size of from about 0.1 p to 200 p.      4.    an agent according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the particulat complex is suspended in a physiologically acceptable, especially aqueou medium.   5. an agent according to claim 1, 2,' 3 or 4, further comprising physiologically acceptable, non-antigenic protein.   6. an agent   according    to any one of claims 1 to   5,. wherein    th particulate complex   contains    hyaluronic acid and antigen in'a weight ratio c from about 1:2 to about   1;20.      7. an agent according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the antigen.   an allergen or a vaccine.    8. a method of preparing an immunization agent containing   protein    antigen in the form of a particulate complex with hyaluronic acid, comprisir the steps of reacting hyaluronic acid with the respective antigenic protein the presence of an aqueous reaction medium, lowering the ph value of   te    reaction mixture until a finely divided precipitate of the desired complex formed, and recovering the precipitate from the reaction mixture.   9. a method according to claim 8, wherein the precipitate formed treated with an inert organic solvent that can be mixed with water.   10. a method of producing antisera of a high titer, comprising the ste: of injecting an agent according to claim 1 into a host animal, taking bloc from the host animal when the desired amount of antibodies has been forme and working up the serum in conventional manner.
