<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for and a method of testing a plurality of  hydraulic and or pneumatic systems is disclosed in which  each such system has a hose (11) connected in it and the  hose (11) terminates in a valved fitting (12).  all of the fittings  (12) are releasably attached to a subassembly (13) which in  turn is attached to a manifold (17).  when the systems are to  be tested, a test fixture (26) is attached to the manifold (17),  such attachment automatically opening the valved fittings.   the test fixture also includes valved fittings (34) identical  with those connected in the systems.  all of the fittings are  opened by attachment of the test fixture (26), and the  appropriate tests are then carried out.  when the systems are  not being tested, the test fixture (26) is removed and a  protective cover (22) is applied to the manifold in place of the  fixture.
