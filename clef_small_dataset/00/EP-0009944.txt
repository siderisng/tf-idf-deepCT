<ABSTRACT>
 compositions useful in the control of fertility, the inhibi­ tion of malignant cell growth, and the control of other dis­ eases which accumulate macrophages at the disease site,  comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and lysosomotropic  substance comprising a weakly basic amine of pk 4. 5 to 9  containing at least one hydrophobic substituent or a peptide  conjugate hydrolyzable by lysosomal enzymes to a biologi­ cally active substance.  certain of the amines, viz.  those of formula:    in which r is an alkyl substituent of from 8-30 carbon atoms,  r₁ is hydrogen or alkyl, and r₂ is fluoroloweralkyl of 2-3 car­ bons, are novel and constitute another embodiment of the  present invention.  the compositions of the present invention are used to  inhibit or alter the function of lysosome-bearing cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention lysosomotropic detergent therapeutic agents summary of the invention this invention relates to compositions useful in the control of fertility, in the inhibition of malignant cell growth, and in the control of other diseases which accumulate macrophages at the disease site. more specifically, it relates to novel chemical compositions and pharmaceutical formulations comprising a weakly basic amine having a pk of from 4.5 to 9 incorporating a hydrophobic moiety or a peptide conjugate which is hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes to an active substance. background of the invention lysosomotropic substances have been designated as substances which are selectively taken up by lysosomes regardless of their chemical nature or mechanism of uptake. it has been suggested that the property of lysosomotropism is useful in the preparation of therapeutic agents having useful biological properties. these substances can enter the lysosomes preferentially and exert their biological influence because of their own unique biological activity. they also can be coupled with active drugs and, following preferential uptake by lysosomes, can be hydrolyzed within the lysosome with release of the active drug at the target area. thus, in one method of using the lysosomotropic agent dna, a complex of dna with the potent cytotoxic agent daunorubicin was formed. it was then found that the complex was preferentially taken up by the tumor cells and that the dna was preferentially degraded by lysosomes leaving the active daunorubicin within the lysosome. a drawback of this particular method is that the toxic dose is very close to the therapeutic dose which makes the margin of safety very narrow. description of the invention the present invention is concerned with the inhibition of lysosome-bearing cells. more particularly, the present invention is concerned with new compositions and new pharmaceutical formulations which are useful in inhibiting the function of lysosome-bearing cells. still more specifically, the present invention comprises novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a lysosomotropic substance comprising (a) a weakly basic amine having a pk of from 5-8 and at least one hydrophobic substituent which is preferably an alkyl or unsaturated alkyl substituent having at -ieat·b - tabo'atoms or on a substituted alkyl substituent having at least 4 carbon atoms, or (b) a peptide amide coupled through the amide function with a biologically active material which is readily hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes either within the lysosome or at the outside surface of the lysosome-bearing cell. more specifically, the present invention comprises novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and (a) an amine compound having a pk of from 5-8 of the formula: emi2.1 in which r is an alkyl or unsaturated alkyl substituent of from 8-30 carbons or a substituted alkyl substituent of from 4-30 carbons, r1 is hydrogen or alkyl, and r2 is an electron-withdrawing group to control the pk of the amine between 4.5 and 9 including fluoroalkyl such as trifluoroethyl or di fluoroethyl, carboxymethyl, cyanoethyl, hydroxy, methoxy, amino, alkylamino, and acylamidino; or (b) an alkyl-substituted, nitrogen-containing hetero cyclic compound having a pk of 4.9
