<ABSTRACT>
wheat gluten and starch are separated from wheat flour  by mixing the flour with from 0. 6 to 1. 0 part water per part  flour, maturing the mixture to form a dough and to hydrate the  gluten, diluting the dough with a further 0. 5 to 3 parts water,  and either simultaneously or subsequently applying shear to  the dough, e. g.  by agitation or extrusion, whereby the gluten  coagulates and thereafter separating the starch and gluten.   the starch/gluten may be separated by screening, in a  decanter, or using hydrocyclones.  the method is applicable to  whole wheat meal as well as to refined and partly refined  flour.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method of separating wheat gluten and starch from wheat flour" this invention relates to Ã¥a method for the separation of wheat gluten from wheat flour. the separation of wheat gluten from wheat flour is carried out in several well known ways, using doughs, in which the anount of water is equal to cr less than the amount of flour, and batters, in which the amount of water is greater than the amount of flour to proauce a free-flowing mixture. in the traditional iartin process, wheat flour and water are mixed into a dough and the starch is extracted from the dough by washing. in the continuous batter process, a free flowing mixture of wheat flour and water is produced, the socalled batter. after a certain retention time the starch is washed from the gluten by passing the batter to pumps, supplying substantial amounts of water to each pump at the same time. the gluten is then separated by sieving0 in a variant of this process, a starch fraction and protein concentrate are separated from a batter by centrifugal force. '2he gluten is not isolated from the liquid protein concentrate bt this is dried as a whole. it is however possible to agglomerate the gluten in the protein concentrate by agglomeration at a suitable temperature with strong agitation. the gluten agglomerates can be separated from the liquid protein concentrate by screening. in another variant of the batter process, a batter is prepared from at least 1.5 parts of water and 1 part of wheat flour. this batter is then pumped straight into a hydrocyclone battery wherein the gluten spontaneously agglomerates and starch gluten separation takes place in one step. the gluten leaves the hydrocyclone battery with part of the starch in the overflow, whilst the bulk of the starch leaves in the underflow. the agglomeration and separation takes place at a suitable temperature of 30 to 500c. the use of hydrocyclones, and the connection of them in series for separation of starch and undesirable materials is well knows. according to the present invention, a method is provided where the agglomeration of gluten is achieved by dilution of a fully developed dough and simultaneous or subsequent application of shear. the present invention accordingly provides a method of separating starch and gluten from wheat flour comprising the steps of producing a mixture of water and flour containing 0.6 - 1.0 part by weight of water per part by weight of flour; maturing this mixture into a dough by allowing the gluten to hydrate fully; subsequently diluting this dough with 0.5 to 3 parts by weight of water per part by weight of flour and either simultaneously or subsequently applying shear to the mixture whereby the gluten agglomerates and subsequently separating the starch and gluten. agglomeration of the gluten in the dough is an important step in the invention. when flour and water are mixed the gluten is dispersed in the water added to the flour to make a batter or dough. thus, in
