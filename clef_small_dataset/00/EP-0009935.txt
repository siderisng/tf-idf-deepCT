<ABSTRACT>
process for removing metal(s) and water from used hyd­ rocarbon lubricating oil characterized in that the said used oil  is treated with an aqueous solution containing a surfactant  and anions which form an insoluble salt or insoluble salts  with at least one metal present in the said used oil followed  by separation of an oil layer of reduced metal and water  content.  the oil so treated is suitable for refinery feedstock, and  also as fuel oil or as blendstock for other hydrocarbon pro­ ducts, or as rerefining feedstock.
