<ABSTRACT>
a method of cooking thin meat in a microwave oven  by determining the temperature of the thin meat as a function  of sensed and sampled "in-situ" time dependent  humidity and temperature environmental conditions of a  microwave oven heating cavity.  the method permits the  monitoring for doneness of meat while being cooked in  the microwave oven by determining the temperature at any  point on a "characteristic humidity curve" for the sensed  and sampled environmental conditions.
