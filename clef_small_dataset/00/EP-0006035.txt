<ABSTRACT>
a novel β-galactosidase comprises an enzyme having a  thermal stability such that when in purified form it has an  activity half life of at least 1 1 / 2 hours at 55°c, at least 1 hour at  60°c and at least 10 minutes at 65°c, as measured using  onpg as substrate, said enzyme being derived from a  bacterium of species bacillus stearothermophilus.  there is  also provided a process for the production of the novel  β-galactosidase, comprising culturing in a medium containing  appropriate nutrients a micro-organism of species b.   stearothermophilus having characteristics similar to or the  same as the strains identified as ncib 11407-11413, and which  contains the β-galactosidase of the invention.  additionally  there is provided a process for the hydrolysis of lactose to a  product comprising glucose and galactose which comprises  contacting lactose with the β-galactosidase of the invention  e. g.  at a temperature of at least 55°c preferably at least  60°c or especially about 65°c.
