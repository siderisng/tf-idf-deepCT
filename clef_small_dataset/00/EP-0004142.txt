<ABSTRACT>
a process is described for preparing compositions comprising  ethylene copolymers, such as ethylene-acrylate or  ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, and compatible liquid  hydrocarbons which act as inexpensive plasticizers or extenders,  the process enabling large quantities of inert, e. g.  inorganic  fillers to be incorporated more simply than previously  proposed processes.  the hydrocarbon is compatible if it  satisfies the test that there is no observable exudation of  hydrocarbon from the copolymer when 50 g.  of powdered  copolymer are mixed with a quantity of hydrocarbon in a  metal dish which is first heated to 120°c.  to fuse the  copolymer, second cooled and held at a temperature of  -20°c.  for 18 hours, and third warmed to room temperature.   the compositions may be prepared either in the form of  free-flowing powders or aqueous dispersions both of which  are described and both of which have advantages when used  in described situations as hot melt adhesives or coating  compositions, especially for carpet backing techniques.
