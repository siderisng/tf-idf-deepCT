<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to new berhicide effective and plant growth inhibiting 2-substituted 5-phenoxy-phenylphosphonic acid derivatives of the formula wherein R₁ and R₂ independently of each other per hydroxyl groups, lower alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylamino, dialkylamino, chloro, benzyloxy or benzylthio, x halogen or CF₃, NO₂ , CN, -CONH₂ or -CSNH₂, N a number of zero to 3 and y is a group OH, NO₂, CN, NH₂, -NHCOR, -NHCOOR, -NHSO₂-R or halogen, wherein R is an optionally halogenated lower alkyl radical represents. Preferably, 2-Nitro-5- (2'-chloro-4'-trifluoromethyl-phenoxy) -phenyl-phosphonic acid and their lower dialkyl esters. The invention also relates to the preparation of the new phosphonic acid derivatives from a 3,4-dinitro diphenyl ether and reaction with a trialkylphosphite as the first stage. Furthermore, the subject of this invention forms both herbicides and plant growth regulating means which contain one of these new active ingredients as an active component and the use of the active ingredients and means for weed control (also selectively), for the growth inhibition and desiccation of above-ground plant parts, as well as for total destruction Existing plant growth.
