<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a water-based fungicidal composition of low phytotoxicity containing cuprammonium complexes of carboxylic acids and an alkaline earth metal, zinc or manganese carboxylates.  the compositions are useful for protection of crops such as vines, coffee, tea, tobacco, peanuts, potatoes, apples, pears, cereals and hops against fungal infections due to their low phytotoxicity.  in addition they may be used as a wood preservative, to sterilise fungus infected walls and masonry, as a paint biocide, to prevent mildew on fabrics and to counteract growth of algae and marine fouling.  because they are water based they are relatively easy to handle and free from fire-hazards and environmental problems associated with fungicides based on organic solvents.
