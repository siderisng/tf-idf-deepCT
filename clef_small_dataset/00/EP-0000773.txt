<ABSTRACT>
Multi-chamber irradiation methods and multi-acumper photoreactors for cleaning, in particular sterilization and disinfection flowable media with UV beam and in the wavelength range of 240 to 320 nm in a flux reactor enable extensive utilization of the UV radiation outgoing from the radiation source at high flow rates. The irradiation space of an annular double-chamber photoreactor (200) with axially arranged UV radiator (24) is divided by a quartz glass tube (207) in two coaxial irradiation chambers (209, 211), which are thus connected to each other such that the medium under irradiation in the longitudinal direction The radiation source both irradiation chambers (209, 211) undergo in succession of the flow direction in succession. Other embodiments for multi-label photoreactors and surveillance devices for the fraction rate are described, as well as arrangements for the return operation. A modified two-chamber photoreactor (500) has separate irradiation chambers (509, 511) through which the medium is conveyed parallel, such as water purification by reverse osmosis. Application areas: stationary and mobile drinking water supply; Beverage and food industry; Pharmaceutical and cosmetics, chemistry and biotechnology; Reinswater for Clinic, Analytics, Electronics, Photo Processing; Climate washer; swimming pool; Aquaristics; Exterior treatment.
