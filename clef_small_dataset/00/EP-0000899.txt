<ABSTRACT>
Fuel, gasification air (primary air) and optionally a bonded oxygen-containing gas (exhaust gas) are converted into a fuel gas generator to a fuel gas and the fuel gas with engine air (secondary air) is burned in an internal combustion engine. The method consists of two steps: from measured values ​​for the accelerator pedal position, the speed and the reactor temperature are dimensionless setpoints for the fuel supply (B), the air numbers (Lambda₁₂, lambda₂₃) of the reaction and optionally a primary air content (Ba) to be replaced by exhaust gas, calculates, wherein the map of the internal combustion engine is taken into account. In the second step, setpoint values ​​for the volume flows of primary air (LV), secondary air (LM) and returning exhaust gas (AR) are formed from these dimensionless setpoint values ​​for the volume flows. The volume flows are set to these setpoints. In an increase in fuel supply, the ratio LV / LM is briefly increased according to the temporal change B for a short time compared to the stationary state with the increased fuel supply.
