<ABSTRACT>
in a matrix array for the supply of an electrographic stylus  writing apparatus, a plurality of styli (10, 11, 12, 13) are driven  by short pulses through r/c networks.  the styli are divided  into subgroups and parallel capacitors (22, 24) connect the  styli of each subgroup to a high voltage switch (23, 25) which  is responsive to a capacitor pulse driver (35).  each stylus is  also driven through a resistive line (14, 15, 16, 17) which  completes the r/c circuit.  the resistive lines are connected in  parallel for similar styli of each group to a resistor enable  pulsing circuit (33) and all resistive lines are connected via  isolation diodes to a resistor reset means.  in operation, a short  pulse from the capacitor driver circuit (35) is applied to all the  capacitors (22 or 24) of a single group and an enabling pulse is  applied to a predetermined single resistive line (14, 15, 16 or  17) of each group so that the combined, enabled r/c circuit  for a single stylus within one of the groups is activated.
