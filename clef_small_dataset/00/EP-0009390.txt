<ABSTRACT>
in a cathode ray video display unit which is designed  to display graphical and alphanumeric images, the marker  is made up by two orthogonal caresian axes xax, yax  which can be positioned by the operator or by the program.   the axes have the same luminosity as the lines of the dis­ played image.  the points of intersection p1-p5 of the axes  of the marker with the portrayed lines are caused to stand  out with increased brightness for the purpose of making  their relative positon more evident on the video unit.  the  the coordinates of the points which stand out (x1, y1, etc. )  and those of the origin of the axes (x0, y0) may be repro­ duced in the form of an alphanumeric message on part of  the screen.  the increased brightness is commanded by a  signal formed as the and function of the signal command­ ing the graphical display and a marker signal which is  generated at a predetermined point in every line scan and  throughout the whole of one selected line scan.
