<ABSTRACT>
1.  a process for the preparation of polyamines of the diphenyl methane series which are rich in ortho isomers, by reacting aniline with formaldehyde to produce n-substituted precondensates ; removing the water formed in this reaction as well as any water introduced in the form of aqueous formaldehyde solution ; rearranging the pre-condensate in the presence of aniline salts of strong acids to the corresponding primary amines substituted on the aromatic nucleus ; neutralizing the catalyst used ; and subsequently working up in known manner the resulting reaction products ; the quantities of reactants and of the aforesaid strong acids used being calculated so that the total quantity of aniline used corresponds to an aniline/formaldehyde molar ratio of from 4:1 to 20:1, and the total quantity of strong acid added, based on the total quantity of aniline used, corresponds to an aniline/acid equivalent ratio of from 10:1 to 1,000:1, characterized in that at least half the total quantity aniline used is combined with the acid to form an of aniline/aniline-salt mixture ; the mixture is heated to a temperature of from 100 to 200 degrees c, the n-substituted pre-condensate, which has been maintained pre-condensate, which has been maintained at a temperature of 0 to 100 degrees c, is introduced into this mixture ; and rearrangement of the precondensate is then completed at a temperature within the range of from 100 to 250 degrees c.
