<ABSTRACT>
a method for purifying crude argon containing argon,  oxygen and nitrogen comprises the steps of reducing the  amount of nitrogen in the crude argon to between a trace  and 0. 15% (by volume) and passing the remaining oxygen  and argon, together with residual nitrogen, through 4a  molecular sieve to separate the oxygen and argon.  the 4a  molecular sieve is particularly effective if steps are taken to  ensure that all the remaining oxygen and nitrogen has to  pass through a volume of 4a molecular sieve which is  wholly at or below -250Â°f.
