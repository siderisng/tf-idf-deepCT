<ABSTRACT>
the invention is concerned with sealing assemblies of  the type comprising two members which are movable rela足 tive to one another and in which one of the members has  a cylindrical surface and the other member contains an  annular groove, a sealing ring being located in the annular  groove and engaging the cylindrical surface.  a problem  with such sealing assemblies is that, when they are sub足 jected to substantial pressure diffenrentials, unacceptably  high leakage of gas or liquid past the seal can occur.  such  leakage is reduced in a sealing assembly in accordance  with the invention in that one (22) of the radially extending  walls of the sealing ring (20) includes a chamfered portion  (24) such that the axial dimension of the radially inner sur足 face of the sealing ring (20) is less than the axial dimen足 sion of the radially outer surface of the sealing ring, the  annular groove including a complementary shaped wedging  surface (26) for co-operation with the chamfered surface  (24) of the sealing ring (20).
