<ABSTRACT>
a shrink resistant flexible ceramic fiber and its process of  manufacture which comprises melting from about 40 to 65  weight percent of alumina with from about 35 to about 60  weight percent of silica, forming fibers from the melt, rapidly  solidifying the fibers, heating the fibers to a sufficient temper­ ature for a sufficient time to form microcrystals and cooling  the fibers to below the crystallization temperature before  macrocrystals can form.

<DESCRIPTION>
shrink-resistant refractory fiber and process for making same background of the invention a) field of the invention this invention concerns ceramic fibers and more particularly concerns refractory fibers commonly used for insulating high temperature furnaces. b) history 6f the prior art in the prior art, refractory fibers containing alumina were used as insulation in high temperature applications especially in high temperature furnaces. such prior art fibers which were flexible enough to bye easily applied to a furnace wall had a serious disadvantage since after being applied to a furnace wall, they tended to shrink at temperatures as low as about 1000 c and would seriously shrink, eg., as'much as 5%, at temperatures of about l25o0c. shrinkage of such prior art fibers or mats and blankets made from such fibers became totally unaccçptable at temperatures in excess of 1250 c. fibers or mats and blankets made from refractory .fibers which did not shrink at unacceptable levels at temperatures in excess of 1250"c were too brittle to perm such 'fibers, mats or blankets to be easily installed as insulation within a furnace. examples of materials which have insufficient flexibility for ease of installation are disclosed in u. s. patent 3,935,060 to blome et al, u. s. patent 3,865,599 and u. s. patent 3,982,955 to mansmann et al. an example ofa refractory fibrous material which has sufficient flexibility to be installed into a high temperature furnace is disclosed in british patent no. 1,481,133 assigned to the babcock and wilcox co, and published july 27,. 1977 subsequent to the making of the invention disclosed herein. this'material ,does not, however, have sufficient shrink resistance to make it desirable for use at temperatures above 125000. in areas unrelated to fibers, other prior art information is available concerning solid refractory substances which are pre-heated prior to use. among such prior art are u. s. patents 1,807,915; 2,102,976; 2,524,601; 3,754,950, 3,826,813; 3,857,923; 3,880,971 and 3,903,225. 'brief description of the invention in accordance with the invention, there is provided a shrink resistant flexible ceramic fiber comprising a microcrystalline combination of alumina and silica, which is believed to be microcrystalline mullite, manufactured by forming amorphous fibers from a melt comprising from about 46 to about 65 weight percent alumina and from about 35 to about 60 weight percent silica. after the fibers are formed, they are heated to a sufficient temperature for a sufficient time to form microcrystals. the fibers are then cooled. to below the crystallization temperature be fore macrocrystals can form. the melt from which the original amorphous fibers are formed is essentially free from alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides. the melt is also desirably essentially free from the oxides of boron, lead, copper and zinc. the invention further comprises the process for manufacturing the shrink resistant flexible ceramic fiber by melting from about 40 to about 65 weight percent alumina with from about 35 to about 60 weight percent silica. and forming fibers.from the melt followed by rapid solidification to form amorphous fibers. the amorphous fibers
