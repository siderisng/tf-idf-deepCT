<ABSTRACT>
a cable termination assembly for a kickless welding  cable of the type comprised of a pair of opposite pola­ rity mutually insulated lugs each having connected the­ reto a plurality of conductors which are helically and al­ ternately wound is characterized by a terminal including  a pair of mutually insulated terminal lug elements (16, 18)  each having an offset extension (32) with opposed reces­ sed contact surfaces (34, 36) and cable conductor connec­ tors (50, 52) secured to the terminal ends of the cable  conductors, each connector having a contact surface  (58, 68) for engagement with one of the recessed contact  surfaces (34, 36) of the terminal lug elements (32), the  relative configurations and orientations of the connectors  and terminal elements when fastened together being such  that the cable conductors at their terminal ends are sub­ stantially straight and parallel, and extend in alignment  with their respective relative positions in which they are  located in the cable adjacent the terminal ends.  thus,  the cable conductors of opposite leads are commonly  connected to respective terminal elements without ben­ ding, twisting and/or crossover of the conductors, thereby  substantially reducing bending strains and reactance for­ ces in the cable.
