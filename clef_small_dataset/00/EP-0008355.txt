<ABSTRACT>
1.  device for protecting data, which are stored in data processing systems, against unauthorized acces and which are combined to form protected objects (obj) which are to be equally treated in respect of the access authorisation and to which users (pi) have access rights which are dependent upon the type of operation to be carried out during access, comprising storage devices in the form of user-individual tables which contain details on the access authorisation assigned to the individual protected objects, and comprising control devices which respectively control the access to the data when the required access operation corresponds to the stored access authorisation, characterized in that the user-individual tables (prmi) respectively consist of a matrix having n lines, which respectively correspond to one protected class, and having m columns, which are respectively assigned to one of the access operations (opj) to be distinguished, that in addition to the user-individual storage tables (prmi), there is provided a further storage table which contains the protected class assigned to each protected object (obj) as protected position number (prnk), so that by means of a first addressing device (ar, acu), the assigned protected position number (pnrk) is firstly determinable from the further storage table for a protected object which can be derived from the instruction to be carried out, and by means of a second addressing device (ar, prr), commencing from a user identification as a base address (nadi) and from the protected position number (pnrk) as a distance address, the authorized line (k) in the respectively assigned matrix and, by means of the pending access operation (opj), the appropriate column are subsequently controllable, and that the storage location of the matrix which has been selected by the column/line selection directly decides on the required access (prijk) in the form of a yes-/no-statement.
