<ABSTRACT>
the apparatus for mixing fluids, particularly gases with  liquids as in aeration of sewage effluent, comprises a rotary  axial flow impeller (16) with hollow airfoil blades (18) com­ municating with a hollow drive shaft (30).  the blade profiles  define upper and lower, suction and pressure surfaces (50)  and (52) respectively and holes (38) are provided in the suc­ tion surfaces (50) for the venting into the liquid of gas  entrained into the hollow blades (18) through shaft (30) via a  flow control device (36).  to achieve high stripping efficiency,  each blade has a maximum camber length about 2%to 6%of  chord length located about 20% to 60% of the chord length  away from the leading edge of the blade, a maximum thick­ ness about 10% to 18% of chord length, and has its vent holes  located in a region of its suction surface (50) from about 60%  to 80% of the chord length from the leading edge.  the impeller  (16) is preferably mounted coaxially within a draft tube (10)  provided with radial vanes (46).
