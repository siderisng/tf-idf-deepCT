<ABSTRACT>
a sandwich element comprises a rigid core (1) enclosed within an envelope which includes two or more facing sheets (2) meeting at the periphery of the element, either directly or with an edge strip (3, 4) interposed therebetween.  the core may be foamed or unfoamed, and in either case it consists of or contains a plastics material capable of setting and possessing adhesive properties in its unhardened state.  along the periphery of the element outwardly tapering gaps are formed, either directly between two facing sheets or between a facing sheet and an edge strip, as the case may be.  during the manufacture of the element the flowable plastics material of the core penetrates into and through these gaps so that in the finished element it provides a bond between the opposed gap-forming surfaces of the envelope components supplementing the bond effected by the set material between the core and the respective envelope components proper.
