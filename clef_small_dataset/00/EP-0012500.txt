<ABSTRACT>
mineral-containing polymeric compositions of matter  having high aqueous dispersibility, and methods of syn­ thesizing the same, are disclosed which permit nutritionally  important elements such as calcium, magnesium, phos­ phorus, potassium, iron and certain trace elements to be  added in aqueous form to foods of all types without ad­ versely affecting taste qualities.  the compositions generally  are high molecular weight species having moieties of the  generalized formula    wherein m₁ und m₂ are preferably taken from the group  consisting of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, boron,  zinc, manganese and molybdenum, a₁ und a₂ are respec­ tively taken from the group consisting of hydrogen and the  alkali metals, and x is an organic acid moiety having at  least three carboxyl groups therein (preferably citrate).  the  synthesis preferably includes the steps of admixing in water  a cation source, a potassium phosphate source and an  organic acid, followed by heating and further agitation.   dispersibility of the compositions is enhanced by the use of  hydroxylcontaining adjuncts such as sugars or the like.   edible forms of the compositions hereof find particular  utility as nutritional fortificants in traditional or ersatz foods;  in addition, the compositions may be very useful in ferti­ gation programs where minerals are applied to the soil  during irrigation.  nonedible forms can be useful in virtually  any context wherein dispersibility is desirable.
