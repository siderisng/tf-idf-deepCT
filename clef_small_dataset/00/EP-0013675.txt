<ABSTRACT>
in a process for manufacturing slabs from slab elements which consists of a concrete facing layer, containing natural stone and colour-matched to the natural stone, and a concrete core layer, the layers are consecutively introduced into a slab mould and vibrated together, the moulding thus produced is left to set and harden in the mould, and the slab is then demoulded and aged.  in order to create such slabs which exhibit high strength combined with a widely variable contrast of the visible facing, which is notable for a bright surface without any reworking, the vibration of the concrete layers introduced into the slab mould (4) is carried out within a very precisely defined vibration period, at a speed of rotation of the oscillating unit (8) forming an integral part of the vibrator which lies at the upper limit of the middle speed range, the grains of the high-strength double-crushed double-screened natural stone chippings which are exclusively used being brought toward the bottom of the moulding, in a concentrated manner, and the concrete situated amongst the chippings being broken down into very fine constituents which envelop the chippings on all sides.  <image>
