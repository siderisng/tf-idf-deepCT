<ABSTRACT>
a method and apparatus for cleaning waste from the  area below machinery particularly textile processing machi足 nery.  one or more receiving members (7) substantially cover  the area below the machinery and an air flow is created below  the machinery and over the surface of the receiving member.   the receiving member is vibrated by a vibrator (9) indepen足 dently of the machinery to have a component of movement  perpendicular to the surface of the receiving member so  throwing waste into the air current.  the frequency of vibra足 tion is varied with time over a given range to ensure that all  different types of waste material are thrown from the receiv足 ing member into the air current.

<DESCRIPTION>
"cleaning waste from beneath 1achinery11 technical field this invention relates to a method and apparatus for cleaning waste from the area below machinery. while generally applicable, the invention may find particular use in cleaning waste including fly, trash and yarn fragments settling on an area beneath textile machinery, for example a carding machine, fly frame, spinning frame, loom or other piece of textile processing equipment. background art in the textile industry cleaning from beneath machinery has conventionally been effected by using an air nozzle to blow out the waste from below the machine to where it can readily be swept up for disposal. such a method has obvious disadvantages, and many pieces of textile processing machinery are now built to incorporate a closed space below the machinery from which air is sucked to remove waste to an exit duct from where it may be conveyed to a filter which removes the waste for disposal. the space under the machines can be relatively large and a powerful suction unit thus has to be used to achieve reasonable cleaning. even with such units cleaning is by no means ideal. it has been proposed in u.s. patent no. 4,081,888 to provide an air channel below machinery in a location such that waste can settle into the air channel. shutter means are provided which may be switched between an open position permitting entry of waste into the air channel and a closed position where communication from below the machinery to the interior of the air channel is prevented. in the latter position a restricted enclosure is thus provided and waste may be pneumatically removed therefrom in a more efficient manner than would be possible were an attempt made to suck waste from the whole of the area below the machinery. the provision of shutter means as aforesaid, which require mechanical operation, adds to the complexity of the machinery and the shutters are susceptible to jamming. disclosure of invention according to the present invention a method of cleaning waste from below machinery comprises allowing the waste to fall on to one or more receiving members substantially covering the area below the machinery, vibrating at least one of the receiving members independently of the machinery in a manner such that there is a component of movement perpendicular to the surface of the receiving member and such that the frequency of vibration varies with time over a given range, and creating an air flow below the machinery to remove waste from above the receiving member. from a further aspect apparatus according to the invention, for removing waste from below machinery, comprises one or more receiving members substantially covering the area beneath the machinery, and one or more variable frequency vibrators mounted so as to cause vibration of at least one of the receiving members independently of the machinery and with a component of movement perpendicular to the surface of the receiving member, and means for creating an air flow below the machinery across the surface of the

claims:    1. a method of cleaning waste from below machinery comprising allowing the waste to fall on to one or more receiving members (7) substantially covering the area below the machinery and creating an air flow below the machinery to remove waste from above the receiving member, characterised by the steps of vibrating at least one of the receiving members independently of the machinery in a manner such that there is a component of movement perpendicular to the surface of the receiving member and varying the frequency of vibration with time over a given range.    2. a method according to claim 1 characterised in that the frequency variations occur in a cyclic manner.    3. a method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the vibrations are stopped for a period between each cycle of frequency variations.    4. a method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the difference between the minimum and maximum frequencies in the cycle is at least 30 c.p.s.    5. a method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the frequency is varied from 3.33c.p.s.   te    83.33 c.p.s. in each cycle.    6. a method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the air current is created by blowing compressed air through the space below the machinery and applying vacuum to a duct (11) opening into that space.    7. apparatus for removing waste from below machinery comprising one or more receiving members (7) substantially covering the area below the machinery  and means (10, 11) for creating an air flow below the machinery across the surface of the receiving member or members, characterised in that one or more variable frequency vibrators (9) are mounted so as to cause vibration of at least one of the receiving members independently of the machinery with a component of movement perpendicular to the surface of the receiving member.    8. apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the vibrator (9) is such that its frequency of operation is in the range of   from3.33c.p.s.    to   83.33    c.p.s.     9. apparatus according to claim 7 or claim 8 characterised in that the receiving member is a single sheet (7), and the vibrator (9) is mounted directly on said sheet.    10. a carding engine having a frame (6) and means for removing waste from the area beneath the carding engine and within the confines of the frame, the waste-removing means comprising one or more receiving members (7) substantially covering the area below the carding engine and means (10, 11) for creating an air flow below the carding engine across the surface of the receiving member or members, characterised in that one or more variable frequency vibrators are mounted so as to cause vibration of at least one of the receiving members independently of the carding engine and with a component of movement perpendicular to the surface of the receiving member.
