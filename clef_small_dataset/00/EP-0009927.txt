<ABSTRACT>
an electrical connector assembly including an elongate  resilient synthetic resin channel member (14) for attachment  to a vehicle window, the channel member (14) having therein  a longitudinally extending channel (14a) of re-entrant cross-Â­ section.  an elongate electrically conductive part (17) is  arranged to be received as a snap fit in said channel (14a)  whereby one or more conductive heating elements (12) can  be trapped between said part (17) and the wall (16) of said  channel in electrical connection with said part (17).  the  channel member (14) has a surface (22) which supports said  part (17) within the channel (14a) in a position spaced from  the base (21) of the channel in a direction towards the open  face of the channel.
