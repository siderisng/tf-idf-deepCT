<ABSTRACT>
the structural system for furniture has one panel or member (1) connected to another panel or member (3) at right angles to it by pegs and tensioning members (5).  these tensioning members are made from metal rod, with each end bent over at right angles, forming a u.  the bent over ends are then inserted into holes (3a, 3b) in the edges of the panels.  multiple joints of this type are especially suitable for shelving, but such a right angle joint can be used for a table.  when used for shelving, the system gives easy adjustment by provision of a suitable set of fixing holes.  the joints combine adequate rigidity and load bearing.
