<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to 1-arylalkylimidazoles of formula    in which a is a straight or branched alkylene group of from 1  to 3 carbon atoms, or a straight or branched alkenylene or  alkynylene group of 2 or 3 carbon atoms, n is an integer  which is at least 1, and the or each r substituent, which when  n is greater than 1 may be the same or different, is a saturated  alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an unsaturated  alkyl group of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, with the proviso  that when a is unsaturated, r may also be alkoxy of  from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; (when n is at least 2) alkylenedioxy  of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; halo; trihalomethyl; hydroxy;  carboxyl; a salt of such a carboxyl group; carboalkoxy; carboaryloxy;  carboarylalkyloxy; -nr⁶r⁷ or -conr⁶r⁷, in which  r⁶ and r⁷ may be the same or different and are hydrogen or  alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; or an acid addition salt of  such a 1-arylalkylimidazole.  methods of preparing these 1-arylalkylimidazoles are  disclosed.  the 1-arylalkylimidazoles have pharmacological properties  of use in medicine, in particular for the treatment of  prophylaxis of thrombo-embolic disorders.
