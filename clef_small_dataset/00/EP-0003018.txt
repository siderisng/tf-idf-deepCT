<ABSTRACT>
method and apparatus for loading a fresh bale of stacked  wood pulp sheets (36) into a continuously rotating bale  milling cradle (12) of a fluff generator, usually on top of a  partially exhausted bale (10).  a bale loader cradle (24) is  mounted above the bale milling cradle (12) and is provided  with mechanism for selectively holding the bale loader  cradle (24) stationary while the bale milling cradle (12)  continues to rotate and while a fresh bale (36) is loaded into  the bale loader cradle (24).  when it is desired to transfer the  fresh bale (36) into the bale milling cradle (12), the two  cradles are driven in synchronism with the cradles aligned.   the floor (33) of the bale loader cradle (24) is then retracted  and gravity transfers the fresh bale (36) from the bale loader  cradle (24) into the bale milling cradle (12).  after transfer has  been completed, the bale loader cradle (24) is stopped in  alignment with a bale delivery conveyor (18) to ready it to  accept another fresh bale.
