<ABSTRACT>
a method for controlling the thickness or weight of  extruded stock.  an extruding system for the production of continuously  extruded elastomer, such as tread stock for the manufacture  of vehicle tires, has an extruder (12), a first take-away con足 veyor belt (16) for conveying the extrusion as it exits the  extruder, a second conveyor belt (17) for varying the thick足 ness or weight of the extrusion after leaving the first con足 veyor belt, a sensor (20) to measure the running-weigh-scale  value and a targeted running-weigh-scale value.  the weight  or thickness of the continuously extruded elastomer is con足 trolled by measuring the weight of the continuous extrusion  at the running-weigh-scale.  the measured value (rws 20) is  compared to the target value to obtain a control signal (38).   the control signal (38) is used (40) to adjust the difference in  speed between the first conveyor belt (16) and the second  conveyor belt (17).
