<ABSTRACT>
a hinge assembly (10) for pivotally mounting a vehicle  engine compartment hood (12) in position over an engine  compartment (15) for swinging about a first horizontal axis  (22) from a closed to an open position.  the hinge assembly  includes hinge members (24, 26) connected to the hood (12)  and engine compartment (15) respectively.  the compartment  hinge member (26) includes cam means (36) arranged  to be acted upon by a cam follower (54) carried on a force  transmitting member (40) pivoted on the compartment hinge  member (26) about a second axis (44) spaced from the first  axis (22).  a spring (58) maintains the follower (54) in contact  with the cam means (36) and applies a swinging force to the  hood in opposition to the weight of the hood so that a substantially  constant manual effort is required to swing the  hood through a substantial part of its swinging movement  towards the open position.
