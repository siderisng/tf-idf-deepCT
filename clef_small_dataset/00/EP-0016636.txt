<DESCRIPTION>
ccd read-only memory and method of fabrication thereof the invention relates to a ccd (chearge-coupled device) read-only memory (rom). there are two basic classes of solid state read-only memories (hereinafter reffered tzo as roms)namely, random access memories and serial access memories. random access mos roms are generally well known. they typically consist of a matrix of metal-oxide silicon-field-effect transistors (mosfets) that have been constructed with an alterable threshold voltage which is used to electrically indicate the storage of a binary "1" or "0". the second class of roms i.e., serial access memories are not known to be presentlycommercially available as mos devices. a typical solid-state rondom access rom is a mnos (metal nitride oxide semiconductor) memory device such as described by frohman and dentchowsky in procoedings iebe, vol. 58, august 1970 pages 1207 - 1219. the mnos structure describd in this publicationis configured in the form of a field-effect transistor fabricated on a semiconductor substrate having an insulated gate electrode and source and drain terminals that "current access" the stored charge in the transistors. a composite insulating layer disposed between the gate electrode and the semiconductor substance of the transistor consists of a thin layer of silicon oxide on er of silicon nitride has been applied. by voltage pulse on the gate electrode, charge carriers are transported from the semiconductor substrate to to the thin silicon oxide layer by meaiis of a phenomena known as tunnelling. the number of charge carriers trapped at the interface of the silicon oxide layer and the silicon nitride layer detemines the threshold voltage of tiie transistor, which voltage i. turn controls the magnitude cf +'e current flow between the source and drain trials for a specified read voltage on the gate electrode. however, the problem encountered with this prior mnos structure is that it requires at least one transistor per bit of binary information, so that the packing density is very small and limited. another method of determining the threshold voltage of a field-effect transistor gate in the above type of mnos structure is by injection of charge created during an avalanche breakdown in the seniconductor substrate of the transistor. a semiconductor memory device using this principle is known in the art as a famos (floating-gate avalanche metal oxide semiconductor) structure, and one such structure of this typ is described by dov frohman and bentchowsky in ieee journal of solid-state circuits, vol so6, october, 1971i pages 301-306. the device described in he latter publication is a field-effect transistor with a source, a drain, and an insulated floating gate e) ectrode in the form of a nonconnected conductive layer which is usually surrounded by insulating material and disposed above the surface of the semiconductor substrate. by applying a reverse bias of sufficient magnitude across the source substrate pn junction or the drain-supstrate pn junction to produce avalanche breakdown, charge carriers are generated at the junction. on account of the electrical field applied across the pn junction at reverse breakdown, the energy of these charge carriers
