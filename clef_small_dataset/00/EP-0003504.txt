<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a memory, used for storing data belonging to subscriber line facilities, of a centrally controlled switching system.  in the known memories of this type, the memory areas belonging to similar subscriber line facilities are in each case arranged spatially adjacently for simplifying the control sequences.  this can lead to problems when switching systems are extended by additional subscriber line facilities, but also in the case where a busy or faulty subscriber line facility is identified to be idle in its associated memory area.  the invention therefore proposes to allocate subscriber line facilities of different types to the individual memory areas which are located spatially adjacently, so that memory areas belonging to similar subscriber facilities are arranged distributed over the entire memory.  <image>
