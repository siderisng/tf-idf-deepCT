<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for selectively separating the uranium of its accompanying metals and to its recovery by treating an aqueous uranium solution with a collector, foaming by blowing inert gas, removing the foam and insulation of the uranium from the foam. In accordance with the method according to the invention, hydrochloric acid and alkaline or alkaline earth alkaline seams are given in such a quantity that the uranium forms complex anions of the type (UO₂Cln) N-2, wherein N is 3 or 4 or sulfuric acid and / or sodium sulfate In such a quantity that the uranium forms complex anions of the type UO₂ (SO₄) 2 / Z-2Z, wherein Z is 2 or 3. Together with the acid or after the addition of the acid, a cationic surfactant is added to the uranium solution, then the solution is floated in at least one flotation cell and separated into a conventional manner in foam and residual solution. The uranium-containing foam is dehydrated and the residue dissolved in a little water at a temperature above the Krafft point. From this solution, the uranium is precipitated by pH elevation as uranate. The surfactant remaining in solution is recycled.
