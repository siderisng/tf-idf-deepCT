<ABSTRACT>
a vegetative stigmata therapeutic agent contains as an  effective ingredient a human umbilical cord extract which is  obtained by the steps of subjecting a human umbilical cord  to a physically-destructive treatment such as crushing treat­ ment, ultrasonic treament, repetitive freezing and melting  treatment and the like, or to a proteolytic decomposing  treatment by the use of acids or enzymes, or to both treat­ ments and then extracting the umbilical cord extract from the  destroyed and/or decomposed umbilical cord by a solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
description technics field this invention relates to an autonomic imbalance t ti@ agent extracted from human umbrical cords which has a remarkable clinical application in autonomic imbalance. background art in recent years, many people have been suffering autonomic imbalance, and influenced by complicated and versatile surrounding factors such as domestic, social or cultural problems, those people are increasing in number. autonomic imbalance indicates a condition that generally locks symptoms of organic disease, and by the dysulfunction of autonomic nerves, the balance of the vegetative nervous system (sympathetic and para.sympathetic) is lost, and has colourful equivocal symptome such as ease of getting tired, stiff shoulders, headache, dizziness and benumbed extremities. this autonomic imbalance is classified, though the classification differss between scholors, in three classes, the neurotic an onotic inbalance which is closely involved in a psychlogenic origin, the revesosomatic autonomic imbalance where equivocal symptoms are complained of according to the reciptocal interference of psycho and autonomic central nervous system, and the essential autonomic imbalance which is bassed in the imbalance of the autonomic central nervous system. the so-called climacteric disturbance of woman is also thought to be a symptom of autonomic imbalance. the majority of this imbalance is said to be seen in the age of i@@nties and thierties, and more in women, is also @@id is occur in summer and change of the @ison@, @e@@er, @t@omic imbalance i not only seen by adults, but the symptoms of bronchial asthme, nocturnal enuresis, and cyclic vomiting in nursing babies and infants are said to have their cause in autonomic imbalance. psychological situations such as anxiety and tension from their adolescent surroundings and constitutional abnormalities and the like with the variety of circumstance in these days causes autonomic imbalance among the younger generations. the imm autonomic i@@@nce" as used herein illust- trates the following syndromes caused by dysfunction of autonomic nervous, for instance, e clic vomitiv (so-called autotoxication), nocturnal e uresing nursing babies, autonomic imbalance of respiratory aparatus (constitutional iterative catarrhel symptoms), cyclic vomiting (@@-called autotoxication), and nocturnal unuresis and autonomic instability in infants of primary schools, psychogenic autonomic imbalance (anxiety, tension, suggestion somatisation etc.), hypersensitive intestinal syndrome, gastric neurosis, nervous vomiting and others in middle-, highschool and college students, climateric disturbances (climacteric autonomic nervous imbalance), autonomic lumbago (pelvic congestion), gynecological postoperative autonomic imbalance, postnatal (or postabortive) autonomic imbalance, autonomic vertige and sensitiveness to cold in havewise and @@@@less of age and sex, headache, dullhead, ease of getting tired, stiff shoulders, insomnia, gastreintestinal cisturbance, chilly extremities, dizziness, asthenopia and other such symptoms, gastrointestinal neurosis, laryngeal neurosis, orthostatic disturbance, climacteric disturbance (headache, art@@algia, stiff shoulders, feeling of fatigue, frigidity langour, feverisch feeling, vertigo, esr noise, fatique, chilly extremities, inammetence, numbness of extremities), vertige in postespital and cervical injury, headache, dullhead, numbness of extremities, feeling of ease of getting tired, cervical, lumber, dorsal and scapuler stiffness and pain are those symptoms. for these symptoms of autonomic imbalance, many kinds of treatements have been cycloped, for instance, autogenic training, simple psychosomatic therapy, transactional analysis, lorita's therapy,
