<ABSTRACT>
in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam from a  polyol having at least two reactive hydrogen atoms as deter­ mined by the zerewitinoff method, a polyfunctional isocyan­ ate and a blowing agent using a polymerization or gel catalyst  and a blowing catalyst the blowing agent comprises water  and from 10 to 90% of methylene chloride, the polymerization  or gel catalyst is chosen from organic and inorganic tin com­ pounds and preferably certain stannous salts of monocar­ boxylic acids, and the blowing catalyst comprises a mixture of  certain carboxylates of antimony, potassium and zinc.  the invention makes possible the preparation of low  density polyurethane foams that exhibit a uniform cell struc­ ture.
