<DESCRIPTION>
product with choleretic activity. and the therapeutic compositions which contain it as active principle this invention relates to the use in human therapy of &alpha;-methyl-&alpha;-(3,4- dihydro-1-naphthyl )-acetic acid of formula emi1.1 &alpha;-methyl-&alpha;-(3,4-dihydro-1-naphthyl)-acetic acid has already been prepared (j. chem. soc. 2799 - 2805 (1969) during the course of a purely chemical study of ss-hydroxy acids. no possibility of direct industrial or human therapy use for this compound has ever been indicated. it has now been quite unexpectedly found that compound (i) has strong cho leretic activity accompanied by very low acute toxicity and by the absence of chronic toxicity during prolonged administration at therapeutic doses, and this forms the subject matter of the present invention. in compa prison with the best known oholereticsx compound (i) represents considerable and unforeseeable progress from many aspects. it is known that the primary effect of a choleretic agent is to increase the bile flow and the quantity of solid substances excreted with the bile. a good choleretic must provide this effect in a sufficiently intense and prolonged manner. in addition, as in the case of all drugs, it must have low acute toxicity and good general tolerability, but in particular must be free from toxic effects on the organ on which it is required to act, i.e. the livers whether this is in a normal or pathological state. the analysis of the new product in comparison with the best known products for the same therapeutic use has therefore been focused on these aspects. the choleretic activity of the new product has been determined in the rat by using the bile fistula method. we star rats of both sexes and having a weight of between 180 and 240 g were used. the animals, which were kept fasting for 12 hours but with free access to water, were narcotised by ethyl urethane in a dose of 1 g/kg by intra peritoneal or intramuscular injection. after binding the animals to the retention bed, a median laparatomy was carried out, and when the bile duct had been isolated a cannula needle was inserted into it. a polythene tube was then inserted into those ani mals which were to receive the products intraduodenally, after which a su ture was carried out on the abdominal wall, and the bile was allowed to discharge for 30 minutes after inserting the cannula in the bile duct, so as to allow the discharge to become normal. the bile was then collec ted for one hour. having determined the volume of bile discharged during this first hour of collection (base volume), the products under examination were administered at the predetermined doses and by the predetermined methods. the bile excreted by the individual animals was then collected over each hour for a further six hours. during the experiments, the animals were kept at ambient temperature of about 220c, and at regular intervals of two hours received 10 ml/kg of physiological solution s.c. the liquids were administered at a temperature of 370c, the bile flow and
