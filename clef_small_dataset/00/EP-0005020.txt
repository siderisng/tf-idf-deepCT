<ABSTRACT>
a method of connecting a metal braid to a metal  member including the steps of crimping a strip (15) of metal  around the braid (16) so that the strip (15) is electrically  connected to, and physically grips, the braid (16).  the  crimping operation in effect rolls the two end regions (17) of  the strip (15) so that they extend towards the intermediate  region of the strip (15) trapping the braid (16).  the two rolled  end regions of the strip (15) are then engaged with the metal  member (14) and a weld between the rolled end regions (17)  of the strip (15) and the metal member (14) is effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a method of connecting a metal braid to a metal member having particular but not exclusive reference to connecting a metal braid to the terminal rod or wire of a diode of the press-fit type. a press-fit diode has a semi-conductor diode chip housed in a metal cup with one terminal of the chip electrically connected to the cup and the other terminal electrically connected to a metal rod or wire which extends from the cup through a glass seal. the glass seal is fragile and so a predetermined length of the terminal wire or rod must extend beyond the seal so that mechanical forces and/or heat used in making a connection to the rod or wire are isolated to some extent from the seal by the length of the wire or rod. a known method of connecting a copper braid to the wire or rod terminal of the diode involves a tag which is crimped to the braid, the tag having a projection thereon which is projection welded to a flattened region of the wire or rod terminal. while producing an efficient electrical and physical connection this method suffers from the disadvantage that it produces a diode arrangement which is large in terms of the length of the wire or rod plus the connector tag since the crimped region of the tag and the region carrying the projection are spaced in the direction of the length of the tag and wire or rod terminal. it was proposed to overcome this length problem by dispensing with the tag and using in its place a strip of metal which is bent to define a band then crimped around the braid, the strip carrying a projection on its face, which after crimping, is opposite the two ends of the strip. this proposal proved unsat isfactory in that after crimping of the strip around the braid, the subsequent step of projection welding the crimped strip to the flattened region of the terminal of the diode caused the crimp to open thus releasing the grip of the strip on the braid. it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of connecting a metal braid to a metal member, which when utilised to connect a metal braid to the rod or wire terminal of a diode or similar semi-conductor device results in a shorter device than the known method and which does not suffer from the disadvantage mentioned in respect of the previously proposed method. according to the present invention, a method of connecting a metal braid to a metal member includes the steps of crimping a strip of metal around the braid so that the strip is electrically connected to, and physically grips, the braid, the crimping operation in effect rolling the two end regions of the strip so that they extend towards the intermediate region of the strip trapping the braid, contacting the two rolled end regions of the strip against the metal member and

claims   1. a method of connecting a metal braid to a metal member, including the steps of crimping a strip of metal around the braid so that the strip is electrically connected to, and physically grips, the braid, the crimping operation in effect rolling the two end regions of the strip so that they extend towards the intermediate region of the strip trapping the braid, contacting the two rolled end regions of the strip against the metal member and effecting a weld between the rolled end regions of the strip and the metal member.   2. a method of connecting a metal braid to a metal member, including the steps of crimping substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as shown in the accompanying drawings.   3. a metal braid connected to a metal member by the method claimed in claim 1 or claim 2.
