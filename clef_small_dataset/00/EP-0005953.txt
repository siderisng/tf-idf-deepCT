<ABSTRACT>
a surface acoustic wave device comprises a quartz  substrate having a flat surface (7,8) carrying one or more  transducers for lauching and receiving surface acoustic  waves along a track (k1, k2) in the flat surface.  the flat surface lies in a plane rotated about a y axis by  plus or minus 41째 to 47째 from the z plane and the track is  aligned 61째 to 67째 from the y axis.
