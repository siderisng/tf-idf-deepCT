<ABSTRACT>
a method for supplying a liquid to a mat (11) of wood  particles to be pressed to boards and a device for carrying out  the method.  finely divided liquid, e. g.  water or a wax disper­ sion, is supplied to the mat (11) synchronous with the deposi­ tion of wood particles from the forming station (10).  the same  amount of liquid per unit of surface of the mat will be supplied  as the liquid is fed to the mat (11) synchronous with the  deposition of wood particles from the forming station (10).  a  device for carrying out the process comprises a forming sta­ tion (10), equipped with nozzles (17a, 17b) for liquid and outlet  means, which are arranged in such a manner, that liquid will  be fed from the nozzles (17a, 17b) simultaneously with the  operation of the forming station (10).
