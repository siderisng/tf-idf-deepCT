<ABSTRACT>
a flame forming burner (10) for simultaneously minimizing  excess air consumption while suppressing nox  emissions.  a dual zone air register (14) is provided to  supply primary air in substoichiometric quantity into mixture  with fuel to produce a flame in a primary zone.  additional  air is introduced around the flame and downstream  of the initial combustion site in a secondary zone (24), in  sufficient quantity to complete combustion.  in the preferred  embodiment, primary air is provided through a venturi  throat (26), and secondary air is provided through an annular  passage equipped with vanes (34, 36) which generate  dual counter-rotating (dcr) air flow surrounding the  primary zone.  dampers (54, 56) for each register control  the primary to secondary air ratio.  preferably, a divergent,  non-circular throat (12) provides flame shaping.
