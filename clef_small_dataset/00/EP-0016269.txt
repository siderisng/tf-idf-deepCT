<DESCRIPTION>
an imero=ted f7.sctric plug assemely this invention relates to the manufacture of an electric plug assembly of the kind in which the plug pins and associated conductor terminals are mounted in a preformed body of electrically insulating material, the conductors of a length of flexible insulated irnilti-conductor cable ar-electri- cally connected to appropriate terminals of the plu and a moulded plug body of electrically insulating material wholly or partially encapsulates the preformed body and the plug pins and associated conductor terminals with an appropriate length of each pin protruding from a face of the plug assembly (hereinafter referred to as the rear face) and is permanently bonded to the insulating covering of a part of the length of the cable. electric:.plug assemblies of this kind will hereinafter, for convenience, be referred to as "of the kind described". the invention is especially, but not exclusively, concerned with three pin electric plug assemblies of the kind described suitable for use with domestic electrical appliances and with other three pin electric plug assemblies of the kind described which incorporate means for electrically connecting a cartridge fuse between the line pin and its associated conductor terminal. according to the present invention we provide an improved electric plug assembly of the kind described3 wherein a preformed cover of an electrically insulating material that is substantially harder than the moulded insulating material of the plug body is encapsulated in the moulded plug body and is oft such a shape and form and is so connected to the preformed body that it bears against and overlies the inner ends of at least the line and neutral pins and associated conductor teriinals.thereby to hold said pins firmly in position in the preformed body and to form a guard between said terminals and the outer part of the plug body preferably, the preformed cover bears against and overlies the inner ends of all the pins and associated condoctor terminals thereby to hold all pins firmly in position in the preformed body and to form a guard between all terminals and the outer part of the plug body. the provision of the preformed cover serves the dual purpose of holding the plug pins against which it bears firmly in position during moulding of the plug body and: of eliminating or substantially reducing the risk that a conductor wire or conductor wires may protrude through the moulded plug body and constitute a dangerous hazard to a user of the plug. preferably, the preformed cover is initially detachably connected to the preformed body in which the plug pins and associated conductor terminals are mounted and in a preferred embodiment the preformed cover has protuberances which are snap fits in appropriately located holes or recesses in the preformed body. in a preferred embodiment the preformed cover comprises a top and a side wall or side walls, an aperture being provided in a side wall, or one of the side walls being omitted, to provide access for the flexible cable. the preformed cover may
