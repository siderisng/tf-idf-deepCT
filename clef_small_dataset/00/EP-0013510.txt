<ABSTRACT>
yarn winding apparatus to produce a package with a  conical end is known in which a friction roller (15) drives a  rotatable package (11), the yarn y being supplied over a disc  (17) eccentrically mounted to rotate on an l-shaped lever (18)  pivoted by a pin (19) to a vertically reciprocating layrail (20),  the other end of the lever (18) having a slide block (22) running  in a guide (23) which rotates round a pivot (24) as the package  (11) increases in diameter.  when used with substantially  non-extensible yarn, the speed of rotation of the disc (17) is  liable to vary considerably, causing unacceptable yarn packÂ­ age characteristics.  the invention overcomes this problem by  passing the yarn over a dancer roll (29) on its way to the disc  (17).  the dancer roll is mounted on a spring balancing means  (31) which allows it to move towards and away from the disc.
