<ABSTRACT>
in a multiple purpose collapsible ladder whose side rails are connected by in each case one articulation (2, 2a; 5, 5a; 6, 6a) lockable into a plurality of working positions, which articulation has two hinge parts swivellable about a common articulation axis, of which the first hinge part has a double-shell blocking disc which is concentric to the articulation axis and which carries recesses open at the edge which are distributed in the region of its periphery and correspond to the working positions, into which recesses a spring- loaded blocking piece guided longitudinally displaceably on the second hinge part can engage, which piece can be lifted out of the particular recess of the blocking disc by means of a release lever swivellably mounted on the second hinge part and connected to an actuating lever (21), in each of the articulations (2, 2a; 5, 5a; 6, 6a) a spring- loaded holding part is preferably arranged, by means of which the release lever is momentarily automatically lockable in the position corresponding to the lifted-out blocking piece as a function of the particular mutual angular position of the two hinge parts and which can be automatically brought out of engagement with the release lever by swivelling one of the two hinge parts about the articulation axis.  in order to facilitate the unlocking of the articulations for the user of the ladder, the release levers of the articulations (2, 2a; 5, 5a; 6, 6a) assigned to the two side rails of the ladder can be connected together by means of a shaft passing axially through a hollow rung (20), which shaft can be rotated by a single actuating lever (21) arranged on the outside of one side rail.  <image>
