This is achieved in that the totality of all symbols of a respective font in coded form divided into a plurality of groups in dependence on their read-on-plan and cutting characteristics and formed with these groups a matrix, wherein the groups forming the series of matrix forming groups In the setting of standing and the groups in the columns of the matrix form the following symbol of a run-range-corrective symbol combination, and that the running range of the symbol first remote in the symbol of the symbol is reduced against over the following by a value predetermined in the respective tongue point of the matrix.
