<ABSTRACT>
In the process for producing an insulation structure (9) in a semiconductor body (1) extending from a surface of the semiconductor body (1) into it, on a surface of the semiconductor body (1), a cross-section of the insulating structure (9) Parallel to this surface corresponding pattern (6.8) generated from a metal. Then, it is heated until a metal-rich melt of the semiconductor material forms. Subsequently, the surface of the melt facing the semiconductor body (1) is allowed to move into the metal-rich melt in the semiconductor body (1) under conversion of further semiconductor material into the metal-rich melt by producing a positive temperature gradient in the desired direction of migration. The high-level semiconductor regions resulting in the migration process are anodically etched to form porous semiconductor material and eventually oxidized to form porous silica. The entiled dielectric material is homogeneous. The generated insulation structure (9) is used in particular to isolate semiconductor regions of deaucrically from each other.
