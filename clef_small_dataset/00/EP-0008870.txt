<ABSTRACT>
an aseptic packaging machine (1) is provided with con­ veyor means (2) for supporting and moving flanged contain­ ers (c) in sequence through a sterilizing bath (10) and thence  into a filling station (14) where the product to be packaged is  supplied to the containers (c) following which sterilized lid  stock (s) is heat sealed in overlying relation to the containers  (c), heat and pressure being applied through the lid stock (s)  by means (25) including a flexible membrane (m) heated by  heated liquid (l) so as to activate adhesive on the lid stock (s)  and thereby to effect a bond between the lid stock (s) and the  container flanges (f) in such a way that pressure and temp­ erature are imparted in a uniform fashion to the sealing areas  of the lid stock (s) and container flanges (f) due to the fact  that the flexible membrane (m) may conform to the shape of  the area to be sealed and may thus form a three dimensional  seal.
