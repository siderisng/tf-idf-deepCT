<ABSTRACT>
it is known to use sands in combination with a thermosetting  resin binder to make foundry molds.  olivine sands,  usually comprising a mixture of magnesium and iron silicates,  are normally preferred to silica sands in applications  where moderate temperature stability is required for the  mold.  however, olivine sands have the disadvantage that  molds made therefrom must either have unacceptably high  binder contents resulting in defects in manufactured metal  shapes or have low tensile strength leading to disruption  of the structural integrity of the mold shell in some applications.   the invention overcomes this disadvantage, and  enables production of molds having high tensile strength  comparable to those made using expensive zircon sands  without unacceptably high binder contents, by using an  olivine sand which has been treated an aqueous alkali metal  silicate solution to provide a covering of alkali metal silicate  on the sand particle surfaces.
