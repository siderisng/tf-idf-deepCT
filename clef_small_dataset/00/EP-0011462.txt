<ABSTRACT>
a brake for a steel tape (2) wound on a drum (4) in a  casing (6) includes an elongate resilient brake member (12)  pivotally mounted at one end in the casing (6).  when the  brake (12) is in its curved rest condition it defines with a  backing member (8) a gap (18) through which the tape (2) can  pass when being wound on or unwound from the drum (4).  a  control knob (22) is slidably mounted in the casing (6) to  move the brake member (12) between its rest condition and a  straightened operational condition in which the other end  (16) of the brake member clamps the tape (2) against the  backing member (3).  in one construction, a cam (26) on the control knob (22)  can be located in one or more recesses (28) in the brake  member (12) to effect positive locking of the brake member  (12).  in another construction, a cam (32) on the control knob  (22) is locatable in an aperture (34) in the brake member (12)  when the brake member (12) is in its rest condition, and the  cam (32) is arranged to ride over a front face (36) of the  aperture (34) to reduce the movement of the control knob  (22) required to move the brake member (12) between its rest  and operational conditions.
