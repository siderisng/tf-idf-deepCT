<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to compounds of the for­ mula    wherein y and w represent independently oxygen or sulfur;   t represents lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halo.  cf₃ or  no₂;   m is an integer of from 0 to 2;   n is an integer of from 1 to 3; and   r is selected from the group consisting of    morpholino, pyrrolidyl, pyrrolidyl substituted by from 1 to 2  lower alkyl or lower alkoxy moieties and -h₂)a, where a is  an integer of from 5 to 8 inclusive;   r₁ represents lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, benzyl,  phenyl or phenyl substituted by from 1 to 3 lower  alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, cf₃ or no₂  moieties;   r₂ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkenyl  moieties.  examples are given for the preparation of  said compounds.  the invention also relates to the  use of said compounds in a method of regulating  leguminous plant growth as well as to plant growth  regulant compositions.
