<ABSTRACT>
a cold forming apparatus adapted to form simultaneously  a plurality of either external or internal straight spline  or gear type teeth on a cylindrical workpiece (20) carried  on a movable ram (92).  in one embodiment the apparatus  includes a plurality of radially disposed pivotally mounted  teeth forming blades (170) which are disposed around the  axis of movement of a linearly movable ram (92), whereby  when the ram moves in one direction past the teeth forming  blades (170), the blades (170) are engaged by an interference  contact with the workpiece (20) carried on the ram (92) and  the teeth forming blades (170) are moved over the external  surface of the workpiece (20) in a rolling contact action  so as to displace the material of the workpiece (20) between  each tooth forming edge of each of the blades (170).  the  material on the external surface of the workpiece (20) is  formed around the radius of each of the tooth forming edges  of each of the forming blades (170) on a line with the configuration  of each tooth forming edge.  in another embodiment  the apparatus includes a plurality of radially disposed,  rotary type teeth forming dies (260).
