<ABSTRACT>
radiophotographic unit (10) for use in taking chest or  other x-rays, including a dispenser (18) for the dispensing of  one film sheet (16) at a time and a film holder (14) which  receives the film sheet (16) and holds it tightly between intensifier  screens (32,34) and which then releases the film sheet  (16) for developing.  the film sheet (16) and intensifier screens  (32,34) are sandwiched between a backing plate (38) and a  plastic sheet (36).  an elongated vertical pressing device (54)  can be moved against the middle of the backing plate (38) to  deflect it into a curve and thereby cause the film sheet (16) to  be held tightly against the intensifier screens (32,34).
