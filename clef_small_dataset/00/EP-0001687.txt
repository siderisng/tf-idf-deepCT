<ABSTRACT>
in the production of phosphorodichloridothionates difficulties  are encountered in purification.  in the known processes  many impurities result.  a multi step process is provided  which leads to a substantially pure product.  this process  comprises chlorinating bis(phosphorothioic) sulphides, thioic  acids, or salts thereof, distilling the reaction mixtures, contacting  the distillate with a thioic acid or salt thereof, contacting  the mixture with water and distilling the organic material after  the water contacting.  in a representative example dimethyl  phosphorochloridothionate is prepared from dimethyl phosphorodithioic  acid by chlorination, distillation, reaction of the  thionate distillate with dimethyl phosphorodithioc acid to  produce a semi-pure thionate reaction mixture which is then  contacted with water.  the organic layer is then separated and  distilled to product an over 99% pure product.  the residue is  recycled for reaction with the thioic acid in the first step of the  process.
