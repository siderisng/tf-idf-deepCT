<ABSTRACT>
ethanol is produced by reacting methanol with carbon  monoxide and hydrogen at temperatures in the range 150 to  250Â°c and pressures greater than 100 bar in the presence of a  cobalt catalyst and an additive which is miscible with  methanol containing up to 20% w/w water, which additive is  an alcohol, an aldehyde, a ketone or an ether.  particular additives  are n-propanol, n-butanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, 1,4-dioxane,  tetrahydrofuran, di-n-propylether and diphenyl  ether.  optionally the catalyst is promoted with iodine or  bromine or preferably both iodine or bromine and an  organo-phosphorus compound.  other additives such as  non-polar solvents, acids and derivatives thereof and inert  liquids can be incorporated in the reaction mixture.
