<ABSTRACT>
the piezoelectric properties of a polymeric material,  for example polyvinylidene may be enhanced by "poling",  which usually involves the application to the material, whilst  at an elevated temperature, of a high voltage electric field.   the enhancement is however limited by the temperature and  electric field that the material can tolerate.  further enhancement  is obtained by exposing the material (1) to a quantity  of γ radiation (4) of between 1 and 200 mrads before  «poling»; best results are obtained at an exposure level of  between 1 and 100 mrads.  the treated material is suitable  for use in microphone transmitters, receivers and pressure  transducers.
