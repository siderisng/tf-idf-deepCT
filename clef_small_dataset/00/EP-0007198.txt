<ABSTRACT>
an igniter (7) for gas or oil fuelled boilers and other  appliances uses a carbon cored silicon carbide or other  ceramic monofilament as a heating element.  
</ABSTRACT>
<DESCRIPTION>
igniter field of the invention the invention relates to fuel-ignition in heating boilers or other domestic or industrial gas or oil fuelled appliances. background we have sought alternatives to the electronic and piezoelectric spark ignition systems now widely used in gas cookers, domestic central heating boilers and similar gas equipment, and to resistance-heated rod igniters that have been proposed but not to our knowledge used, at least in the united kingdom. our aim has been an igniter that is not unduly position sensitive in equipment so that design and layout are not restricted, that allows an energy input sufficiently high to give positive and reliable ignition with natural gas, that works at voltages and powers safe and easily provided by inexpensive means, and that is easily serviced by gas and heating fitters. we have also sought to meet the standard requirement that ignition times of 2 to 5 seconds and preferably 3 seconds or less shall be attainable, and also that in domestic equipment a power rating of 10 watts or less at suitable voltages such as the standard 24 volts for many control units shall be used. rod igniters of silicon carbide cannot meet these requirements, being used at mains voltage with high power requirements, and any attempt to scale down the conventional ceramic techniques by which they are made gives bodies that are too fragile to use. among published prior proposals are: jeidel austrian specification 71645 (1916) auergesellschaft gmbh german als 1 133 842 (1959) carborundum co. german ols 1 629 895 (1967) " german ols 2 501 894 (uk 1 497 871x1975) none of the prior art proposals meet the difficult task of simultaneously satisfying the criteria we have given above, for gas ignition primarily but also for oil. the present invention we however have found successful a fuel-ignition device comprising an electrically conductive carbide, boride, silicide, nitride, oxide or other ceramic monofilament as a heating element and means for passing a heating current tothe filament to raise it to fuel-ignition temperature. the filaments on which the success of the invention depends are made for example, by vapour deposition onto a preformed core or by drawing from a melt, and show a high tensile strength, up to 340 kg/mm in one particular silicon carbide filament we have tested. such strengths may be contrasted with typical strengths below 10 kg/mm for ceramic bodies made by conventional ceramic techniques such as extrusion of plastic mixes, pressing,tamping and the like, whether or not followed by final machining stages. to provide for ready conduction of current in the cold, and guard against a surge of current as the filament warms up from ambient temperature, the filament desirably has a more conductive core of carbon or of tungsten or other metal. a carbon core is preferred, on which for example silicon carbide, the preferred ceramic, is readily vapour deposited. silicon carbide filaments are produced for example for reinforcement purposes in composite materials, and one particular filament that is suitable for the present
