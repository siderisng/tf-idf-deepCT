<DESCRIPTION>
title reco(;nlns m ani) l and t1iilil chemoreciprocals this invention is directed to a group of compounds, herein termed itecognins. recognins are made by treating normal or tumour cells or artificial cancer cells, and separating the desired products. the recognins may be used to prepare their chemoreciprocals, i.e., by contacting wit body fluids unsupported recognins or the recognins on a support. these chemoreciprocals are useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, i.e., for diagnosing and treating cancers. the chemoreciprocals are substances which react with immunochemical-like specificity with a ltecognin in vivo or in vitro, e.g., in a quantitative precipitin test, in ouchterlony double diffusion or in immunofluorescence. recognins and their chemoreciprocals as novel groups of compounds were first referred to in my u.s. application serial no. 941,940, filed september 13, 1978; which in turn was a continuation of my u.s. application serial no. 852,200, filed november 17, 1977; which in turn was a continuation of my u.s. application serial no. 621,112, filed october 9, 1975, which in turn was a continuation-in-part of each of my u.s. applications serial number 553,075, riled february 25, 1975; serial number 550,432, filed february 18, 1975; serial number 450,404, filed march 12, 1974; and serial number 385,451 filed august 3, 1973; and also a continuationin-part of my u.s. apptiication serial no. 922,799, filed july 7, 1978. reference should also be mude to my u.k. patents nos. 1,524,221 and 1,32,803 and also to my u.k. patent no. 1,533,464 (which claimed priority from the above-noted u.s. applications serial nos. 550,432; 553,075; and 621,112). furthermore, reference should be made to my copending european application no. 79 301315.2, filed on july 6, 1979 (claiming priority from the above-noted u.s. applications serial nos. 922,799 and 941,940. one of the recognins is astrocytin. astrocytin is produced from brain tumour tissue, preferably brain glioma tumour tissue. protein fractions containing the astrocytin precursor are first extracted from the tissue. a preferred method of accomplishing the extraction is to treat the tissue with a neutral buffer under conditions of homogenization or other techniques to disrupt the cells and tissues in order to solubilize protein fractions which contain the astrocytin precursor. at this point, the astrocytin precursor is still bound to many large moleculr weight substances including proteins, glyco-proteins, lipoproteins, nucleic acids, nucleoproteins, and so on. the solublized proteins are separated from the resulting tissue extract. the extract solution from the tissue is clarified to remove insoluble particals. the low molecular weight contaminants are removed from the resulting solution, by a perevaporation concentration technique. the solution which is obtained' is then treated to cleave astrocytin precursor from other contaminants in order to obtain the protein fraction having a pk range between within the range of from about 1 to 4, inclusive. thus, for example the solution is placed on a chromatographic column and eluted with increasingly acidic solvents. all of the fractions which are eluted in the neutral or acid range down to pk 4 are discarded, hd those fractions with the pk range 1-4 are
