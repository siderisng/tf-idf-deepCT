<ABSTRACT>
process for preparing homogeneous compositions of  olefinic polymers in flakes and of additives, suitable for the  direct transformation into manufactured articles, consisting  in mixing the polymer with the additive and with a third  component, acting as coupling agent, selected from the class  consisting of liquid or solid paraffinic compounds having a  linear or branched chain, comprising from 2 to 500 carbon  atoms, optionally containing one or more polar functional  groups, which is employed in the pure state or in solution in  hydrocarbon solvents, as the rate of 0. 01-5% by weight referÂ­ red to the total of the mix.

<DESCRIPTION>
"process for preparing homogeneous compositions of ole finic polymers in the form of granules and of various additives" this invention relates to compositions containing additiv es, obtained from polyolefins in the form of freeflowing particles (flakes) and to the process for preparing same. for preparing manufactured articles of polyolefins, pigmented, stabilized and generally containing compounds modifying the characteristics of the articles, the applicant and others have suggested processes based on the admixture of the polyolefins in powder with the additives, and on the successive transformation into granules by extrusion in the molten state. the granulated products are then utilized for being transformed into textile fibres, films, fibrillated films, fibrils, spun-bonded, by extrusion, and into plastic articles by extrusion, blow molding, coating, thermoforming-molding, calendering, roto-molding and the like. the processes based on the mixing of powdered polyolefins with additives and on the successive granulation involve complex technological operations, which are necessary when it is operated-with very fine powders. the polyolefins, however, can be prepared also in the farm of granules, the so-called flakes, according to what described by c.w. hock in polymer sci., 4, 3055 (1966), and in several patents in the name of the applicant and of others. such polymeric products are obtained directly in polymerization processes in suspension and consist of particles having an average size larger than 150 microns. these polyolefinic flakes can be directly transformed into additive-containing articles, after a simple mixing of the polyolefins with the additives, and excluding the granulation step, as this would cause non-homogeneous distrib tions of the additives in the polyolefins and difficulties in the transformation operations. the applicant has now found a process -. which is the object of the present invention - for preparing additional polyolefinic flakes, which consists in mixing the polyolefins in flakes with the additives, in the presence of a small amounts of a third component (a coupling agent) having the function of promoting a homogeneous distribution of the additives on the flakes' surfaces, binding then to the latter and making possible a direct transformation into manufactured articles, without any granulation step. the coupling agents suited to the use according to this invention are selected from the class consisting of paraffinic compounds, having a linear or branched chain, either liquid or solid, containing 2 to 500 carbon atoms, in particular vaseline oil, paraffin waxes, oligomers of propylene and ethylene, low molecular weight polypropylenesand the like, which are employed either in the pure state or in solution in hydrocarbon solvents. it has been also found - and this is another feature of the present invention - that the paraffin compounds may contain one or more polar functional groups. in such case the affinity between the coupling agent and the functional groups of the additives improves. paraffinic compounds containing polar groups particularly useful according to this invention are the ones comprised in the following general formula: r-x wherein x is a linear or branched alkyl radical, containing 12 to 30, preferably 12 to 18, carbon atoms, x may be:
