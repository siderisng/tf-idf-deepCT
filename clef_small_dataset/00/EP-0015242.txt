<ABSTRACT>
The jewelry piece protected by a hard metal shield may consist of a metal bracelet, composed of articulated elements to each other.In this case, each of these elements comprises a body 61 in machinable material, such as the stainless steel, and a wafer 64 made of sintered hard metal, which is attached to the body 61 by pads 65 welded against the lapel of the wafer.64 and from the body 61. The upper face of the elements of the bracelet is thus protected against the damage that can result from the clashes of the bracelet against foreign objects.As this face of the elements of Bra Celete is virtually the only one of the latter who, to wear, or visible, the bracelet will normally keep its initial appearance throughout the time it will be worn.
