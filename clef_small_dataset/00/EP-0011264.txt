<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a monitor system and method for  monitoring the occurrence of events in a cyclical process.   whether the successive events occur at their proper positions  within the process, position meaning, for example, a physical  location and/or a position in time, is accurately monitored,  and the process is stopped and a warning issued when an  event is missed.  monitoring can be restarted at a point of  interruption with resumption of correct checking for succesÂ­ sive events.  moreover, if an event is missed, the process and  monitoring may be restarted and the missed event selectively  automatically deleted from the list of sequential events for  which the monitor system looks.  the invention is employed,  for example, in connection with a conveyor belt system to  detect rips in the belt.
