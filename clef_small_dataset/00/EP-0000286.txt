<ABSTRACT>
a method and an apparatus for continuously patterning  a photosensitive tape (1) or foil wherein a master pattern (8)  and the tape (1) or foil are synchronously rotated for continually  projecting a sequence of images representative of  the pattern onto the tape via the optical system (11).  the  optical system, comprising a plano-convex lens (111), a concave  spherical mirror (112), and a pair of right-angle prisms  (113, 114), is optically coupled between the master pattern  and the tape or foil for projecting an image of the pattern  onto the tape.  the optical system is such that the movement  of the image is in the same direction as the movement of the  tape.  the apparatus is such that patterning can take place  through projecting an image on one or on both sides of the  tape.  alternatively, projecting an image on one side of the  tape and contact printing of a pattern on the other side of the  tape is also made possible by the apparatus.
