<ABSTRACT>
the lighting device has a reflector (2) and a light source (4) preferably arranged in its inner focus, which produce outside the reflector, preferably in its outer focus, a relatively narrowly restricted light spot.  according to the invention, in order to change the brightness of the light spot, there is arranged in the immediate area of the lamp (4), between the latter (4) and the reflector (2), in the path of the rays of the light a diaphragm (9) at least partially screening off the rays.  the diaphragm is in addition arranged so as to be displaceable from the centre to the periphery of the reflector for the purpose of screening off the rays.  the lighting device is intended for medical, particularly for dental, purposes.  <image>
