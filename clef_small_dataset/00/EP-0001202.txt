<ABSTRACT>
In a device for removing silage from a silo, a machine-adjustable milling device is provided and provided by the milled silage-forwarding conveyor.To increase the sampling power and easier forwarding of the freeding silage, the milling device (35,36,37) extends over the entire width of the device reselling and is movable before its vertical end wall (10).The end wall (10) is formed in the middle region as a collecting shaft (11) with a conveyor (20) directed perpendicular to the terminal wall (10) directed therein.The milling device (35.36,37) is provided in front of the collecting shaft (11) with milling and scurulum blades (35) to which on both sides of the milling device (35,36,37) ge-aligned milling and conveying screws (36,37)Connect the milled silage in the direction of the milling and spinning blades (35).
