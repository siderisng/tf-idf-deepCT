<ABSTRACT>
a microcomputer based system which provides a  method of electrical harness fabrication and testing.  each  connector into which the harness will be wired is mounted  on a receptacle containing a multiplex transponder (12), a  plurality of which are in turn connected in parallel through a  common data ribbon cable (10) to a controlling computer  (11).  a video display (26) is provided for interaction between  an operator and the computer (11).  as each wire is connected  between the appropriate connector pins, the computer (11)  through the cable (10) and multiplex transponders (12),  measures the connection resistance.  error meassages and  wiring information are displayed.  each multiplex transpon­ der (12) comprises a plurality of analog multiplexer/demul­ tiplexer parts for connecting a common transmit data line in  the connecting cable (10) to any predetermined connector  pin, and for connecting any connector pin to the common  receive line of the connecting cable (10) to allow testing the  resistance between any electrical points.  as a system initial­ ization step, the computer automatically codes each multip­ lex transponder (12) with a unique address so that a plurality  of otherwise identical multiplex transponders on the form­ board may be indentified by the computer (11).
