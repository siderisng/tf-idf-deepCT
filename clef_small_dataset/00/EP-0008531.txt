<ABSTRACT>
a rotary machine includes a stator housing (10, 12) hav­ ing an inner surface (16) defining a stator chamber (18) and  inlet and outlet ports (36, 38).  a cylindrical rotor (20) is rotat­ ably mounted within the chamber and has a plurality of vanes  (22) slidably mounted therein and movable with the rotor with  their tip portions projecting outwardly towards the inner sur­ face (16) of the stator housing.  a cylindrical cam surface (28) is  provided at each end of the stator housing, substantially con­ centric with the inner surface (16) of the housing.  two cam  followers (30) are mounted on each of the vanes and contact  the cam surfaces.  a cam follower retaining means (32)  cooperating with each cam surface is freely rotatable with  respect to the associated cam surface and defines a substan­ tially cylindrical retaining surface (34) which is concentric with  the cam surface.  the cam followers (30) thus position the  vanes during rotation of the rotor.
