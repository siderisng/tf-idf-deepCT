<ABSTRACT>
a holder for the assembly of a conventional flame cutting  torch tip (14) which provides release of the tip, and can include  water cooling (42-44) of the tip during machine cutting opera­ tions.  although such tips often become fouled, the prior art  has not provided sufficiently quick release for replacement  purposes.  the tip is held in abutment against the torch by a  plurality of cam (48) actuated clamping followers (56) which  wedge against the shoulder (68) of the conventional flame  cutting tip when the holder is in a clamping position.  the cam  is operated by rotating a spring-biased (26) actuating  member, preferably a circumferential ring (22), the ring being  rotatable between a clamping position and a releasing posi­ tion, and normally being biased by said spring into the clamp­ ing position.
