<ABSTRACT>
The push-pull driver circuit comprises a charging circuit (48, 50) and a discharge circuit (52) which determine the signal level of its common output (Va) as a function of an input signal. This driver circuit is logically linked to corresponding other drivers by direct electrical connection of the outputs (Va). For this purpose, a locking circuit (58) controlled by a gear signal is connected to the charging circuit (58). This locking circuit limits the current through the charging circuit (48, 50) during the idle state of the circuit and prevents inadmissibly high currents when the output signal level is transmitted via a further, with its output directly to the output of the present push-pull driver, corresponding ge gerktakt driver is lowered over its unloading circuit. Connected via one of the locking circuit (58) Collection step (56) is achieved that at the beginning of a supporting process, a high current can flow through the charging circuit at a short time, so that high switching speed is achieved.
