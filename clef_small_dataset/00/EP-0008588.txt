<ABSTRACT>
process and apparatus for separating or enriching gaseous mixtures, in particular isotope mixtures, into fractions of different gravities, preferably for enriching u 235 using uranium hexafluoride, wherein the gaseous mixture is accelerated by a centrifuge in the radial direction and separated in the exit region at the rim of the centrifuge into two fractions, it being provided according to the invention that, in the exit region at the outer rim of the centrifuge, the gas mixture be set into a turbulent flow (10) within a boundary layer and the heavy components of the gas mixture, as a consequence of the interaction of the centrifugal forces created by the rotation of the centrifuge with the centrifugal forces which act within the turbulence balls, diffuse out of the boundary layer, and the light fraction of the mixture is discharged through outlet lines (4) from the boundary layer enriched with the light components.  <image>
