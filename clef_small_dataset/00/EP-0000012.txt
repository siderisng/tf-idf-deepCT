<ABSTRACT>
For relieving pumps and maintaining a minimum flow rate in partially or completely closed receipt lines, it is known to use pressure-controlled overflow valves. The invention is a bypass valve for pumps and heating systems with a control element, which has two different valve disks 6, 7 in the size, which are connected via a rod 2 and in which the valve disk and the connecting bar in the flow direction is movably mounted and the valve discs are infinitely controllable exclusively via the flow. The larger telier of the control may be formed as a driver disk 16, between the outer edge and the housing wall an annular flow cross-section is present. In a reduction of the amount of inclusion, in the bypass valve according to the invention, independently of the pressure is infinitely connected a portion of the flow rate or the entire flow rate of the suction line of the pump Wither.
