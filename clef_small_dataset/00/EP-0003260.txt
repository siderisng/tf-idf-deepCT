<ABSTRACT>
a digital-to-analog converter circuit suitable for implementation  as an integrated circuit in integrated-injection-  logic form, and a method for regulating the collector current  in a plurality of integrated-injection-logic transistors are  disclosed.  a plurality of switching transistors (25-29) are  connected to digital input terminals (20-23) and the currents  conducted by the plurality of switching transistors are  summed to yield an analog output current.  an injection bar  (35) shared by each of the switching transistors provides  drive current to the plurality of switching transistors.  the  injection bar is also shared by one or more reference  transistors (36-39), the current in which is determined by a  current source (51).  a feedback circuit (45) is used to regulate  the bias of the common injection bar such that the current  conducted by each switching device corresponds to the  current conducted by each reference device.
