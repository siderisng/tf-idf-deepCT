<ABSTRACT>
a cathode assembly for a plural cell electrolyzer is pro  vided which comprises a rigid cathode support joined to a  cathode by a first set of connecting members and to an anode  in an adjacent cell by a second set of connecting members.   the cathode support and first set of connectors enable the  cathode to maintain an essentially flat surface.  the support  and second set of connectors stabilize the cell frame and  enable the anode likewise to maintain a flat surface, thus, the  electrodes in a cell may be set accurately flat and parallel to  minimize the interelectrode gap and the cell voltage drop due  to the electrolyte path, and, consequently, to improve cell  efficiency.
