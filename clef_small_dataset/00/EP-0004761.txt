<ABSTRACT>
this invention relates to elbow crutches and provides a  crutch to enable a patient with leg disability to raise himself  from a sitting position to a standing position.  basically the  invention consists in an elbow crutch, the length of which is  adjustable under the control of a manually operable lever.  in  particular, the crutch comprises two telescopically arranged  tubular members and a spring urging one tubular member  outwardly with respect to the other.  a rock and pawl are  provided to prevent relative movement between the two  members, and the pawl is controlled by the manually  operable lever.  normally a patient will use a pair of crutches  in accordance with the invention, and will initially operate  the lever of each crutch to reduce the length of the crutch to  the minimum by pressing the crutch on the floor.  he can then  raise himself by supporting his weight on the two crutches  alternately and operating the control lever of the crutch  which is not supporting his weight to allow that crutch to  extend.
