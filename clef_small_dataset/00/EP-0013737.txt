<ABSTRACT>
In a multi-stage storage hierarchy for a DA ten processing system, an integrated control circuit from receiver / driver combinations (201, 203, 205), egg circuit (24) and an overflow buffer memory (29), an error correction circuit (33) and a DA tenregister ( 23) available. When writing from the channel (15) in the main memory (39) beyond a double-word limit beyond, it is first determined whether the address in question is to be written in the cache memory. In the case of a positive result, the data is mixed with the full side of data doubled words from the Ca che memory in the common data register, and then the updated mixed cache memory side is transmitted to the main memory (39). If the result is negative, the data is transmitted via the data region Ster (23) in the overflow buffer (29), after which the double words belonging to the partial description are brought to auxiliary memory from main memory (39) to mix with the double words in the overflow buffer (29) and back in The main memory (39) written to who the.
