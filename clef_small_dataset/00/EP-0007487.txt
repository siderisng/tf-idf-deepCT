<ABSTRACT>
A can with inside laminated fuselage is sealed by means of a deep-drawn membrane, wherein on the inside of the can-opening doses wan dung (50) between the lower inner edge of an over the opening edge (50a) of the can (50) surrounded overdec kungsteils (27) of the membrane and a diaphragm rack (23) which is also adhered to the canner wall (23) of the film part of the membrane overlapping with the canopion (50a), a uncovered and unharmed ring strip (62) of the lamination (61) of the canner wall remains. a preformed closure element for use in the can to be sealed, method for producing a predetermined breaking point in which a membrane is permanently deformed between two compared to the membrane hard press surfaces under pressure and a device for carrying out this method as well as finally a method and a device for Preparation of the sealed tin described above are also described.
