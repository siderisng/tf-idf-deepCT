<ABSTRACT>
in a combined ventilator an window with spring load­ ed arms for installation in the roof of a motor coach, a  panel (18) is mounted on angularly movable arms (28) so  that the panel (18) can be moved between a closed posi­ tion, opened positions in which either side of the panel  (18) or either and of the panel (18) is opened, and an open  position in which the panel (18) is parallel to and spaced  from its closed position.  the arms (28) are pivotally mount­ ed on the frame (10) at (38) and have detent means (40)  to hold them in their alternative positions.  the other ends  of the arms (28) are plvotally connected to brackets (46)  depending from the panel, the latter pivotal connections  being adapted to permit relative movement between the  arms (28) and the panel (18) additional to movement about  the respective axes of pivotal coupling.
