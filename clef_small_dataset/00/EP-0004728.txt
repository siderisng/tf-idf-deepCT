<ABSTRACT>
reduction of noise in an electrical, e. g.  television, signal  is achieved by comparing signals from successive scans to  produce a difference signal.  low amplitude differences are  assumed to represent noise and are attenuated.  differences  above a predetermined level are assumed to represent  movement and are not so attenuated.  the attenuation is  achieved by a multiplier (26) which receives as multiplier the  output of a non-linear transfer characteristic element (24).   the non-linear element receives the differences after rectification  (100) and after passing through a variable-gain  element (102).  the non-linear element (24) is such that above  a predetermined value a constant predetermined minimum  attenuation factor applies.  a noise measurement circuit (x)  measures the noise present in the difference signal and  controls the gain of the variable-gain element (102) accordingly.   several noise-measurement circuits may be provided,  a selected one of which is used in dependence upon the  magnitude of the input signal to the apparatus.
