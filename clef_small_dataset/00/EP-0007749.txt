<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a self-steering dolly that is rigidly  releasably connected to the rear of a forward vehicle, such as  a tractor-trailer combination, and supports the front end of a  towed rearward vehicle, such as a second or "pup" trailer so  that the vehicles are in tandem.  the wheels of the dolly are  mounted on respective king pins; are connected by a linkage  and are urged to the neutral or straight-ahead position by a  centering device.  the means for releasably connecting the  dolly and the forward vehicle comprise two transversely  extending headed pins on the dolly of the kind employed with  a fifth wheel connection engageable in respective releasable  spring latches on the frame of the forward vehicle.
