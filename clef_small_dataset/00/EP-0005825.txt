<ABSTRACT>
a mechanical energy conversion method and system for  the restoration of dissipated heat energy, contained in  natural or artificial water bodies at or near ambient temperatures,  to industrial process heat, mainly in the form of steam  up to 200°-400°c.  in at least one evaporation chamber  (15,22,29,36) the sensible heat contained in a water body is  concentrated as latent heat in low pressure water vapor  which is thermo-compressed by steam ejection (52,58,59,60)  to an intermediate pressure level (85), wherefrom mechanical  compression (88) takes over, generating highly superheated  output steam (95).  the ejection steam is not generated  in a boiler, but is continously regenerated by the compressor  (88) and routed back for repeated ejection.  the compressor  (88) is driven by a heat engine (90) whose reject heat is  collected and upgraded as well.  the output of heat energy is  essentially equal to the sum of the heating value of the fuel  consumed and the intake of latent heat and amounts thus to  substantially more than the heating value of the fuel alone.
