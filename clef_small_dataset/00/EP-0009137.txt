<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for protecting the discharged cleaning bodies (5) consisting of elastic-deformable material such as rubber or art fabric, from the coolant circuit of a heat exchanger, to score such cleaning bodies (5), which due to the abrasion no sufficient dimensions have more to clean the pipes of the heat exchanger. still for well-found cleansing body (5) - optionally with the precedement of which cleaning body (5a) replacing new purei agent bodies (5b) - via a feed device (50) to the cooling agent circuit in the manner recovered during the sorted air or in New cleaning bodies (5b) contained vessels from the sponge-like cleaning bodies (5) almost completely removed and the cleaning body (5) with cooling liquid is soaked to ensure a uniform distribution of the cleaning body (5) in the coolant and a floating or decrease of the REI Granting body (5) and thus to prevent uneven grooming of the heat exchanger tubes. The novel device allows deposition and optionally replacing no longer functional cleaning bodies (5) without interruption of the cooling circulation.
