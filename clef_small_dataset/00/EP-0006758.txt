<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for adding materials and method of control­ ling the addition of materials, especially powdered or gran­ ular materials, to a flowing stream (2), e. g.  of molten metal,  comprises a nozzle (7) for compressed gas, blowing the  additive into the stream and a detector (6) that detects the  stream and switches the flow of additive on and off accord­ ing to whether the stream is present or absent.  the detector  (6) is preferably of a non-contact type, sensing radiation  from the stream (2), preferably visible light.  the rate of  flow of additive can be adjustable.  there can be a failsafe  optical detector arrangement (27, 29) monitoring the flow  of additive and signalling an alarm if the flow fails or if the  nozzle (7) is blocked.  the timings of the start and end of  the flow in relation to the detection of the metal stream are  independently adjustable to ensure that the additive and  metal coincide.
