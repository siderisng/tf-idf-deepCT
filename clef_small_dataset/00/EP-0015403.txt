<ABSTRACT>
For etching, the silicon is exposed to a plasma whose generation is assumed by a gas mixture, which contains WelCne SF₆, Cl₂ and an inert gas. With the procedure, single and polycrystalline silicon can be selectively etched in the presence of materials common in the semiconductor technique. The selectivity is particularly good in the presence of SiO₂ and Si₃N₄, which are important as mask and insulating materials. If the silicon is removed by means of reactive ion etching, it can be not only selectively in the presence of other materials, wherein the Si / SiO₂- and the Si / Si₃N₄ etching voice ratio is> 30: 1 or> 24: 1, but also directed etching so that the generated recesses have lower right side walls and the etching mask does not protrude beyond the edge of the etched recesses. The method can be used in the production of very highly integrated switches with very small or narrow and nane with each other reliably components.
