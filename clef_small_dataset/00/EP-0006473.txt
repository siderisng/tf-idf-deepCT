<ABSTRACT>
this invention concerns a method for measuring the  gap (10) between the bottom surface (12) of a component  (14) and the top surface (16) of a substrate (18) on which  the component is mounted.  the gap (10) between a component (14) and its as­ sociated substrate (18) is measured by casting shadow  edge (26) in a spot of light (28) directly below and edge  (29) of the component (14).  a viewing means (32) is fixed  at a predetermined angle (34) to the vertical from the sub­ strate (18).  the viewing means reticle (35) is first adjusted  to coincide with either the shadow edge (26) of the com­ ponent (14) in the light spot (28) or the bottom edge (29)  of the component (14).  the distance (44) that the viewing  means (32) is moved horizontally from one edge to the  other is measured.  this measured horizontal distance (44)  forms one side of a right triangle, the other side of which  is the vertical distance (30) between the shadow edge (26)  in the light spot (28) on the substrate (18) and the bottom  edge (29) of the component (14).  the distance (30) can  be calculated from the measured length (44) and the angle  (34) which is the fixed angle the viewing means (32) makes  with the vertical from the substrate (18).
