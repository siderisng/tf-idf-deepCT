<ABSTRACT>
a photosensitive coloured glass exhibiting alterable  photo-anisotropic effects and having a body portion and an  integral hydrated surface layer, characterized in that the body  portion comprises, in mole percent on the oxide basis, from  70 to 82 % sio₂ from 10 to 17 % na₂o and/or k₂o from 5 to 15  % zno, from 0. 5 to 5 % a1₂o₃ and from 0. 1 to3 % c1, and the  surface layer, at least a portion of which exhibits photo­ dichroic and birefringent properties, has a thickness of from 1  to 500 microns, contains up to 10 %, by weight, h₂o, contains  ag-agc1-containing crystals and contains up to 25 %, by  weight, ag, the na⁺ and/or k⁺ content decreasing with  increasing ag⁺ content.  a process for the production of such a glass characterized  in that the anhydrous glass is contacted with an aqueous  ag⁺-containing solution having a ph of less than 2 at a temp­ erature in excess of 200°c and at a pressure in excess of 16  kg/sq. cm.  and the resulting hydrated surface layer contain­ ing ag-agc1 crystals is exposed to ultra-violet radiation, is  also disclosed.  such glasses may be used as optical information storage  media.  referring to accompanying figure 2, curve a represents  the general absorption spectrum of the solution ion-­ exchanged products according to the present invention while  curve b represents that of the products according to pub­ lished g. b.  patent application no.  2,006,748.
