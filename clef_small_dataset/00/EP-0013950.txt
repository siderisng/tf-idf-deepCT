<ABSTRACT>
a first connecting link (22) is jointed in a swivelling manner to a first coupling half (10) at (24).  a second connecting link (34) is jointed in a swivelling manner to a second coupling half (12) at (36).  a first double control lever (38) is connected via a first control lever (40) to the first coupling half (10) and via a second control lever (42) to the second coupling half (12) as well as via a third control lever (48) to the first connecting link (22) and via a fourth control lever (50) to the second connecting link (34).  a second double control lever (52) is arranged on the opposite side and is connected via a fifth control lever (54) to the first coupling half (10) and via a sixth control lever (56) to the second coupling half (12) as well as via a seventh control lever (62) to the first connecting link (22) and via an eighth control lever (64) to the second connecting link (34).  <image>
