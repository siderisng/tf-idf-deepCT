<ABSTRACT>
compounds of the formula (i):    characterised in that   n is 1 to 5;   l is co₂r wherein r is hydrogen or co₂r is an ester  group in which r contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or  ch₂cor₁ wherein r₁ is c₁₋₄ alkyl;   y is -ch₂ch₂-, -ch=ch- or -c≡c-;   r₂ is hydrogen or c₁₋₄ alkyl;   r₄ is hydrogen or c₁₋₉ alkyl, c₃₋₈ cycloalkyl, c₃₋₈  cycloalkyl-c₁₋₆ alkyl; or   r₂ and r₄ taken with the carbon atom to which they  are joined represent a c₅₋₈ cycloalkyl group;   r₅ is nr₆r₇ wherein r₆ and r₇ independently are  hydrogen, c₁₋₄ alkyl, phenyl c₁₋₄ alkyl or nr₆r₇ is a 3 to 7  membered heterocyclic group containing only one hetero  atom; hydrogen, c₁₋₄ alkyl or c₁₋₄ alkyl substituted by an  oh, c₁₋₄ alkoxy, cn, halogen or nr₆r₇ group as defined  above, or by one or two co₂a groups in which a is hydrogen  or a group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms; and r₈  and r₉ independently are hydrogen, c₁₋₄ alkyl or together  with the carbon atom to which they are joined are a c₃₋₆  cycloalkyl group; and salts thereof, having activities similar  to but more selective than those of natural prostaglandins,  a process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compo­ sitions containing them.
