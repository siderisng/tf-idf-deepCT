<ABSTRACT>
a homing system guides a missile (10) towards a  metal target.  the missile is provided with a radar unit  (12) to transmit a radar signal of predetermined frequency,  and a tracking antenna (14) which scans a predetermined  search pattern to receive a reflected radar signal from  the target.  missile guidance and control means (51)  respond to error signals to correct the flight path of the  missile.  the system includes a local oscillator (68)  connected to a multiplier (70) for generating fundamental  and harmonic reference frequencies.  the received radar  signal is split into two channels each including a filter  (18, 20), a demodulator (22, 24) and a detector (34, 40).   the output of the detector in the harmonic frequency  channel is integrated (56) and supplied to a threshold  detector (58).  a switch (44) selectively connects the outÂ­ put of the fundamental and harmonic frequency detectors  to an error signal generating circuit for producing the  error signals.  the switch is actuated when the integrated  signal of the received harmonic frequency exceeds a  predetermined threshold.
