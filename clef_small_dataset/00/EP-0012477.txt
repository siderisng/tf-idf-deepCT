<ABSTRACT>
novel organotin compounds of the formula:    wherein q is 1 or 2; m is 1, 2 or 3; r₆ is an alkyl group hav­ ing from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having  from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group, an aralkyl group,  and alkaryl group having up to 30 carbon atoms, or a group  of the formula:    wherein r₇, r₈, r₉ and r₁₀ are each  independently an alkyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon  atoms, an oxygen-containing hydrocarbon group or a hy­ drogen atom, with the proviso that at least one of r₇ and  r₈ contains, adjacent to the hc grouping, a carbonyl group  which forms part of an acid group, an ester group, and acid  halide group, a ketone group or an aldehyde group; when  q = 1, r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄ and r₅, are, each independently, a  hydrogen atom, an alkyl or alkoxy group having from 1 to  14 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl or cycloalkoxy group, having  from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a nitro group or a halogen atom;  and when q = 2, m = 1, and the two structural units in the  para position are interlinked directly or by way of an oxygen  atom, a methylene group, an so₂ group or an isopropy­ lidene group, and r₁, r₂, r₄ and r₅ are each as defined  above, and a process for making the same.  the compounds may be formulated into stabilizer  compositions and used to stabilize polyvinyl chlorides and  polyvinylidene chloride against heat and light deterioration.   they may be used with 2,4,6-trisubstituted phenolic an­ tioxidants, and mono or di-alkyl or ester tin sulphides.
