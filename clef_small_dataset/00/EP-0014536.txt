<ABSTRACT>
to simplify the manipulation of a dinghy between water  and a storage location above high water mark, the dinghy is  constructed so as to be circular when viewed in plan and is  provided with pivotal means (14), such as a frusto-conical  buoyant body (30) having a bore (29), for receiving a handle  (22) whereby the dinghy can be rolled on its outer peripheral  edge after the manner of a wheel, whilst being pushed, pulled  and/or controlled by means of the handle.  in the illustrated  case, the handle is in the form of a pole inserted by one end  into the socket means 14 and retained therein by rollers (33),  on radial stubs (31), engaging with the undersurface of the  dinghy floor.  other means, such as a peg loaded by a leaf  spring engaging into a circumferential groove around the  pole, may be provided for retaining the pole.  accessories for  the dinghy, provisions and so on, can be taken along with the  dinghy by means of a receptacle (not illustrated) hung from  the handle (22).  an alternative form of handle arrangement may be in the  form of a yoke providing arms which extend along each side  of the dinghy and have respective pivot pegs engaging into  the socket means from opposite ends thereof.  such an  arrangement may be adapted for coupling to the towing hitch  of a vehicle.
