<ABSTRACT>
an apparatus for effecting intermingling of individual  filaments in a running yarn by the action of two or more fluid  jets comprises a chamber (5) extending longitudinally  through a body shell (2), the chamber being defined by a  horizontal planar first wall portion (6) and a bent or curved  second wall portion (7) which is symmetrical about a vertical  plane extending longitudinally through the middle of the first  wall portion.  fluid jet nozzles (9a,9b) positioned symmetri­ cally in the second wall portion provide air jets which com­ bine as a compound jet which forces a yarn down towards  the first wall portion (6), causing intermingling of the fila­ ments.  because of the symmetry of the chamber and air jets  continuous unidirectional rotation of the yarn is minimised  so that a high degree of uniform intermingling is achieved  for a minimal air flow.  the apparatus can be an assembly of  three wall pieces, (2a, 2b, 2c), the first wall portion (6) of the  chamber being a ceramic surface to resist abrasion by the  yarn and airflows, and a longitudinal slit (13) can provided  to facilitate introduction and removal of the yarn.
