<ABSTRACT>
an electrically controlled apparatus for studying the  phenomena of hemocoagulation and aggregation of the  platelets is described which permits to study both  phenomena and which permits to carry out the analysis of  hemocoagulation or the analysis of the aggregation of the  platelets.  the apparatus comprises: a) means (13) for contain­ ing a sample of blood and means (4) for stirring the sample of  blood; b) detecting means (1,2) for detecting the opacity of the  blood and for detecting the variations in the opacity of the  blood and converting said variations into electrical impulses;  c) means (5,7,8,9) for elaborating and decodifying said electri­ cal impulses and for measuring predetermined times to  obtain specific values; d) means (11,12) for conversion of the  said values into perceptible numerical or alphanumerical  signals or in the forma of graphs; and e) control means (6) and  programming means (5) to utilize the apparatus for carrying  out the operations of hemocoagulation and aggregation of  platelets.  futher is described a method of studying the  phenomenon of hemocoagulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
apparatus for the study of the phenomena of hemocoagulatic,n and aggregation of platelets. the invention relates to apparatuses used for studyng t phenomenon of coagulation of blood and aggregation of blood platelets. it is well known that several types of apparatuses are used in the art suitable to analyze the phenomena of blood coagu lation and aggregation of blood platelets. in particular two types of apparatuses are being used for the analysis of these two phenomena: for the blood coagulation essentially two types of appara ses are used in order to detect the progress: : - a first apparatus is of electro-mechanical type and in based on the fact that the plasma, while it is coagulated, blocks the regular agitation of a magnetic ball and the lat ter, at the time of the blocking, causes a determination of the time wich as gone by since the @ start of the phenomenon of coagulation of blood; ; - a second apparatus is of the electro-optical type and is based upon the absorption of light which increases gradually at the same time that the coagulation proceeds so that in addition to a pre-est.abl.ished minimum threshold, it is te etablish the periods of time required for the 4 3 r, 4 for the aggregation there are used instruments which give electro-optical measures of the light absorption caused-by the platelets being aggregated and by platelets which are not aggregated as a function of the percentage of the aggre gation. one drawback of these of these apparatuses resides in the fact that they give the two values separately and therefore the analyses must be carried out with two different appara tuses with the result that errors are likely to occur. the object of the present invention is to provide a single apparatus which permits to carry out two analyses so that it permits to achieve: - a substantial. saving in the space being used; - a substantial saving in the amount of time being required; - a reduction in the possibility of errors being caused by the exchange of the samples because no transfer of samples is required. another drawback of the apparatuses known in the art rela tes to the analysis of the phenomenon of coagulation of blood and specifically resides in the fact that there is detected an increase in the opacity while the thresholds of opacity in percent remain fixed, more or less, the latter blocking the timer from the start of the phenomenon. the result is that there is no uniformity in the detection with respect to a minimum or a maximum relative to the optical opacity manifested during the phenomenon. further, due to the fact that the percent thresholds of a pre-established opacity remain fixed since the start of the analysis, some drawbacks may arise as a function of the intrinsic opacity @@@@ @@@@@ @@@@@ed, w@ lot @@erlnsi@ sp@@ity m@ pary from individua.l to individual. i-onter object of the present invention more specifically is to eliminate the drawbacks mentionad hereinabove.
