<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides the compound of the  formula (ii):    and esters thereof.  these compounds are β-lactamase  inhibitors and antibacterial agents.  pharmaceutical composi­ tions containing them are described.  a process for the prep­ aration of a compound of the formula (ii) comprises the cataly­ tic hydrogenation of e. g.  a compound of the formula (v):    or a hydrogenolysable ester thereof, wherein r¹ is isopropyl  or isopropylene, and r³ and r⁴ together represents a  butadiene moiety.

<DESCRIPTION>
clavulanic acid derivatives, a process for their preparation and their use the present invention relates to ss-lactam antibacterial agents, to the process for their preparation and to compositions containing them. british patent application no. 16764/77 (see also u.s. serial no. 895441, belgian patent no. 187034 and west german offenlegungsschrift no. p2817085.6) discloses inter alia the compounds of the formula (i): emi1.1 and esters thereof wherein x1 is hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms, a hydroxy alkyl group of up to 5 carbon toms or an optionally substituted phenyl group. such compounds were described.as antibacterial agents and b-lactamase inhibitors. it has now been discovered that a crystalline. secondary amine can be prepared that is a ss-lactamase inhibitor that enhances the effectiveness of penicillins or cephalosporins and which also has antibacterial properties in its own right and which is advantageously water soluble. the present invention provides the compound of the formula (ii): emi2.1 the compound of the formula (ii) per se exists in the form of a zwitterion, that is it may be represented as shown in formula (iia): emi2.2 this zwitterionic compound is favoured in view of its crystalline form, stability and greater solubility than previously prepared ss-lactamase inhibitory amines such as those within the formula (i). as has been previously indicated we prefer to prepare and use the crystalline zwitterionic compound of formula (ii). however, esters of the compound of the formula (ii) also form part of this invention, for example as the free base or as the acid addition salt since such compounds may also be used to enhance the effectiveness of penicillins or cephalosporins. certain suitable esters of the compounds of the formula (ii) - include those of the formula (iii) and (iv): emi3.1 wherein a1 is an alkyl group of 1-6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by an alkoxyl or acyloxyl group of 1-7 carbon atoms; a2 is an alkenyl or alkynyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms or is a phenyl group optionally substituted by a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkyl or alkoxyl of up to 4 carbon atoms; and a3 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms or a phenyl group optionally substituted by a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkyl or alkoxyl of up to 4 carbon atoms. suitable esters of the compound of the formula (ii) include the methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, allyl, ch2-c=ch, methoxymethyl, acetoxymethyl, propionoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, methoxycarbonyl- oxyethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl, dimethoxyphthalidyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl, ethoxybenzyl, nitrobenzyl, chlorobenzyl or the like ester such as the 2-methylallyl ester. certain favoured groups a1 include the methyl, methoxymethyl, acetoxymethyl, acetoxyethyl, phthalidyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, a-ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and the like groups. certain favoured groups a2 include the phenyl and 4-methoxyphenyl groups. a particularly favoured moiety a3 is the hydrogen atom. certain other favoured values for a1 include those of the sub-formulae (c), (d) and (e): -cha5-0a6 (c) -cha5-coa6 (d) -cha5-c02a6 (e) wherein a5 is a hydrogen atom or a
