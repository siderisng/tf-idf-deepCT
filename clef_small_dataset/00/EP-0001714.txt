<ABSTRACT>
control apparatus for a semi-conductor laser  device.  apparatus for controlling the emission  wavelength and power of a semi-conductor laser device in  which the laser driver (5) is connected in a feedback loop  comprising a beam-splitter (6), a photodiode (8) and an amplifier  (19), which loop controls the driver (5) to maintain the  intensity of the laser emission constant.  the emission is also  sampled by a beam-splitter (7) and photodiode (9), which is  made frequency-dependent by a filter (10) interposed in the  path of the beam.  the outputs of the matched photodiodes (8)  and (9) are fed via amplifiers (11) and (13) to the positive and  negative inputs of a subtractor amplifier (12), the output of  which is therefore dependent only upon the emission  wavelength.  this output is fed as negative feedback to an  amplifier (15) for controlling an operating parameter (such as  the temperature) of the laser (1) to maintain the wavelength  constant.
