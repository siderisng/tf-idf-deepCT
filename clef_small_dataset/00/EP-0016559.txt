<DESCRIPTION>
an electrical generating apparatus and method the present invention relates to an electrical generating apparatus and method for obtaining an electrical supply from the output of g polyphase alternator, driven by an internal combustion engine. it is often desirable to run mains voltage appliances such as power tools or powerful lighting when a mains volts age supply is not available, e.g. in cars or boats or on building sites invariably, unless a mains generator is available which is costly, and bulky the only electrical supply present is of a low voltage, e.g. the 6, 12 or 24 volt electrics of motor vehicles such as cars, boats or building equipment such as cranes compressors or bulldozers it has been attempted to provide a system for obtaining a mains voltage supply from 12 volt lead acid batteries by inverting the dc voltage to provide 12 volts ac and then transforming this ac voltage to mains voltage, but only low power consuming mains voltage appliances can be run in this manner unless expensive circuitry is used. furthermore the inverter circuit is easily damaged if it is attempted tu run too high a power consuming appliance or if a short circuit occurs. accordingly the addition of protective circuits are necessary which adds considerably it is also known to use a rotary converter for obtain- to cost. inn a clams voltage supply from a 12 volt battery but it is not an efficient system. in both these known systems, the running of mains appliances off 12 vell batteries soon discharges the batteries, and the batteries must be continually charged e.g. by the alternator of a car, boat or building equipment engine, if any lower power consuming mains appliances are to be run for any length of time. furthermore, the amount of power available for the appliance is extremely low compared to the power provided by the alternator i.e. such systems are inefficient. the present invention seeks to provide an apparatus and method for obtaining an electrical # supply which is particularly suitable for enabling the running of high power consuming mains voltage appliances than has previously been possible from low voltage supplying alternators driven by internal combustion engines such as are present in land/vehicles, boats and building equipment. indeed the present invention is useful where a nigh voltage source is required in the absence of a mains voltage supply, and the only electrical source available is from an alternator driven by an internal combustion engine. in general most alternators driven by internal combust- ion engines are of the polyphase type e.g. three phases. the relatively high power output obtained with the present invention compared azith the known systems discussed above is obtained by the particular use of all the phases o-fÂ¯the alternator. the present invention provides an electrical generating apparatus comprising 2 polyphase alternator, an internal combustion engine connected to drive said alternator, a step up polyphase transformer having its number of phases corresponding to the number of phases of the alternat-or -and each phase
