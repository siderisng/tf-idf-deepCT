<ABSTRACT>
an improved ceramic capacitive pressure sensor adaptable  for use in automobiles is disclosed.  the pressure sensor  comprises a thin flexible diaphragm disc 22 having a  capacitor electrode 24 deposited on it.  a thick cylindrical  base substrate 10 has a top surface 11 with a second  capacitor electrode 17 deposited thereon and the diaphragm  is bonded to the top surface of the base substrate by an  annular glass ring 15 such that the first and second  electrodes (17, 24) are separated from each other and face  each other directly across an air gap 31.  the diaphragm, the  top surface of the base substrate and the annular glass ring  form an internal cavity 31 in which a reference vacuum is  stored.  in response to pressure changes outside of this  cavity, the diaphragm will flex and thereby change the  capacitance created by the first and second electrodes.  at  least one channel portion 20 is provided in the base substrate  top surface which opens into the cavity storing the reference  vacuum.  this improves the electrical and mechanical characteristics  of the pressure sensor.  the diaphragm electrode 24  is substantially larger than the base electrode 17 and extends  substantially over all of the central portion of the diaphragm  within the glass annular ring and in this manner the  electrode acts as a shield against conductive elements which  are exterior to the internal cavity and are adjacent to the thin  diaphragm.
