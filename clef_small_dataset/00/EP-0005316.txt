<ABSTRACT>
apparatus and process for writing video information  in the form of a frequency-modulated signal upon a disc  member and for retrieving the recorded information.  the  disc member (10) formed by the writing apparatus is also  described.  the apparatus includes a laser (30) as a source  of write light beam (29) and a write optical system for  directing the focused beam to a moving disc member.  the  member comprises a substrate carrying a light responsive  coating (26) at least on one surface.  the write optical  system includes an optical modulator (44) that charges the  intensity of the write laser beam with respect to a predetermined  threshold intensity sufficient to form a first type  of indicia in the coating and a feedback apparatus that  stabilises the operating level of said modulator.  the read optical system includes a light sensing circuit  (158) for changing the intensity-modulated reflected-light  beam to a corresponding electrical signal.  a triangular frequency modulator (figure 14c) for  driving a pockels cell (68), for obtaining a sinusoidal-shaped  light-modulation output signal from the linear  polariser (70) and a bias circuit (264) employed for removing  the second harmonic intermodulation distortion of  the modulated write beam, are described.
