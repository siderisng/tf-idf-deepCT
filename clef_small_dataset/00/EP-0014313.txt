<ABSTRACT>
a transaction execution system is provided in which key  initiated transaction requests at a terminal remote from and in  communication with a host data processing system are processed  at the terminal under the selective control of the host.   each active transaction key at the terminal keyboard is  assigned one of three different states by a financial institution  table 100.  the table 100 provides keyboard customization by  selecting one of a plurality of different groups of key states for  the different keys arrived at by combining the key states in a  custom key set table 106 with the states in a base key set table  104 in response to information from a credit card entered by a  consumer.  transactions requested by keys assigned an  active, standard state are processed at the terminal without  further data input being required of the consumer.  transactions  requested by keys having an active, data entry state are  also handled within the terminal and with the additional consumer  entered data required to complete the transaction  being requested by and received by the terminal using sets of  messages previously stored in the terminal by the host data  processing system.  transactions designated by an interactive  key state take place within and involve interactive communication  between both the terminal and the host, enabling the  responses and other communications generated by the host  in connection with a transaction for a particular customer to  be customized and providing for greater and more varied  transactions including such things as bill paying in which  funds are transferred between accounts in the host.  message  storage within the terminal and communication of messages  to the terminal from the host are greatly simplified by storage  of segments of messages at the terminal.  frequently repeated  phrases can then be incorporated into a message as it is  readied for display at the terminal by storing the phrases as  segments and thereafter simply identifying them in message  definitions communicated to the terminal from the host or  stored at the terminal.
