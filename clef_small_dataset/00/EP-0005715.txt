<ABSTRACT>
A transfer drum for beautifully and oppression machines has two opposite arc bearing surfaces (15), which are formed by two comb-like interlocking groups of sheet carriers (8, 11).At one of the two sheet carrier groups (8, 11) of each sheet bearing surface (15), a device (9) for detecting the arc front edge is provided.The two a sheet bearing surface (8, 11) forming sheet carrier groups are adjustable to each other around the rotary matter of the transfer drum.Furthermore, each sheet carrier (8, 11) is firmly connected to a diametrically opposite arc carrier of the other arc gauge to a unit and arranged on the axis (3) of the transfer drum.At least one of the two arc carrier units is mounted radially adjustable on the axis of the transfer drum.This adjustability allows the troubleshooting and form errors of the transfer drum.
