<DESCRIPTION>
esters of 1,1,2-triphenyalkene derivatives this invention relates to triphenylalkene derivatives which possess anti-oestrogenic activity. according to the invention there is provided an alkene derivative of the formula: emi1.1 wherein either r1 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl radical and r2 is a lower alkyl radical, or r1 and r2 are joined together with the adjacent nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic radical; n is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6; r3 is a halogen atom or a lower alkyl radical; r is a hydrogen or halogen atom, or a hydroxy or lower alkyl or lower alkoxy radical, or is the buta-l,5-dienyl radical such that together with the benzene ring it forms a naphthyl radical, or r4 has the formula -ocor5; and r5 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an alkoxyalkyl radical of 2 to 10 carbon atoms, or r5 has the formula emi1.2 wherein m is o, 1, 2, 3 or 4,wherein r is a hydrogen or halogen atom or a cyano, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy radical a:ld wherein p is 1, 2 or 3; cr r5 has the formula -nnr7, wherein r7 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms or r7 has the formula emi2.1 wherein m, p and r6 have the meanings stated above; or a pharmaceutically-acceptable acid-addition salt thereof. it is clear that a compound of the invention can exist in the form of a cis or a trans isomer in which the designation cis or trans refers te the relative positions of the acyloxyphenyl radical, and the phenyl radical bearing the group r , about the double bond. the cis and trans isomers may be distinguished by the magnetic resonance signals of the protons in the -och2 - group of the -o(ch2)nnrlr2 side-chain, the signals of these protons in the cis isomers occurring at lower field than of those in the corresponding trans isomers. this invention includes both cis and trans isomers and mixtures thereof which possess the above properties, it being a matter of common general knowledge how to separate cis and trans isomers and how to determine their anti-oestro genic and oestrogenic activity. a particularly suitable value for r1 r2 r3 r4 or r6 when it is a lower alkyl radical is, for example, an alkyl radical of 1-4 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or a butyl radical. a particularly suitable value for r1 and r2 when they are joined together with the adjacent nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic radical is, for example, a 5- or 6 membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic radical optionally including an oxygen or sulphur atom as a second hetero-atom, for example a pyrrolidino, piperidino or morpholino radical. a particularly suitable value for r5, r4 or r6 when it is a halogen atom is, for example, a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom. a particularly suitable value for r or when it is a lower alkoxy radical is, for example, an alkoxy radical of 1-4 carbon atoms,
