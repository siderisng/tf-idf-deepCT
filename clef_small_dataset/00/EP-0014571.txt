<DESCRIPTION>
"stair mat" @his invention relates to a stair mat adapted to be installed cn stairs, especially stairs arranged to the inside ± the building in general, stair nosings are installed on the edge of steps for the purpose of preventing a person from missing iii.s footing on the stairs and of obviating the danger of the missed footing, and carpeting is applied to the stairs for the purpose. nf giving an ornamentality, further of giving a sound absorption, a buffer action, a thermal insulation and a flexibility, conventionally the carpeting is fixed by stair rods. however, with stair no sings, the sound absorption, the thermal insulation and the flexibility are lacking on the steps and the buffer action is insufficient, and with continuous stair carpets, the carpets are worn away at the edge of the steps. suc carpets should be changed then dirty, which is uneconomical. there is a tendency to connect the stair nosing and the narrow carpet in one united body1 or to combine stair nosing and the narrow carpet separately installed on the steps. however, the former must be uneconomically changed iicn the stair nosing or the carpet is worn away or damaged and changing work is difficult, the latter is not fixed firmly and its installing work is difficult; furthermore it brings into existence undesirable dispersion, for it may be insqalled in a manner that the stair nosing and the carpet are put side by side or one above the other by driving in of nails or screwing. one object of the present invention is to provide a stair mat which can alleviate the problem of missed footing on the stairs and to obviate the danger of missed footing, by covering the edge of the stair, and which gives effects of nonskid and cushioning, and further gives sound absorption thermal insulation, flexibility and ornamentality. another object of the present invention is to provide a stair mat in which, whilst comprising an edge cover and a tread mat, the tread mat can be easily assembled to and removed from the edge cover, and either of the edge cover or the tread mat can be easily changed for another according to an extent of the abrasion, the damage and the corruption. according to the invention there is provided a stair mat comprsing: an edge cover of flexible synthetic resin or rubber, having an edge bead cushion adapted to be secured onto the forward edge of the tread of a step and a tread-side tongue integrally and horizontally extending from the rear portion of the edge bead cushion and adapted to be secured onto the tread of the step; a tread mat adapted to be secured onto the tread of the step, being placed on the tread-side tongue at the front edge thereof, and a connecting means connecting the front edge of the tread mat removably with the tread-side tongue of the edge cover. as mentioned above, the stair mat is adapted on the tread of the step to
