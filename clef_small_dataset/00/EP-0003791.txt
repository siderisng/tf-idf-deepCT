<ABSTRACT>
a lever device for clamping the ski boot in the front bracket  of the attack or connection for a long distance ski, wherein  the stakes (21) set in the bracket for the front attack or connection  of the boot to the ski are secured on an upper cross piece  of the attack or connection clamping lever (12), and particularly  descend from top to bottom in the lever closing movement  and penetrate into the holes (22) suitably arranged in the  upper layer of the front extension (18) of the long distance  boot sole (19), so that in the final stride movement, when the  sole deflects, the stakes (21) are clamped in the holes (22) of  the upper layer compressed by the sole, assuring a more  intimate coupling between the boot toe and ski.
