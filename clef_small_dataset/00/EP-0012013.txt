<ABSTRACT>
a planting tray comprises a flat imperforate base 10 on an  upper surface 11 of which a cell structure 12 rests, the cell  structure being for filling with a planting medium, such as  compost.  the cell structure 12 is composed of a plurality of  generally planar divider members 13 detachably connected  together by means of slots 14 therein, each slot being cham­ fered where it opens onto an edge of the respective divider  member 13 to permit the easy insertion of another divider  member therein.  seedlings or plants which have been grown  in the individual cells of the cell structure 12 are prepared for  transplating by the simple expedient of detaching the divider  members 13 from one another by moving each divider  member in its respective general plane, thereby leaving the  individual root balls intact on the base 10.  damage to the root  balls is thus obviated, and the planting tray can therefore be  used to grow plants which cannot normally be transplanted  due to the danger of root damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a planting tray principally for use as a seed tray. according to the present invention, there is provided a planting tray comprising a flat, substantially impel forate base having at least one open edge, and a cell structure composed of a plurality of mutually intersecting, generally planar divider members which are detachably connectible together in such a manner that, when the cell structure is rested on the base and is filled with planting medium in use, the divider members can be detached from one another by movement in their respective general planes without substantial disturbance of the planting medium. an embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way- of examplevwith reference to the accompanying drawing, which is an exploded perspective view of a seed tray according to the present invention. referring to the drawing, the illustrated seed tray comprises a rigid imperforate base 10 whose upper surface 11 is flat and substantially free from surface blemishes, the base being square or rectangular and having all four of its edges open. restable on the upper surface 11 is a cell structure 12 which is composed of a plurality (in this case, twelve) of generally planar divider members 13. the cell structure 12 defines a 5 x 5 grid of individual planting cells in each of which one or more seeds, seedlings,etc can be.planted. the divider members 13 are slotted so as to enable them to be detachably connected together. in fact, each divider member 13 has six equi-spaced slots 14 therein which open onto a common edge of the divider member. the cell structure is assembled in use by placing six of the divider members in laterally spaced, parallel relation with their slots opening upwardly, by orienting the remaining six divider members at right angles to the "slot up" divider members with the slots therein opening downwardly, and by engaging the slots in each of the "slot dowaiç divider members with respective slots in all six of the nslot up" divider members. to facilitate such engagement, the slots are chamfered or tapered where they open out onto the edge of the respective divider member. this tapering also facilitates drainage and watering (by submersion) so that no drainage holes need be provided in the base 10. such holes are undesirable, since they may allow plant roots to grow therethrough and thus impede the subsequent removal of the root balls from the base. each divider member 13 has two holes 15 at either end thereof which enables it be hung up for storage. the base 10 and the divider members 13 are preferably made of plastics material, for example a medium impact styrene. in use, the assembled cell structure 12 is placed on the upper surface 11 of the base 10, and the cells therein are filled with planting medium (e.g. compost) up to the level of the upper edges of the divider members 13. seeds, seedlings or the like are then. sown or planted in

<CLAIMS>
claims:   1. a planting tray comprising a flat base and a cell structure on the base for filling with planting medium, characterised in that the base (10) is substantially imperforate and has at least one open edge, and the cell structure (12) is composed of a plurality of mutually intersecting, generally planar divider members (13) which are detachably connected together so that they can be detached from one another by movement in their respective general planes without substantial disturbance of the   plant    ing medium.    2. a planting tray as claimed in claim 1, wherein the divider members (13) are slotted to permit their detachable connection together.   3. a planting tray as claimed in claim 2, wherein the slots (14) in each divider member (13) open onto a common edge of the latter.   4. a planting tray as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein each slot (14) is chamfered where it.opens onto an edge of the respective divider member (13).   5. a planting tray as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the base (10) and the divider members (13) are made of a durable material, such as a plastics material.
