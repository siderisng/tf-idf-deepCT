<ABSTRACT>
a well screen element comprising in the walls of it three  holes (2) for connecting the elements each other, rings (3)  to provide the precise centering ans screen openings (1)  are in (v) shape with the wide end of them are directed  inside of the element and their numbers and height are  so adjusted to provide a larger filtration surface, and a well  casing pipe (10) of any length comprising, where it is con­ nected to the well screen elements, six connection bolts  (6), a guide bolt (4), guide openings (5), screen bottom  piece (9), three connecting rods on the outer periphery,  and having well screen elements are necessary numbers  at the locations under the ground depending the level(s)  of underground water.

<DESCRIPTION>
plastic well screen and its connection system this invention relates to a well screen and its connection system. in this invention the well screen made of plastic is used to filter the water in the wells and collect the ground water. connection system will facilitate the pipe connection and disconnection. known in the prior art in the deep wells and pipes made of steel, closed and screened are used. the weight of the steel pipes are however changeable depending on their diameter and length, still the density of 3 the pipes being 7,8 kg/dm3 creates problems in transport and their attachment. pipes are connected by welding, when it is required to disconnect it is necessary to cut the pipes from welded points. these processes are accomplished with a diesel generator set and it is time consuming. however, the wells opened by drilling rods are easily collapsible so attachment of the pipes must be carried out quickly. in the screened pipes, the screen openings are prepared either when material is flat or made up to pipe. the screen openings prepared on the flat plate will close at the inside and open at the outside while the production of pipe. in this way the opening will be wide at the outside and narrow inside. the openings prepared on pipe will have parallel two surfaces. on the other hand, the opening width will depend on the thickness of cutting tools and will have certain value. whichever production system of the above method is used, the sand particles coming with water will stick to the openings and in time will reduce the screening area and sometimes in sandy places will result in complete clogging of the openings. the mineral salts present in the water will also in time result in clogging of the openings. it is well known that that the iron material is effected by the acidic or basic soils. the acidic or basic media effected on iron material results in corrosion. on the other hand the pipe being in contact with water continuously at the inside certainly will result in corrosion. for this reason the working life of steel pipes are known to be lo to 15 years. at the end of this life or the collapse of the well for the same reason, it is necessary to open a new well and equip it with pipe. in the steel pipes, the total screen area proportion to total pipe surface area is generally remains to a low value, such as at 20%. the closed pipes or well screened pipes made of plastic are light because of the low density and it is easy to transport and attach to each other. as seen in the figure 2, the connection of the pipes are realised by peripherical 6 bolts. these bolts are thick and specially threaded and conical. the connection of the pipes are realised with the easy advance of the bolts into the holes on the pipes. to disconnect the pipes, the bolts

claims: 1. a well screen element comprising in the walls of it three holes for connecting the elements each other, rings to provide the precise centering and screen openings characterized in that the openings are in the v shape with the wide end of them directed inside of the element and in that their numbers and height are so adjusted to provide a larger filtration surface.   2. a well casing pipe of any length comprising, where it is in connection to the well screen elements of claim 1, six connection bolts, a guide bolt, guide openings, screen bottom piece, three connecting rods on the outer periphery, and having well screen elements of claim 1 in necessary numbers at the locations under the ground depending the level(s) of underground water.
