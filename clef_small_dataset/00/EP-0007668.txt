<ABSTRACT>
a group of infra-red radiation detector elements are  manufactured from a body (21) of infra-red sensitive materials  on an insulating substrate (22) using two masking steps which  do not require critical alignment eeven with close spacing  between the elements.  a first masking layer (24; see figure  10) e. g.  of photoresist is formed on the upper surface of at  least the body (21) to determine by a lift-off technique a metal­ lization pattern (35, 36;) on the body (21) and the  substrate (22).  a second masking layer (44) e. g.  of photoresist  is then provided to determine by ion-bombardment through  windows (45) of this layer (44) the desired pattern of elements  and their electrodes.  the ion-bombardment permits removal  of exposed areas of not just the body (21) and metallization  pattern (35, 36) but also of a passivating layer on the body  surfaces; a closely spaced group of elements and their elec­ trodes can be obtained because the ion-bombardment results  in steep sides without significant undercutting.  it is suggested that figure 14 should accompany the abs­ tract when published.
