<ABSTRACT>
raw water is fed to a first column containing a weak acid  cation exchange resin in hydrogen form whore alkalinity caus­ ing ions and hardness causing ions to the extent of alkalinity  are converted to carbonic acid.  the carbonic acid, which hyd­ rolyzes to dissolved carbon dioxide, is stripped from the water  in a decarbonation unit by passing air countercurrent to the  flow of water through the unit.  the water is then fed to a  second column containing a weak acid cation exchange resin  in sodium form which removes residual hardness causing  ions along with neutralization of any mineral acids or residual  dissolved carbon dioxide.  both resins are substantially com­ pletely regenerated upon exhaustion to provide a process in  which the maximum capacities of the resins are utilized, and  the process can be carried out with a minimum of monitoring  and control.
