<ABSTRACT>
the velocity measuring correlation sonar disclosed  employs a planar array of receiving transducers (33 to  36) spaced in the directions (vx and vy) along which  velocity components parallel to the plane of the array are  to be measured, and includes means (31) for transmitting,  a series of two or more identical pulses which are separat­ ed by a time interval selected in accordance with trans­ ducer separation and the estimated velocity components  so as to place the expected point of maximum correlation  of the echo return from one pulse with that from a  following pulse within the boundaries of a set of spatial  sample points representing relative spacings between  pairs of receiving transducers.  correlation measurements  are made (at 63) corresponding to these relative spacings  of the receiving transducers, with each such measurement  being treated as a sample of a space-time correlation  function of predetermined shape.  the location of the  peak of this function in each of the directions of interest  is estimated by curve fitting techniques, and yields the  velocity vector in that direction scaled by the inter-pulse  time interval.  the velocity component normal to the plane  of the array may be derived by estimating the location of  the correlation peak as a function of time and/or phase,  using similar curve fitting techniques.
