<ABSTRACT>
a magnetic transducer head slider support assembly  comprises a one-piece arm (10) carrying at one end a one-­ piece flexure (26) for connection to the transducer head slider  (38).  the flexure (26) has two outer spaced apart resilient  fingers (30) parallel to the longitudinal axis of the arm (10) and  joined at their remote ends by a cross leg (34) which is less  flexible than the resilient fingers (30).  an inner central finger  (34) extends parallel to and between the two outer fingers  from an offset portion of the cross member.  the central finger  (34) and the tip (22) of the arm (10) engage one another  through a protruding contact (42).  the cross-leg (34) is offset  by an amount substantially equal to the height of the protrud­ ing contact.  the arm (10) is generally triangular and made of a  resilient material but it is stiffened by flanges (20) along all but  a portion of its length at the opposite end to that which carries  the flexure (26).
