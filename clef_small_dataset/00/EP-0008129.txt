<ABSTRACT>
For the storage of drums od. Like. If bearing housings (5) are preferably used, in the bore a rolling bearing (7) depending on the type of bearing, d. H. Whether it is the fixed or loose bearing, is fixed axially fixed or arranged axially displaceably. To provide a bearing housing which can be used without great change and effort, both for a fixed and a floating bearing, from outside the bearing housing (5) actuating means, such as screws (22), mounting rings or angular tabs in or on Bearing housing (5) provided, through which the holding means (11) for or the outer ring (9) of the rolling device (7) itself, even if necessary in the axial direction, are fixed bar. The creation of a fixed bearing unit is done, for example, in that the screw (22) is shifted so far into the bore (21) in the bearing housing (5) that her tapered tip engages in an annular groove on the jacket of the outer ring (9) of the bearing and this axial Fi x. If a floating bearing unit is to be created, then the screw (22) is turned back and a hazer between the screw head and outer surface of the bearing housing is intermediate.
