<ABSTRACT>
3-alkylxanthines characterized by the formula    wherein r¹ is n-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-pentyl,  2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, cyclop­ ropyl, cyclobuty, cyclopentyl of cyclohexylmethyl, and r² is  hydrogen or methyl, provided that r² is methyl when r¹ is  n-propyl, n-butyl or isobutyl, or a physiologically acceptable  salt thereof, for example the compound 3-cyclopetnyl-3,  7-dihydro-1h-purine-2, 6-dione, have activity against chronic  obstructive airway disease or cardiac disease.  these com­ pounds are produced by several methods, exemplified by the  following one: reacting a compound of the formula    with a compound of the formula   r²-x   wherein r¹ and r² have the definition given above and x is  -cooh, -conh₂ or -oc-o-co-r₂ and, if necessary, submitting  the obtained product to dehydration.  the starting compounds  wherein r¹ is n-pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, 2,2-­ dimethylpropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cy­ lohexylmethyl are not previously described in teh literature  they are prepared by reacting a compound of the formula  r¹nhconh₂ with cyanoacetic acid, cyclising the produced  1-cyanoycetyl-3-r¹urea with alkali, nitrosing the so produced  1-r¹-6-aminouracil with hno₂ and reducing the so produced  1-r¹-5-nitroso-6-aminouracil with h₂//pto₂.
