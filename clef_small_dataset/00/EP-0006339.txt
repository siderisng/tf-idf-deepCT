<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a multi-function end effector  (200) for performing operations on a tubesheet (28) of a  nuclear steam generator (20) to which hazardous environ­ ment limits human access.  a vertical member (202) is sup­ ported by the tubesheet through an attachment mecha­ nism (204), a body (92) and camlocks 112, 120.  the verti­ cal member has a horizontal table (208) which is capable  of positioning tools (234) in relation to the tubesheet and  capable of driving the tools.  the table comprises a center­ ing device (290) for positioning the tools in proper rela­ tion to the tubesheet the horizontal table has a crescent-­ shaped gear (222) which provides a receptacle to hold the  tools in place and prevent rotation and also provides rotary  motion of the tools.
