<ABSTRACT>
disclosed are novel 6-oxygenated-3,20-dioxo-pregnane  derivatives of the general formula i    and specified 1,2-dihydroderivatives thereof.     wherein z represents  specified acylgroups.  the other substituents of formula i include those commonly  met in known corticosteroids.  the novel compounds may be prepared by methods  known per se.  the 6-acyloxy compounds of formula i are  preferably prepared by subjecting a corresponding 6-oxo-compound  of formula ii, as herein defined, to esterification  conditions.  the 6-oxo-compounds of formula i are preferably  prepared by oxidation of the corresponding  6-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro compounds.  the novel compounds  exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and are therefore useful in  the treatment and control of inflammatory conditions.
