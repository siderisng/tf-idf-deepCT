<ABSTRACT>
an optical fibre is terminated by securing the fibre with  adhesive (41) in a ferrule (16) having a radially deformable  end portion (23) with a portion of the optical core (2) from  which the cladding (4) has been removed protruding out  from the end portion (23) and press fitting a rigid alignment  socket (33) having a concentric bore (37) in a transverse end  wall (36) onto the end portion (23) of the ferrule (16) with the  core (2) received in the bore (37) so that the core (2) is conÂ­ centric with the periphery of the end portion (23).  the  exposed portion of the core (2) is removed after the adhesive  (41) has set together with the alignment socket (33) and the  ferrule end portion (23) press fitted into a suitble bush also  receiving a similarly terminated fibre.
