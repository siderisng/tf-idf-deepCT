<ABSTRACT>
herbicidal suifonamides and the preparation and use  thereof, the sulfonamides having the general formula    wherein    or    r₂ and r₃ are independently hydrogen, fluorine, chlo­ rine, bromine, methyl, methoxy, nitro or trifluoromethyl;   w is oxygen or sulfur;   x is -nhch₃ or -n(ch₃)₂;   z is methyl or methoxy; and   a is  or n   or its agriculturally suitable salts provided that when r₂  is nitro or trifluoromethyl, r₃ cannot be nitro or trifluoro­ methyl.  the compounds can be formulated into compositions  for agricultural use by conventional means.  the compounds  are useful for the regulation of plant growth and as herbi­ cides, particularly for controlling volunteer corn in soybeans.   they can be prepared by reacting an appropriate 2-amino-­ heterocycle with an appropriately substituted sulfonyl iso­ cyanate or isothiocyanate.
