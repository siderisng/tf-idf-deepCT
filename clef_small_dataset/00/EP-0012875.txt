<ABSTRACT>
Non-ionic emulsifiers of the type of articles of alkylene oxides of hydroxyl, carboxyl or carbonamide group-containing compounds which are free of impurities caused by the production are obtained by releasing the reaction mixtures in organizi, with water non-miscible organic solutions in the middle, treatment with water, separating the aqueous layer and optionally isolation of the emulsifiers by removing the organic solvents.
