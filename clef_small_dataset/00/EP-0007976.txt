<ABSTRACT>
copolymers of poly-alpha substituted acrylonitrile, e. g. ,  methylacrylonitrile, manifest film forming properties, adhe­ sion to usual substrates, sensitivity to actinic radiation,  resolution, contrast, and other properties of significance  for fine line lithographic use.  contemplated use includes  fabrication of masks for manufacture of large scale integrat­ ed circuits.  stability to attack by ions and reactive chemicals,  as well as thermal stability, are sufficient to permit use in  direct processing of such circuits.  integrity of pattern fea­ tures may be further assured by post-development treat­ ment.  heating results in rearrangement to render the pat­ terned resist more stable under a variety dry processing  conditions.
