<ABSTRACT>
an intruder alarm apparatus for protecting a building or  a vehicle and consuming a minimal amount of energy when  in "watch" condition.  an acoustic transmitter t is placed  inside (or outside) a closed space s being supervised, an  acoustic receiver r is placed outside (or inside) the closed  space, and an amplifier a has its input connected to the  receiver output and its output connected to the transmitter  input.  if the integrity of the closed space is broken, if for  example the enclosed wall is breached at b then an acoustic  feedback loop is completed by a path being thus established  between transmitter and receiver, such that oscillation  occurs, and only now are substantial amounts of electrical  energy consumed.
