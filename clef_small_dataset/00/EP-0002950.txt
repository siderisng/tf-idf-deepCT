<ABSTRACT>
textile materials formed of polyester or nylon fibers  having improved durable soil release and moisture transport  characteristics are provided by application to the  textile material of at least about 0. 001 to about 10 weight  per cent of a water-soluble cellulose acetate polymeric  constituent having a degree of substitution of the acetyl  moiety of from about 0. 6 to about 0. 9, in water, and by  drying the wet textile material.  such a water-soluble  cellulose acetate polymeric constituent is represented by  the formula    wherein x is an integer of at least 50, n is an integer of from  about 2. 4 to about 2. 1, and the expression 3-n is the degree  of substitution of the acetyl moiety.  in the process for  producing same the water-soluble cellulose acetate polymeric  constituent can be applied to the fabric from an  aqueous pad bath containing the polymeric constituent,  by exhaustion techniques during the dyeing of the textile  material, or as an aqueous spray.
