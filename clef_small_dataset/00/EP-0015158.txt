<ABSTRACT>
in a serial printer of the type having a carriage continu­ ously moved along a printing line and supporting a type-­ member intermittently rotated for selecting the next character  being printed, a control unit is provided which performs an  algorithm for executing a forecast calculation of the residual  time missing in every moment to the type-member for posi­ tioning the character being printed.  the same control unit  calculates a correspondent speed of the carriage depending  on that residual time and on the position reached by the  carriage on the printing line.  the speed of the carriage is  thereby continuously controlled from the preceding to the  new printing position for causing the printing of the selected  character exactly on the printing position at the maximum  speed of the carriage consistent with a good print operation.
