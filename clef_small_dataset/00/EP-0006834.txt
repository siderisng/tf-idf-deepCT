<ABSTRACT>
chemical direct reclaiming of rubber by mixing pul­ verulent scrap rubber having a particle size of at most 1 mm,  preferably at most 0. 4 mm, with a reducing agent, an oxid­ zable iron metal chloride and at least one plasticizer.  the  mixture is agitated for a short time, at most 30 min.  and  normally at most 15 min. , in the solid phase in air at a tem­ perature of not more than 100°c, usually approximately  room temperature, in a powder mixer for direct degradation  of double bonds in the rubber.  the reducing agent is from  0. 2 to 1 weight %, preferably from 0. 2 to 0. 8 weight % of  phenyl hydrazine or from 0. 2 to 0. 8 weight % of diphenyl  guanidine.  the iron metal chloride is admixed in an amount  of from 0. 1 to 0. 4 weight % and is preferably ferrous chlor­ ide.  the plasticizer shall comprise at least one member  from the group tall oil pitch and dipentene, and this plasti­ cizer may optionally be used in mixture with some other  plasticizer, such as mineral process oil.  the total amount  of plasticizer is at most 17. 5 weight %.  the amount of a  plasticizer other than tall oil pitch and dipentene is at most  10 weight %.  the amount of dipentene is at most 5 weight  % and is from 0. 5 to 5 weight % if the dipentene is used as  the only plasticizer or is used in mixture with another plas­ ticizer.  the amount of tall oil pitch is at most 17. 5 weight %  and is from 7 to 17. 5 weight % if the tall oil pitch is used  as the only plasticizer or is used in mixture with a plasti­ cizer other than dipentene.  if tall oil pitch is used in mix­ ture with dipentene, the amount of tall oil pitch varies in  inverse proportion to the amount of dipentene and is from  8 to 16 weight % with dipentene amounts of from 5 to 0,5  weight %.  all of the percentages are calculated on the mix­ ture of pulverulent rubber scrap, reducing agent, iron metal  chloride and plasticizer.  without preceding refining, the reclaimed pulverulent  rubber with a low admixture percentage (for example about  6%) of raw rubber (natural rubber of styrene butadiene  rubber) can be used directly for the manufacture of vulcan­ ized rubber products.
