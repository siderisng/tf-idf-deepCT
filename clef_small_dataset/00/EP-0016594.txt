<ABSTRACT>
novel phosphonothioate compounds of the general for­ mula    wherein r₁ is lower alkyl   r₂ is a steroid residue which is linked to the rest of the  molecule through any carbon atom which is not one of the  carbon atoms forming a ring junction, or through a side chain  carbon atom, and   n is 1 to 4,   are disclosed as well as the use of these compounds as  immunogenic haptens.  immunogenic hapten-protein complexes and conjugates  of these phosphonothioate compounds and of steroid phos­ phates are also disclosed.
