<ABSTRACT>
for the touch-free measurement of impurity sites in the crystal structure of a silicon wafer (1) due to oxygen atoms in the semiconductor material, the silicon wafer is irradiated with pulsating light and at the same time exposed to a high-frequency field.  the eddy currents produced in the semiconductor wafer alter the loading of the high-frequency oscillator (6).  the number of defects in the crystal structure is inferred from the change in amplitude of the high-frequency oscillations.  to suppress the slow change in the amplitude envelope at the end of the light pulse, the silicon wafer (1) is also irradiated with continuous light.  <image>
