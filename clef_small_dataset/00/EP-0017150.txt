<ABSTRACT>
in an apparatus for refining molten metal comprising, in  combination:   (a) a vessel   (b) inlet and outlet means for molten metal and gases; and   (c) at least one rotating gas distributing means dispersed  in said vessel, said gas distributing means comprising (i) a  rotatable shaft coupled to drive means at its upper end and  fixedly attached to a vaned circular rotor at its lower end; (ii)  a hollow stationary sleeve surrounding said shaft and fixedly  attached at its lower end to a hollow circular stator; (iii) an  axially extending passageway for conveying and discharging  gas into the clearance between the rotor and stator, said  passageway being defined by the inner surface of the sleeve  and stator and the outer surface of the shaft; and (iv) means  for providing gas to the upper end of the passageway under  sufficient pressure to be injected into the vessel,   the improvement comprising utilizing, in the combinaÂ­ tion, a smooth outer surface construction for the stator and a  ratio of the diameter of the stator to the root diameter of the  rotor in the range of 1:1 to about 0. 8:1.
