<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a device that comprises: a  cylindrical peg (7) provided with a succession of circum­ ferential grooves (107) that define a sort of rack (207); an  accepting element (9) provided internally with a hole  (109) inside which the said cylindrical peg (7) can pass,  and at least one receding part and cylindrical groove  (209-309) that communicates with the outside and with  the said hole (109) inside which is housed a pin (12)  that has a cylindrical head (112) toothed circumferential­ ly, the shank of this being provided with a sprocket (212)  destined to mesh with the said rack (207); and a paw  (14) or (16) which can be made to mesh with the toothing  element, laterally to which operates an elastic member  (15, (25) or (20), which tends to keep it engaged with  the said toothing of the cylindrical head (112).

-   bits.    3 and 4 show the accepting element of the device  as illustrated in figs. 1 -and 2, with the contrivances  connected thereto depicted in the way in which   theg    are  to be found at the time the panels to be united are locked  one to the other, and are parted one from the other, res  pectively;   -    fig. 5 shows a second version for the device, with the  parts seen from the front;   -    fig. 6 shows the accepting element of the device as ill  lustrated in fig. 5 but in sectional form along the line    villi    thereof; ;   -    fig. 7 shows a third version for the device, seen from  the front, with the peg and the accepting element unat  tached from one another, with some parts in sectional form  in order that others may be more visible, and with the  pawl in the non-operative position; - fig. 8 shows, from the front, the accepting element of  the device as illustrated in fig. 7, with the pawl placed  in the position of engagement with the toothing of the  head of the pin belonging to the accepting element, in  such a way as to allow the rotation thereof in the same  direction as that in which the peg is inserted into the  body of the accepting element; ;   -    fig. 9 shows in part the accepting element of the device  illustrated in figs. 7 and 8, the pawl being depicted with  a continuous line in the non-operative position and with a  dotted line for the position as in fig. 8.   the three versions illustrated are all based on one and the same basic characteristic method which is achieved with mechanical contrivances that differ one from the other but are all equivalent.      itn    reference to   xigs.    1 and 2, and in conformity with italian patent application   12494a,'79,    the device in question is provided with a peg (7) that has to be rendered integral   (by      screwing    it), cantilever fashion, with a panel   (8),    and  with the toothing of the said cylindrical   heaz    and is placed laterally to the pin with the possibility   oj    effecting displacement movements with respect thereto in order to   allow    the pin to only rotate in the same direction in which the peg is inserted in the body of the accepting element, an elastic member which tends to keep the peg engaged with the toothing of the cylindrical head of the pin, being provided.      0vrith    a device of this type, irrespective of the position of progressive insertion of the peg into the body of the accepting element, when the pawl is in a position of engagement with the toothing of the head of the pin, the   tvio    parts cannot come accidentally apart, and a sizable working stroke is available for tightening one panel to the other with the possibility of easily taking up even play of some entity between the parts.   then taking into consideration that the pressure applied manually to tighten thoroughly the panels one to the other, by pressing one against the other, can never ever be as great as the desired maximum, with the device in question the possibility exists of the two parts being ultimately tightened forcibly by the operator with the aid of a screwdriver or spanner used on the head of the pin provided with the sprocket that meshes with the rack, so as to rotate the pin in the direction allowed by the pawl.   the characteristics of the invention will now be described better in the description that follows of various preferred forms of embodiment, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:   fig.    1 shows the device in a first version, seen from  the front, with the units that go to make it up, in an  expl oded view;   i fig. 2 represents the section along the line ii-i of     the accepting element;     ynce    the head of the peg has been   initially    engaged with the said track, the peg is made, by suitably rotating the bush, to gradually penetrate into the   inside    of the body   oi    the accepting element, in,order to tighten one panel against the other.   here agaixl the actual movement is very limited, and whilst   there    is no risk of the panels being thightened unstably one to the other, as in the previous instance, there is the risk that because of play between the parts when endeavour   nng    to force the tightening to a maximum, the head of the peg may come out o f the spiral track, with the need to repeat the operation and the risk of the grip between the panels. suddenly working loose.   the object of the invention is to solve the aforementioned difficulties and, in particular, to make available a device of the stated type, by means of which the parts can be stably intercoupled right from the time when the two panels to be united are placed one at the side of the other.   based on principles that differ completely from those outlined above for coupling a peg to an accepting element, and in conformity with italian patent applications   12494/79    and   3330h/80,    priority for which is claimed, essential features of the device in question are that the said peg is provided with a succession of circumferential grooves that define a sort of rack, and that the said accepting element has, perpendicularly to the said seating or hole through which the peg passes, at least one housing and one receding part that   commwaicates      with    the outside and with the seating or hole, inside which is housed a pin   with    a cylindrical head that is toothed   circum2-ereiitially      with    small, close set, teeth,   the shank o the said pin being provided with a sprocket destined to mesh   with +.he    said rack at the time the peg is being inserted into the accerting element, the said device comprising,   rthermore,    a pawl that meshes
