<ABSTRACT>
Polyalkylpiperidine derivatives unsubstituted in 1-position of the piperidine ring and bonded to a S-triazine residue in the 4-position via a heteroatom bridge can be converted to a dihalide or a di-, tri- or tetraepoxide in compounds of formula I.Convert, where M is 2.3 or 4.If one obtains from a triazine derivative, which has at least two polyalkylpiperidine substituents, the reaction with dihalides or the poxides of polymers or oligomeric compounds of the formula II, wherein n represents the degree of polymerization and E and E 'the end groups.Both types of compounds are stabilizers for polymers, especially against damage by light.They are characterized by low volatility and low migration tendency, so that they mainly for use in thin polymer layers, such as.b.are of interest in fibers, foils or paints.
