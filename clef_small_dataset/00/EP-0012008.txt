<ABSTRACT>
a toothpaste contains 2% by weight of calcium metasilicate,  0. 80% of sodium monofluorophosphate and 44. 77% calcium  carbonate.  the presence of calcium metasilicate in  combination with the monofluorophosphate and carbonate  increases the fluoride uptake over and above that which is  expected from the level of free fluoride present.

<DESCRIPTION>
pbl hygiene compositions this invention relates to oral hygiene compositions having anti-cariogenic activity, and more particularly to toothpastes, and mouthwashes. it has been recognised for some years that the incorporation of ionic fluoride compounds into oral hygiene compositions such as toothpastes and mouthwashes provides them with anti-cariogenic activity. this activity is believed to result from the ability of fluoride to reduce the solubility of tooth enamel in slightly acid media which frequently occur in the raouth as a result of the action of bacteria on food. this solubility-reducing effect is thought to result from the conversion of hydroxyapatite, a principal mineral component of tooth enamel, into a less soluble mineral, fluoroapatite. it is generally recognised that ionic monofluorophospates are the most effective anti-cariogenic fluoridating agent. it is thought in some quarters that monoiluorophosphates exert their effect at least in part, by h-drolysing to phosphate and fluoride ion, which is subsequently incorporated into tooth enamel. it has been found that the presence of certain quantities of carbonate ion and metasilicate ion in a solution containing dissolved monofluorophosphate ion increases the quantity of free fluoride ion concentration available in solution and that when teeth are treated by such solutions, not only is there an increase in fluoride uptake over and above that which would be expected for the level of free fluoride present, but also there is a significant decrease in the dissolution rate of tooth enamel mineral after such treatment as compared with that expected for the level of free fluoride ions. these effects are principally dependent upon the amount of dissolved metasilicate ion which is formed in the mouth, usually by dilution of an oral hygiene composition wit saliva. the effects are not seen in the presence of alumina. according to the present invention there is provided an oral hygiene composition, substantially free of alumina, coraprising a source of metasilicate ions, a source of carbonate ions and a source of monofluorophosphate ions, the sources being present in amounts such that, in use, an aqueous solution containing from 3.5 to 7.0 x 10 mol.l 1 dissolved metasilicate ions, from 1.0 to 2 x 10 2 r.lol.l 1 dissolved monofluorophosphate ions ad from 0.5 z. 10 4 to 1.0 x 10 raol.l 1 dissolved carbonate ions is produced in the mouth. preferably the concentration of metasilicate ions is about 5 x 10 4 mol.l. the source of metasilicate ions may be silicic acid or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof which is at least sparingly soluble in aqueous media. examples of such salts include alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium metasilicate. calcium metasilicate is a particularly preferred source of ions. the source of monofluorophosphate ions is suitably a physiologically acceptable salt which is soluble in aqueous media. examples of such salts include alkali metal monofluorophosphates of which sodium monofluorophosphate na2p03f is especially preferred. the source of carbonate ions is also a soluble or sparingly soluble physiologically acceptable carbonate salt. examples include alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium carbonate
