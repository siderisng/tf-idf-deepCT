<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for devolatilizing materials, such as solvent  containing polymers, includes a cylindrical housing (15)  having a screw member (20, 24, 30) rotatably mounted in the  housing and operative to work material so as to release  contained vapourizable substances from the material.  an  inlet fitting (12) for the housing is located opposite a part (20)  of the screw member and a venting section (40) extends from  the housing adjacent this inlet fitting.  the screw member has  a screw vent control section (22) extending within the  venting section and arranged to convey material toward the  discharge end of the housing.  a vent pipe (50) is connected  to the venting section (40) for conducting away vapourized  substances released from the material past the screw vent  control section, and breaker bars (42) cooperate with the  latter section to clean from the screw member material  tending to cling thereto and clog the passage between the  venting section and the screw vent control section.
