<ABSTRACT>
a dual mode copier which automatically switches the  recirculating document handler (10) and copy output  system (58, 59, 60) between pre-collation and post-collation  modes of operation in response to a selection in the  copy counter control (70) of a number of copies which  exceeds a pre-set crossover copy count, and which may  provide a first pre-collation proof set in both modes.  a pre/post-collation switch device (70) automatically  switches said copier between said pre-collation mode of  operation and said post-collation mode of operation,  wherein in said pre-collation mode of operation the copies  are routed to copy set collector (60), and wherein in said  post-collation mode of operation the copies are routed to  sorting apparatus (58, 59), and wherein in said precollation  mode of operation said documents are copied once in  each circulation, and wherein in said post-collation mode  of operation said documents are copied in each circulation  by a number of times corresponding to the setting of the  selectable copy counter control (70) but not more than  said pre-determined number of said bins of said sorting  apparatus (58) (59).  the pre/post-collation switching  device (70) is automatically actuated to switch between  said pre-collation mode of operation and said post-collation  mode of operation in response to a selection in said  copy counter control (70) of a number of copy sets which  exceeds a pre-set crossover copy count.
