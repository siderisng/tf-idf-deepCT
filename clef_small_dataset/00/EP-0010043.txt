<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a turning device of the pressure (0) of sheet (33) which allows their maintenance pen ding the machining.The assembly (0) is constituted by two columns (17) containing compression washers (20) exerting pressure on the sheets, via the rollers (21), relying on the shoulders of the stems, (19) circlips (42) limiting their low race;The crown (10) receives its rotating motion with a pinion (27) driven by a motor (29) whose second shaft animates a reducing (31) linked to a resolver (32) rotating at the same speed as the crown (10), as a result, the numerical method of the machine places the position of the axis (18) perpendicular to the machining direction line.A cylinder (5) enslaves and controls the depth of the tool (9) as well as the contact of the compression means.
