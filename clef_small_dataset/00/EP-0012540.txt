<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a method of, and apparatus for,  controlling the fuel to air ratio of the fuel mixture to an inter­ nal combustion engine which includes a fuel mixture feed  system having a known type of carburettor and has the ob­ ject of increasing the range of engine speeds and operating  conditions in which the fuel to air ratio approaches the opti­ mum value in comparison with the ranges achieved by carbu­ rettors of the type normally used.  in the method the fuel mix­ ture is supplemented with air and exhaust gas by utilizing  pressure controlled air and exhaust gas valves (7, 8) operated  by pressure changes in the fuel feed system and/or intake  manifold of the engine so that the valves open when the fuel  to air ratio of the fuel mixture supplied by the carburettor is in  excess of a predetermined value.
