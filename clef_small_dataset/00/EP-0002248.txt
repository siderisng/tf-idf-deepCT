<ABSTRACT>
1.  push rods (9', 9") producing an interlocking mechanism on the rebated window sash or door leaf (3) of two-winged doors or double-sashed casement windows without a centre upright, on which the window sidelights or door leaves (2 and 3) and the rigid frame (1) are composed of hollow metal or plastic sections where furthermore a so-called overlap (6) is connected as an outer rebate for the overlying sash or leaf (2) to the opening side member (5) of the under sidelight or leaf (3) and where, for example, a t-shaped or dovetail undercut channel (8) is molded to receive into the rebated window sash or door leaf (3) the sliding push rods (9', 9") of which the activating mechanism (11) mounted in a housing (12, 13) anchored to the rebated sidelight or leaf (3) consists of a turning drive unit (15) and two thrust members (14', 14") protruding from the housing which can be moved in a contra-rotating action in a four-sided guide by the latter (15), the said thrust members being connected to the push rods (9', 9") by coupling members sliding into coupling holes and where the overlap section (6) overlaps the activating mechanism (11) anchored to the inner sidelight or leaf (3) and the push rods (9', 9") as a protection and provides a hole (38) in line of axis position with the nut or with the driver pin (24) of drive unit (15) through which an operating handle (25) arranged on the outer side of the overlap section (6) engages with the nut or driver pin (24) in a detachable manner and is retained on the nut or driver pin (24) of the turning drive unit (15) together with a corresponding neck-piece (26) having a many-sided recess (27) by a bolt (41) which can be screwed into the threaded hole (39) of the driver pin (24), distinguished by the fact that the housing (12, 13) of the activating mechanism (11) can be adjusted and locked in the guide-channel (8) of the inner sidelight or leaf (3) by an undercut pedestal piece (30) firmly connected to it, especially as an integral unit, the said housing being fitted with threaded bolts (32) as securing elements which are braced through holes (34) in the cover plate (13) of the mechanism housing (12, 13) against the floor of the channel (8), that the parts (17' 17") of the thrust members (14', 14") protruding from the housing (12, 13) are pins (17', 17") forming the coupling members, the said pins protruding through elongated holes (18', 18") in the floor of the housing (19) of the activating mechanism (11) whose ends, which are turned toward each other, are each separated by a space from the ends of the pedestal piece (30), that the operating handle (25) has in its neck piece (26) a compression spring (42) as an elastic distance-piece, the operating handle (25) being held in an axial and infinitely adjustable manner against the force of the said spring by the bolt (41) on the driver pin (24), and that the thrust members (14', 14") in the housing (12, 13) of the activating mechanism (11) are guided on four sides between the walls of the housing and a longitudinal ledge (28) provided on the floor of the housing (19).
