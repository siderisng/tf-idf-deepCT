<ABSTRACT>
heat is stored at a steady temperature (about 29°c)  using calcium chloride hexahydrate and up to 20 percent  strontium chloride hexahydrate to assist crystallisation.  this  heat storage medium is placed in a heat storage device com­ prising means to seal the medium from water vapour.

<DESCRIPTION>
technical field of the invention this invention relates to the cladding of structural steel members for decorative and/or fire protection purposes. in particular, it relates to a method of attaching cladding boards to i or t section steel joists, herein referred to as flanged structural steelwork. the prior art hitherto, boards have been attached to such steelwork by methods involving the use of battens and/or blocks of material jammed or otherwise secured to the steelwork between or extending along the flanges. the boards have been thereafter screwed or nailed to these battens/blocks, sometimes with the aid of adhesive compositions to fill any gaps. the object of these fixing methods is to substantially completely enclose the flanged structural steelwork without actually drilling into it, if at all possible. in general terms, the use of such methods is labour-intensive and frequently necessitates the carrying out of complicated assembly work in relatively inaccessible locations, often with the aid of ladders and/or scaffolding. description of the invention the invention resides in the use of u-shaped metal channel members to attach cladding boards to flanged structural steelwork (as herein defined). according to one aspect of the invention, method of attaching cladding boards to flanged structural steelworls (as herein defined) comprises the steps of fastening the base of a metal u-section channel member to each one of a pair of boards so that the arms of the u project substantially normally of the board, presenting the boards to the steelwork so that an opposite directed flange thereof is received in each of said channels presenting a third board to the other two so as to fridge the gap between them and lie against an arm of each channel followed by fastening said third board to each of said arms. it will be appreciated that the foregoing method serves to clad flanged structural steel work on three sides, but the principle applies equally to the fourth side of an i-section joist, the method then including the steps of fastening u-shaped channels to each of the first two boards and presenting and fastening a fourth board, in the same manner as the third board, above. however, according to another aspect of the invention, the method comprises joining two boards at right angles by fastening them to one arm and the base respectively of.a u-shaped metal channel member to form an l-shaped assembly and fastening a second u-shaped metal channel member to one of said boards so that the arms of the u extend from the board parallel to those of the first channel member in the assembly; a second such assembly of opposite hand is then formed and the two assemblies are presented to opposite sides of an 1-section flanged structural steelwork joist so that the parallel flanges thereof are received in the respective parallel channels with an arm of each assembly abutted against one of the respective side walls of each of the second channel members, followed by fastening said arms to said side walls to substantially

what we claim is :    1. a method of attaching cladding boards to flanged  structural steelwork (as aereinbefore defined)  so as to substantially enclose the latter, the  method including the step of fastening each of  said boards to one side wall or to the base of  a u-shaped metal channel into which a flange of  the steelwork is received and retained therein  by the boards fastened to said channel member.    2. a method according to claim 1 for attaching cladding  boards to flanged structural steelwork, the   method     comprising the steps of fastening the base of a  metal u-section channel member to each one of a  pair of boards so that the arms of the u project  substantially, normally of the board, presenting  the boards to the   steelworh    so that an oppositely  directed flange thereof is received in each of  said channels, presenting a third board to the  other two so as to bridge the gap between them  and lie against an. arm of each channel followed  by two fastening said third board to each of said  arms.    3. a method according to claim 1 for attaching cladding  boards to flanged structural steelwork, the method  comprising joining two boards at right angles by  fastening them to one arm and the base respectively    - - b'f' a    u-shaped metal channel member to form an   i,-     shaped assembly and fastening a second u-shaped  metal channel member to one of said boards so that  the arms of   the    u extend from the board parallel  to those of the first channel member in the assembly;  ;  a second such assembly of opposite hand is then      ios asset two j'ssemblies r resentd to       opposits    sides of an i-section flanged structural  steelwork joist so that the parallel flanges thereof  are received in the respective parallel channels  with an arm of each assembly abutted against   one     of the respective side walls of each of the second  channel   members a    followed by fastening said arms  to said side walls to substantially enclose the  i-section joist.   '4. a method according to any preceding claim wherein  the boards are fastened to the channel by self  tapping screws.   5. a method of attaching cladding boards to flanged  structural steelwork (as herein defined) substantially  as described with reference to and as illustrated  by the accompanying drawings.
