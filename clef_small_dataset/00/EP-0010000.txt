<ABSTRACT>
mastic, caulking, sealant or adhesive compositions are  provided which contain a photosensitive compound, such as  benzophenone, which, upon exposure to actinic radiation,  renders the surface of the composition tack free and mildew  resistant while the remainder of the composition remains  flexible.  the compositions also contain a binder polymer con­ taining acid units which is preferably derived from acrylic  monomers and may also contain air-curable units.  the inven­ tion also embraces a method of reducing the surface tack of  such compositions using the photosensitive compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
mastic, caulking, sealant and adhesive compositions containing photosensitive compounds and method of reducing their surface tack this invention is ccncerned with improved mastic, caulking, sealant or adhesive compositions containing photo sensitive compound which compositions yield a finished product whose surface becomes tack-free relatively quickly upon exposure to actinic radiation while the remainder of the product substantially retains its flexibility upon extended exposure to the source of active radiation. the invention is also concerned with the use of such compositions, particularly in a method of reducing surface tackiness. well known caulk or sealant compositions are exemplified in u.s. patent no. 3,561,996. an example in that patent is a caulking composition of 82.68 solids as follows: "(4) (a) a caulking composition of 82.6% solids is made up by mixing 430.17 lbs. of a 55% solids aqueous dispersion of an emulsion copolymer of 81.5% ethyl acrylate, 15 methyl methacrylate, and 3.5% itaconic acid, 9.46 lbs. of tert-octylphenoxypoly-(39)ethoxy ethanol, 1q.65 lbs. of sodium hexametaphosphate, 124.21 lbs. of a plasticizer for the copolymer (an oxypropylene derivative of m,p-cresylic acid), 26.91 lbs. mineral spirits, 1.27 lbs. of a 30% aqueous poly methacrylic acid, 692.06 lbs. of pigment grade calcium carbonate extender, and 17.22 libs. of titanium dioxide pigment." u.s. patents 2,865,877 and 2,865,878 disclose as pigment dispersants (1) a water-soluble salt of a copolymer of maleic anhydride with an olefin such as diisobutylene, and (2) a water-insoluble ethylene oxide adduct of an alkyl phenol, the product being useful in coatings. the watersoluble salts are extremely hard and inflexible, and are unsuitable as major components of caulks. u.s. patent 2,889,297 discloses polyvinyl acetate adhesives plasticized with similar adducts of propylene oxide and alkyl phenols. ester type plasticizers in the form of oil modified alkyds have been disclosed for caulks, particularly solvent based caulks, as shown in u.s. patents 3,786,020, 3,919,146 and 3,759,915. u.s. patent 3,554,942 discloses aqueous sealant or spackling compositions comprising water-soluble acrylic copolymer and a water-soluble cellulose ether. u.s. patent 2,986,507 discloses a polymerized, solid, fusible composition, prepared from acrylate and methacrylate monomers, containing thermal catalyst and a "photoin- solublizer" which, prior to being subjected to ultraviolet irradiation, is soluble in organic solvents but after sufficient ultraviolet irradiation is insoluble in such solvents. the composition of the patent is employed in end applications such as making sheets, films, rods, granules, molds, casts, or coatings. u.s. patent 3,661,744 discloses a photocurable liquid polymer composition including a liquid polymer component, a polythiol component, and a photocuring rate accelerator. upon curing in the presence of actinic light, the products of the patent may serve as sealants, coatings, adhesives and molded articles. u.s. patents 3,274,142, 3,297,630 and 3,966,794 disclose polyene-polythiol compositions containing a photocuring rate accelerator. generally, sealants require a delicate balance of properties to yield a finished product which will become tack free relatively quickly under cure conditions, for example under exposure to outdoor conditions, while still retaining its flexibility upon extended exposure to the same conditions for most thermoset solvent based sealants, this balance of properties is
