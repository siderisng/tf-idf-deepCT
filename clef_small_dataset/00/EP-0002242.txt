<ABSTRACT>
a filter assembly is provided having a filter chamber and  a filter element therein that is replaceable without contamination  of filtered fluid with unfiltered fluid even though the  filter chamber is not emptied of unfiltered fluid comprising,  in combination, a filter housing; a filter chamber in the  housing; an inlet for unfiltered fluid and an outlet for filtered  fluid in the housing; a filter element removably disposed in  the filter chamber across the line of fluid flow from the inlet  to the outlet so that fluid flow from the inlet to the outlet  normally proceeds through the filter; a weir spaced from and  downstream of the filter element, compelling filtered fluid  from the filter flowing towards the outlet to proceed  upwardly through the space between the weir and the filter  and then by overflow across the weir; and a weir follower  operatively associated with the base of the filter element and  movable along the weir in fluid-tight relation to the base and  the weir, to carry filtered fluid in the space between the weir  and the filter element on the downstream side of the filter  element to the top of the weir while a used filter element is  being removed, and to displace unfiltered fluid in the filter  chamber from contact with the downstream side of a clean  filter element while the clean filter element is being installed.   the filter assembly is particularly suited for use as a return  line filter mounted in a tank.
