<ABSTRACT>
a frangible cartridge for anchoring a reinforcing element  such as a rock-bolt in a borehole drilled in rock strata, for  example an underground mine roof, contains as separate  constituents (a) an aqueous liquid and an alkali metal silicate  and (b) a gelling agent for the alkali metal silicate, the gelling  agent being capable of forming a gel from the alkali metal  silicate when brought into contact therewith as a result of the  reinforcing element being caused to break the cartridge and  mix together the constituents (a) and (b) within the borehole  so as to form a grouting composition around the reinforcing  element, the grouting composition when hardened serving  to anchor the reinforcing element in the borehole.  in a  preferred embodiment, a hydraulic substance such as a  hydraulic cement is incorporated in constituent (b) and is  hardened by the aqueous liquid present in constituent (a)  when the contents of the cartridge are mixed by the  reinforcing element.  the cartridge of the invention is safer  for use, particularly in coal mines, than the conventional  resinous cartridges.
