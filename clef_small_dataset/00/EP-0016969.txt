<ABSTRACT>
light barrier apparatus generally features a light trans­ mitter for projecting light across a region to be monitored  to a light receiver.  the light transmitter and receiver units  can either be separate or can be combined in a single  housing and used in conjunction with a retro-reflector for  returning light from the sender to the receiver.  in any of these arrangements the light transmitter and/­ or sender units incorporate photoelectric converter com­ ponents (11, 12) and optical projection components (13,  14) together with electronic processing elements which  enable interruption of the light barrier to be detected.  the  present arrangement features a housing (17) including at  least one sealed chamber (15; 15′, 15″) containing solely  the optical and photoelectric converter elements.  these  chambres are thus sealed against the ingress of contamina­ tion and moisture.  the remaining elements of the electronic  processing circuit are housed separately in a further cham­ ber (16).  the housing together with the fixed walls (18,  18′, 18″) of the sealed chambers (15, 15′, 15″) is use­ fully injection molded in one piece and preferably together  with sighting aids (22).
