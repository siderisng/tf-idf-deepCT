<ABSTRACT>
an improved power capacitor dielectric system utilizes  the combination of electrode foils (34,35) having a raised  dimple pattern on their surfaces, and polypropylene film (36,  37) as the dielectric, the polypropylene film preferably having  a texture pattern on one surface.  the electrode foil (34,35)  suitably comprises a sort annealed aluminum foil strip having  a plurality of individual curvilinear surfaced dimple like pro­ jections and depressions from the plane of the foil, said pro­ jections and depressions being coterminous with the length  and breadth of the useful foil surface in an electrical capacitor,  said dimple-like projections being formed and spaced apart in  a manner whereby there is a smooth essentially continuously  curving foil surface leading from one dimple to an adjacent  projection so that a point on the base of one dimple and a  point on the adjacent base of a projection are essentially  coincident.

tithe: improved ihlpregnation capacitor and electrode foil therefor this invention relates to improved capacitor grade aluminum -foil -and to an improved capacitor including such2 and more particularly to a dielectric fluid filled capacitor structure wherein solid synthetic resin dielectric strips and foil electrode strips have mutually complementary roughened and patterned interface surfaces to stabilize their spaced relationship and to facilitate fluid penetration therebetween. fluid impregnated capacitors made up of alternating electrode foil and synthetic resin film strips wound in a tight roll form have been difficult-e impregnate with dielectric fluids because although a capacitor roll is wound with a certain degree of looseness, defined as space factor, the fluid must not only penetrate into.the roll from the ends- thereof,- but must also perpetrate the interfaces between film strips which stick together, -and between-film and foil strips which also stick together. in order to overcome this well known and common problem, a a number of solutions have been proposed which relate to complex impregnation cycles and roughening of the foil and/or film surfaces by various surface disfiguration methods, including mechanical and chemical processes.such as foil embossing, abrading, and coating, and film etching. - - ;- - the problems associated with these solutions have been | numerous, ranging from poor overall fluid impregnation and electrical test results, undesirable increase of thickness of the capacitor roll without correlation to the required space factor of the capacitor, and poor economics because of the additional processing required. more importantly the reliability and repeatability of acceptable electrical tests for capacitors produced from the usual manufacturing processes have been deleteriously affected by these prior solutions. it has been discovered that the foregoing problems may be overcome or minimized by the winding together, in roll form, a special unique surface polypropylene film denoted "hazy" film (tm general electric company) and a specially patterned- metal electrode foil surface. this combination, when used with preferred fluids facilitates fluid impregnation of a roll to provide an improved, more stable capacitor-of uniform space factor wherein a synthetic resin film such as polypropylene film is the sole dielectric between foil electrodes. this invention will be better understood when taken in connection with the following description and drawings in which: fig. 1 'is an exaggerated illustration of a capacitor roll in partly unrolled form to show dielectric film and electrode foil relationships. fig. 2 is an illustration of an electrical capacitor assembly utilizing a single capacitor roll of fig. 1 fig. 3 is an illustration of a high voltage power factor correction capacitor assembly utilizing a plurality of -- the capacitor rolls as shown in fig. 1. fig. 4 is a plan view of a section of foil electrode, showing a pattern layout of the electrode foil. ¸'- fig. 5 is a cross sectional view, in line form, of the patterned electrode foil of fig. 4. 4 fig. 6 is an exaggerated illustration of the use od t pattern electrode foil and hazy film in smooth toeroug g relationship as the sole dielectric in
