<ABSTRACT>
a key-operated device, for example for controlling access  to switch gear or potentially dangerous machinery, has a  rotary motion with an axially inserted key but departs from the  usual barrel lock construction which is sensitive to foreign  matter.  instead it has a faceplate 3 in front of a stationary body  2 with a cylindrical member 1 rotatable in it and having a  recess for the key4 and circumferentially spaced notches 10 in  a flange 9 close behind the plate 3 and prevented from direct  access through the keyhole by a fixed axially extending wall  13 on the back of the plate but accessible by appropriate lugs  12 on the key when the latter is inserted.  the rotatable  member is connected through a spindle 5 to a switch, valve or  latch or other actuated device.
