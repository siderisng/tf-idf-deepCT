<ABSTRACT>
apparatus and method for laying a pipeline on the sea­ bottom which includes a boyant body (12) comprised of a  toroidal buoyancy tank, a central hub (16) and radial spokes.   the body (12) is adapted to carry a single, continuous length  of pipe.  the pipe (28) is wrapped on the body (12) when he is  horizontally disposed and floating on the water.  the body (12)  with the convolutions of pipe (28) are towed to the second site  while the body (12) and the pipe (28) remain horizontally  disposed.  the the tank receives over valves (74) sea water to  unbalance the body (12) and cause it to be moved into a  vertical position.  in this position, the body (12) is towed for­ wardly and rotated to allow the pipe (28) to be vertically  unwrapped from the body (12) and to gravitate therefrom.  a  second tank (30) having a power mechanism (41) which is  coupled by gear (43) with the body (12) to rotate the body  during a pipe laying operation or during the pipe (28) will be  wrapped onto the body (12).
