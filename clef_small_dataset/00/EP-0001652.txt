<ABSTRACT>
a device for lifting tuberous crops or the like, particularly  beet, comprising a wheeled frame(1) carrying, viewed in the  direction of the movement, in order of succession pairs of  digging members (6) for lifting the tubers out of the soil and a  conveyor (8) for conducting the dug-up tubers away from the  digging members (6) and for cleaning the same, in which  device behind each pair of digging members (6) located at the  side of the front of conveyor (8), the conveying elements (7)  leading to said conveyor (8) are provided, the transverse  dimension of which exceeds the dimension in the direction of  movement, wherein each conveying element (7) is provided  with a sequence of pins travelling along a closed path by  which not only the structural length can be minimized but also  lifting the tubers out of the soil and cleaning them are performed  more effectively.
