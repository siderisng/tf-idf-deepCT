<ABSTRACT>
phosphoric acid is purified by a process which comprises  treating the crude acid solution with a body feed agent and a  flocculating agent to cause a portion of the impurities to settle  out, and contacting the partially clarified acid with activated  carbon for further impurity removal.  in the preferred process,  hot wet process phosphoric acid from the plant filter is first  cooled to a temperature of from about 100°f to about 130°f  and then treated in the above-described manner.
