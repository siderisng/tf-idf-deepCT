<ABSTRACT>
a method of making a luminescent screen suitable for  use in a cathode-ray tube which is operated with a highly  loaded luminescent screen.  a luminescent screen comprising  a substrate (12) bearing a luminescent layer is produced  by spraying a stable aerosol containing a solution (7a) of  compounds which are converted on heating into a luminescent  material onto the substrate (12) which is maintained at a  temperature at which this conversion occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
"method of producing luminescent screens, luminescent screens produced by this method and cathode-ray tubes including such luminescent screens". the invention relates to a method of producing a luminescent screen comprising a substrate bearing a luminescent layer, the substrate being heated to an elevated temperature and being contacted at said elevated temperature with a solution of compounds which are converted into luminescent materials at said elevated temperature. in addition, the invention relates to a luminescent screen produced by such a method and to a cathode-ray tube including such a luminescent screen. a method of the type defined in the preamble, wherein the substrate of the luminescent screen is sprayed uith the solution, is disclosed in german offenlegungs schrift 2,516,206. this known method has the drawback that the luminescent layer has a non-uniform thickness and an insufficient adhesion to the substrate. the lack of a proper adhesion becomes especially apparent if the luminescent screen obtained must subsequently be subjected to a high temperature heat treatment. in such a heat treatment, which is usually necessary for obtaining the optimum luminescent properties, the luminescent layer may become detached, wholly or partially, from the substrate. a serious drawback of the screens produced by this known method is that when used in cathode-ray tubes, the luminescent screens must not be subjected to high excitation densities. when the screens are subjected to high excitation densities, the screens are also thermally highly loaded, and it appeared that partly owing to the above-mentioned poor adhesion, the heat conduction between the luminescent layer and the substrate is low, so that the screens become defective owing to burning of the luminescent layer and/or detachment of the luminescent layer from the substrate. in the currently used luminescent screens having a powder layer as the luminescent layer, and which are used extensively in conventional cathode-ray tubes for displaying television pictures, the excitation density has a value in the order of 0,01 w/cmê. the highest load permissible in special cases for screens having a powder layer is approximately 0.5 w/cmê. however, for some applications luminescent screens should be availabie which can be loaded much higher, for example to more than 5 w/cm2. such highly loaded screens are used in cathoderay tubes for generating a very bright light spot. this light spot can be used as a moving or stationary light source or for forming a very bright picture. a very bright moving or stationary light source is, for example, required in a device for optically scanning an information track on an information carrier or in a film scanner for converting photographic pictures into television pictures. the formation of a very bright picture occurs in projection television tubes. highly loadable luminescent screens can be made by means of a chemical gas transport reaction (chemical vapour deposition, cvd) or by epitaxial growth from a solution on a single crystal substrate (liquid phase epitaxy, lpe). both methods have the drawback that they are relatively expensive and that their performance is very critical. in addition, a drawback of
