<ABSTRACT>
a ground vehicle guidance system for following a current-carrying  guidewire (w) provides improved steering  stability over a wide range of speeds and improved immunity  to inductive field anomalies by computing vehicle  heading (psi) and lateral displacement (d) using sensor  signals themselves substantially insensitive to heading  variations, with the sensor signals being processed to provide  steering command signals having specified relationships  to vehicle steering geometry, so that desired damping  factors can be obtained for both forward and reverse  travel.  improved vehicle speed-limiting and stopping circuits  control truck operation in accordance with computed heading  and lateral displacement deviations independently from  each other.  steering system are illustrated both for vehicles  using steerable wheels (sw) and vehicles steered by differential  drive wheel speed control.
