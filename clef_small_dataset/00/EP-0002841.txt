<ABSTRACT>
a microturbulence generator (8) for a papermachine  headbox flow channel (1) complying with newly developed  parametric criteria for optimizing its effectiveness and  methods of adjusting the position of said microturbulence  generator while said papermachine is in-use to accommodate  changes in operating conditions and/or machine  speed are disclosed.  a microturbulence generator complying  with the optimization criteria of the present invention  serves to generate a sufficient degree of microturbulence  near the headbox throat (14) to effectively disperse  pulp floc in a macroturbulent stream of papermaking fibers  to improve formation characteristics, randomize fiber  orientation and reduce tensile ratio in the resulting paper  web.  the disclosed criteria are generally applicable to  headbox flow channels having an angle of convergence  between about 4° and about 20° and are particularly effective  at papermachine speeds in excess of about 244 metres  per minute.
