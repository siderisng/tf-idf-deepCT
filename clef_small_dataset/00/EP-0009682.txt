<ABSTRACT>
A water filter, in particular for aquarium water, consists of a filter chamber having a water inlet and a water outlet and filled with interchangeable fil material, and one of the water outlet after the pumped pump. In order to achieve that with one and the same filter material rial filling can be done optimally for over a longer time, the filter chamber is formed by an annular space (10) between two concentric pipes (2,3) different diameters, the outer tube (2) As a precise pure lease has a perforation (7) disposed over its entire circumference and its entire length and the inner tube (3) is also provided over its entire circumference and its entire length with a perforation (9). At one end of the inner tube (3), a water outlet line closes while the other end of the inner tube is closed. In this construction, the entire filter material used can be fully utilized and also easier to replace the filter meter rials.
