<ABSTRACT>
there are disclosed novel 15-deoxy-16-hydroxy-16-­ substituted prostanoic acid analogs in which the c-1 carboxyl  is replaced by a primary alcohol and carboxylic acid esters,  carbonates and carbamates thereof, and which have utility as  bronchodilators, as hypotensive agents, and as agents for the  control of excessive gastric secretion.  the novel compounds  are represented by the formula:    wherein q is a divalent cyclopentyl moiety selected from the  group consisting of:    wherein r/ is an alkyl (c₃-c₇) optionally substituted with one  or more alkyl groups of one to three carbon atoms; r₂ is  selected from the group hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, a  protecting group such as tetrahydropyran-2-yl-oxy,  triloweralkylsilyloxy; or alkoxyalkoxy such as    wherein r′ is hydrogen or alkyl (c₁-c₄) and r″ is alkyl (c₁-c₄);  x is the divalent radical    wherein r₃ is selected from the group vinyl and cyclopropyl; z  is selected from the group -(ch₂)₄,    wherein r₄ is selected from the group alkyl (c₁-c₄); alkoxy  (c₁-c₄); dialkylamino (c₁-c₄); phenyl and phenyl substituted  with one or more substituents selected from the group con­ sisting of hydrogen, hydroxyl, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, low­ eralkylthia, fluoride or chloride, wherein lower alkyl is c₁-c₄;  the formula above embraces the optical isomers, racemic or
