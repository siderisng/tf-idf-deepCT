<ABSTRACT>
a multipolar resolver having a substantially cylindrical  rotor of magnetic material with a·n rotor poles (12, b₁-b₁₀)  provided equidistantly on the outer periphery thereof, a  stator of magnetic material with b·n stator poles (p₁-p₈)  provided equidistantly along the circumference concentric  with the axis of said rotor, and a central coil (15) provided  on said stator along substantially the same axis as said  rotor axis.  a, b and n are positive integers and the value of a dif­ fers from the value of b by one such that |a-b| = 1.  in order to provide a multipolar resolver which re­ quires no coils on the rotor and which permits an increase  in the number of poles of the resolver without a correspond­ ing increase in complexity and manufacturing cost, sine  and cosine coils (16, s₁-s₄; 17, c₁-c₄) are wound alter­ nately on circumferentially successive ones of the stator  poles (p₂, p₄, p₆, p₈; p₁, p₃, p₅, p₇).  circumferentially succes­ sive ones of the sine coils (16, s₁-s₄) are connected in  series with each other and are wound in opposite directions  of winding alternately and circumferentially successive ones  of said cosine coils (17, c₁-c₄) are connected in series  with each other and wound in opposite directions of wind­ ing alternately.
