<ABSTRACT>
the present invention provides a reinforced glass laminate,  comprising a non-hydrophilic synthetic resin, at least  one surface of which has been rendered hydrophilic by  bonding thereon a layer of a hydrophilic material, a layer of  hydrophilic synthetic resin being bonded to said layer of  hydrophilic material and a layer of glass being bonded to  said layer of hydrophilic synthetic resin.  the present invention also provides a process for  producing a reinforced glass laminate, wherein a non-hydrophilic  synthetic resin is coated with a solution capable  of forming a layer of a hydrophilic material thereon, the  solvent medium is then removed, a hydrophilic synthetic  resin is placed on the layer of hydrophilic material and glass  is then placed on the hydrophilic synthetic resin, whereafter  bonding together of the layers is achieved either by applying  an increased pressure at an elevated temperature or by  heating under reduced pressure.
