<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a machine for producing velor needle felt sheets by machining a fiber-solidified non-bonded by needling fiber floral loops forming velor or fork charges (17), wherein a multi-layered nonwoven fabric strip (46) helical to a helical around its axis rotating and continuously moving in the axial direction is wound, wherein the individual layers of the nonwoven belt per turn partially overlap each other and the lower or internal layers (61) of the wound hose (27) in a width, the smaller, preferably up to about half of the half is solidified as the width of the nonwoven belt, in a known manner by means of felt needles (16) and from the upper or outlined loose fiber layer (62) of the wound hose which the poleschlingen forming fibers in Be knitted manner by means of forabel levels (17) by the available to be pushed through the lower or internal fiber layer, and wherein the finished hose cut into the axial direction, flattened and the web (73) thus formed is wound up.
