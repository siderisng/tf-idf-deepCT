<ABSTRACT>
there is disclosed a method of forming a decorative  heat-and-pressure consolidated laminate by assembling  between platens a plurality of superimposed plies of thermo足 setting resin impregnated sheets and a release medium hav足 ing a transferable, gluable coating on the side of the release  medium placed against an outermost ply, and applying heat  and pressure through the platens to consolidate the laminate  and to transfer the gluable coating from the release medium  to the outermost ply.  there is also disclosed a decorative  heat-and-pressure consolidated laminate comprising a plural足 ity of superimposed plies of thermosetting resin impregnated  sheets having on one of the outermost plies a gluable coating.   there is further disclosed a method of gluing a decorative  heat-and-pressure consolidated laminate to a reinforcing  substrate without the need for sanding the back of the lami足 nate before gluing which comprises providing on one surface  of the laminate a gluable coating applying a coating of glue  between the gluable coating and the substrate and adhering  the laminate to the substrate.  the gluable coating comprises a  linear copolymer of (a) maleic anhydride or maleic acid or  maleic acid salt and (b) ethylene or a vinyl monomer having a  side chain or an aliphatic group with up to four carbon atoms  or an alkoxy group with up to four carbon atoms.
