<ABSTRACT>
a hemostatic clip applicator (2) useful in the rapid and  automatic application of hemostatic clips for the strangula­ tion of tubular members is disclosed.  the applicator consists  of a main body, a clip magazine externally attached to the  main body, clip deforming jaws (32, 34) attached to one end of  the main body, clip feed means (18) located within the main  body and actuating means (5, 7) attached to the feed means  and deforming jaws.  in operation, one of many hemostatic  clips stored in the clip magazine is fed into the main body and  guided to the deforming jaws by the interaction of the actuat­ ing means and the feed means.  when the clip is properly  located about a tubular member, further actuation of the  actuating means results in the deformation of the clip about  the tubular member.  upon further activation of the actuating  means, the sequential process of feeding a clip from the  magazine and deforming the clip about other tubular mem­ bers may be rapidly repeated until the supply of clips in the  magazine is depleted.
