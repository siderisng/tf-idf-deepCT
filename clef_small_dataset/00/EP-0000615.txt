<ABSTRACT>
the compounds of the formula (i):    wherein x represents a moiety of the sub-formula (a) or (b):    have been found to be Î²-lactamase inhibitors which may be  used in pharmaceutical compositions to enhance the effectiveness  of penicillins or cephalosporins.  the diene of the  formula (i) may be produced by the decarboxylation of  clavulanic acid or a derivative thereof and the monoene of  the formula (i) may be produced by the 1,4 addition of hydrogen  to the diene of the formula (i).  the diene is thus also  useful as a chemical intermediate and other such uses are  demonstrated.
