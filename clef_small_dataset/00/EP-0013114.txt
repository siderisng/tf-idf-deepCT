<ABSTRACT>
 multikeeled hull (1) having an inflatable member or  members (11) constrained to lie between the flexible skin (3)  of the boat and a reaction surface (4).  preferably there is a rigid  deck as a reaction surface (4) overlying the flexible skin (3)  with two parallel inflatable tubes (11) under the deck spaced  apart by a distance approximately equal to half the width of  the deck.  between the keels formed by the tubes (11) the  floxible skin (3) forms a channel which is self-adjusting  (15,15â€²) according to the loading of the boat.

<DESCRIPTION>
inflatable boat this invention relates to inflat-able boats, that is boats havinq i inflatable flotation members, and is concerned with the keel arrangements of such boats. there have been numerous prior proposals relating to the underwater surface of inflatable boats, and it has also been suggested that for rigid-hull boats multi-keel underwater surfaces should he provided. thus in british patent 1,273,692 there is disclosed a boat hull provided in a forward section with a twin keel and in a rearward section with a single keel. the forward twin keels may each be lowerable or raisable to improve riding characteristics of the hull. in british patent 1,319,072 there is disclosed an inflatable boat in which the shape of the hull is a function of the hull construction itself of a number of inflatable tubes which cooperate to provide a generally u-shaped or v-shaped cross-section for the hull. in british patent 1,362,677 there is disclosed an inflatable boat having inflatable side walls serving as floatation members, a flexible underwater skin, a rigid deck and between said skin and deck an inflatable former member along the longitudinal centre-line of the boat shaping the flexible skin to form a central keel. hovaver in none of these prior art proposals has it @@en appreciated or suggested that by having a boat with a flexible underwater skin and inflatable former members to cause the undersea surface of the boat to have a multi-keel construction, automatic adaptation of the planing characteristics of the boat to the load carried in the boat could be achieved. the present invention is concerned to form, by inflation, a lti-eel underwater surface. the proposal uses the flexibility of a fabric skin, stretched over shaped inflated formers, to allow inherently tlie adaptation of the shape of the underwater surface to load conditions being experienced. this gives a self-compensating underwater surface which retains its ood planing performance under all load conditions. the use of parallel twin inflated formers (preferably separate sacs or tubes) to give a generally w-section under1 surface is simplest and at the same time yields very good results. the spacing apart of the parallel fcrmers may be approximately 50% of the deck width of the boat, when only two keels are present. the floor will provide the reaction surface again which the formers act and will most conveniently be rigid panels extending the whole width of the boat and terminating under, and being supported by, the inflated buoyancy tubes of the boat. boats thus conatructed may be of any appropriate size but especially suitable will be application of this invention to boats of larger sizes, e.g. 5 metres length upwards, whether with single or multiple engine installations. a particular boat embodying the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein: figure 1 is a plan view of the forward part of the boat; figure 2 is a perspective view of the forward part of the boat; figure 3 is a partial, diagrammatic, lateral section; figure 4 is

<CLAIMS>
   claims:-      1. an inflatable boat having a keel formed by inflating an inflatable member or members constrained to lie between a flexible skin of the boat and a reaction surface characterised in that a multiple keel (14,14) is so formed.   2. an inflatable boat according to claim 1, wherein the reaction surface consists of a rigid deck (4) overlying the flexible skin (3).   3. an inflatable boat according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the multiple keel is a twin keel whose inflatable members are two parallel tubes (11,11).   4. an inflatable boat according to claim 3, wherein access to the inflatable tubes is gained through openings (13) in the rigid deck (4) 5. an inflatable boat according to claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the parallel tubes (11,11) are spaced apart by a distance equal to half the width of the deck.
