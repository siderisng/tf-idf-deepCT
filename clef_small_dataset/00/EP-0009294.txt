<ABSTRACT>
method and device for continuous lateral stretching of  a web of reticulate film material with little resistance to la­ teral stretching to a constant width.  in the method the material is passed to pairs of  clamping rollers (5, 6) mounted at either side of the web  which clamp the web at the desired width and which are  so controlled by a controlling mechanism that, when the  desired web width is deviated from, the angle included by  the clamping roller shafts and the sides of the web in the  plane of the web is readjusted.  the device includes guide and/or tensioning rollers  for the web of unstretched reticulate film material and pho­ tocells (16, 17) monitoring the side edges of the web and  coupled to controlling mechanisms for the pair of clamping  rollers.  the clamping rollers have axes of rotation situated  within the width of these rollers.
