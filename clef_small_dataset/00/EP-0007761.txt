<ABSTRACT>
new cumylphenol derivatives are described which are  useful as reactive diluents, plasticizers and impact modifiers  for polymeric materials.  the derivatives include alkenyl esters  of monocarboxylic acids, esters of polycarboxylic acids, and  the esters of boric acid, and alkenyl and aralkyl esters.  the  borate ester of cumylphenol is particularly useful as impact  modifiers with flame retardant properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
cumylphenol derivatives cumylphenol and certain of its derivatives have been described in the prior art. see particularly tsivunin et a'., biol. alcliv. soidin. 1968, 172-5 (russ.). finding a use for such materials has been particularly desirable since they are readily available as byproducts from commerdal processes such as the making of phenol from cumene. similarly, it has long been desired to improve the properties of polymeric material and reactive diluents, plasticizers and impact modifiers which serve such functions at low costs have long been sought. though numerous materials are brown to satisfy these needs, - they are frequently deficient because of their costs or because of incompatibility with the particular polymer. the invention concerns derivatives of cumylphenol and their use in polymeric materials. more specifically, the invention describes alkenyl, monocarboxylic acid esters of cumylphenol; polycarboxylic acid esters of cumylphenol; inorganic esters of cumylphenol; and alkenyl and aralkyl ethers of cumylphenol. these materials are useful as reactive diluents in epoxy, phenolic, and urethane compounds; effective as plasticizers in polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and urethane; and useful as impact modifiers in styrene-acrylonitrile, polystyrene, phenolic and polyvinyl chloride resins. additionally, the borate ester has flame retardant properties. while not each and every cumylphenol derivative is effective in all of the aforesaid applications, these compounds all exhibit useful properties within certain of the aforesaid fields. cumylphenol and derivatives thereof have been found useful as reactive diluents for a variety of resins, e. g ., epoxy, furan, phenolic, urethane, polyester and acrylate resins. the alkenyl esters are useful in polyesters and acrylates. these compounds are new compositions of matter and provide a low cost replacement for conventionally employed co-monomeric materials. in certain instan-ces, their use improves the chemical and physical properties of the cured resins. in still another embodiment of the invention, it has been found that esters of cumylphenol are useful as non-reactive plasticizers for polyurethanes. here again the cost of the finished resin may be markedly reduced. in a further embodiment of the invention, the borate, benzyl, and glutarate esters and the benzyl and allyl ethers of cumylphenol have been found to be useful impact modifiers for polystyrene, styrene-acrylonitrile, phenolic and vinyl chloride resins. the derivatives of cumylphenol which are useful in the invention may be represented by the following formula: emi3.1 wherein r is an acyl group, emi3.2 an alkenyl group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl group having from 7 to 12 carbon atoms; and wherein the r' above is an alkenyl group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms. when r is an alkenyl, the preferred radicals are allyl and methallyl; and when it is aralkyl, the preferred radical is benzyl. most preferably, r' is a phenyl, vinyl or isopropenyl group. still another group of derivatives are the cumylphenol esters of polyfunctional acids. the compounds may be based on both organic and inorganic acids. these materials may be readily pre pared by reacting, for each mole of acid, a number of moles of cumylphenoi equal to the functionality
