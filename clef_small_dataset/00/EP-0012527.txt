<ABSTRACT>
discs (4 und 5) are mounted on a shaft (3) and cables  (6) extend between the peripheries of adjacent discs (4  and 5) for use as ground engaging means.  the shaft (3) and the discs (4 and 5) are rotated in  the same direction as the wheels (2) of the cultivator, but  a different peripheral speed.  as a result of the difference in  peripheral speeds of the wheels (2) and the discs (4 and 5),  the cables (6) are caused to cultivate the ground.  how足 ever, as the discs (4 and 5) are rotated in the same direc足 tion as the wheels (2), any weeds or other material dis足 lodged by the movement of the cables (6) will be carried  rearwardly by the cables (6) and deposited behind the ca足 bles (6), thus avoiding a build-up of unwanted material in  front of the cultivator.

<DESCRIPTION>
rotary cultivators pied of the invention the invention relates to rotary cultivators such as rotary hoes for cutting weeds. in particular, the invention relates to rotary cultivators which are pushed, pulled or otherwise driven by a motorised vehicle such as a tractor background art known rotary cultivators comprise a support structure, at least two wheels mounted on the support structure for rotation about axes which are parallel to an axis extending transversely of the support structure, so as to carry the support structure; a shaft extending on an axis lying in a vertical plane which is parallel to a vertical plane through said transversely extending axis; rotary ground engaging means mounted on the shaft; and drive means for rotating the ground engaging means. in conventional weed-cutting rotary hoes which are driven by motorised vehicles such as agricultural tractors, "l"-shaped knives mounted more or less radially on central hubs or, alternatively, straight blades mounted on a cylindrical drum, parallel to the axis of the drum, are caused to rotate in the same direction as the wheels of the driving vehicle so as to cut through or scrape the earth and pulverise the weeds with the soil. however, in use of these hoes, excessive power is often required because the force supplied to the weeds by the cutting blades acts in the opposite direction to the motion of the hoe so that the momentum of the hoe and the vehicle driving the hoe are not transmitted directly to the weeds being cleared and the blades have to be rotated with a circumferential speed which is greater than the speed at which the hoe is moving along the ground. on the other hand, if the rotary cutter blades are replaced by a non-rotating cutter blade which travels across the soil in a fixed position relative to the driving vehicle, the vehicle speed is limited to the maximum speed allowed by the prevailing conditions and the operator's ability, so that weed cutting becomes a relatively slow, time-consuming operation. moreover, in view of the fixed disposition of the hoe blade relative to the driving vehicle, there can be a continuous build-up of material in front of the scraper blade and, once again, excessive power is required. disclosure of the invention it is therefore the purpose of the present invention to provide a rotary cultivator which can be propelled by a motorised vehicle at relatively high speed, without expending excessive power, in such a way that the cutting or scraping elements of the cultivator are moved relative to the ground at a speed which is closer to the maximum cultivating speed of the cultivator along the ground. this purpose is achieved by modifying a rotary cultivator of known construction so as to provide ground engaging means which comprise a plurality of discs, co- axially mounted on axially spaced parts of the shaft, and a plurality of elongate members which extend between the peripheral margins of adjacent pairs of discs and by mounting these ground engaging means

 claims   1. a rotary cultivator comprising: a support structure (1); at least two wheels (2) mounted on the support structure (1) for rotation about axes which are parallel to an axis extending transversely of the support structure (1), so as to carry to support structure (1); a shaft (3) extending on an axis lying a vertical plane which is parallel to a vertical plane through said transversely extending axis; rotary ground engaging means (4, 5 and 6) mounted on the shaft (3); and drive means (7, 8 and 9) for rotating the ground engaging means (4, 5 and 6); characterised in that:  the ground engaging means (4, 5 and 6) comprise a plurality of discs (4 and 5) co-axially mounted on axially spaced parts of the shaft (3); a plurality of elongate members (6) extend between the peripheries of adjacent pairs of discs (4 and 5); and the rotary ground engaging means (4, 5 and 6) are mounted so#that, in use, the elongate members (6) penetrate the ground to the same depth, throughout their lengths.     2. a rotary cultivator, according to   claim 1,    characterised in that: the shaft (3) extends horizontally; the discs (4 and 5) are of equal diameter and are arranged so that the peripheries of the discs (4 and 5) define planes which extend perpendicular to the axis of the shaft (3); and the elongate members (6) extend along axes which are parallel to the axis of the shaft (3).   3. a rotary cultivator, according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the discs (4 and 5) are rotated in the same direction as the wheels (2), but with a lower peripheral speed.   4. a rotary cultivator, according to claim 3, characterised in that the ratio of the peripheral speed of the wheels (2) carrying the support structure (1) to the peripheral speed of the discs (4 and 5) is between 4:1 and 6:1.   5. a rotary cultivator, according to any preceding claim, characterised in that: the discs (4 and 5) are arranged on the cutter shaft   (3) in pairs; and the elongate members (6) only extend between the discs (4 and 5) of each of said pairs.    6. a rotary cultivator, according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the drive means comprise: a sprocket (7) connected to at least one of the wheels (2); a sprocket (8) connected to the shaft (3); and a roller chain (9) interconnecting the sprockets (7 and 8).   7. a rotary cultivator, according to any preceding claim, characterised in that: the support structure (1) includes a base (10 and 11) and a cross bar (12) pivotally connected to the base (10 and 11) for rolling articulation about a horizontal axis extending perpendicular to the vertical plane through said transversely extending axis; and support means (13) interconnect the shaft (3) and the cross bar (12).
