<ABSTRACT>
the present invention relates to a method for the detec­ tion and/or determination of one or more components of the  reaction between a specific binding protein and the corres­ ponding bindable substance, in which one or more labelled  components are used, that are obtained by coupling particles  of a dispersion of a metal, metal compound or polymer nucleï,  coated with a metal or metal compound, having a particle size  of at least 5 nm, directly or indirectly to the desired component  of said reaction.  during the reaction or after an adequate reaction time, the  physical properties and/or the amount of the metal and or  the formed metal containing agglomerate, is/are determined  in the test sample, or optionally after a separation of the  bound and free metal-labeled components in one of the  derived fractions by methods known by themselves.
