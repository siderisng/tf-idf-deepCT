<ABSTRACT>
apparatus is described for removing pollutant oil and the  like floating on a water surface, comprising: an endless belt  (1) formed of expandible mesh material, and having  oleophilic properties, which belt (1) is provided with drive and  support means (2,4,6) adapted both to support and drive the  belt (1) in a first region at or immediately below the water  surface to pick up pollutant oil and the like on the belt (1) and  to expand the mesh of the belt (1) in a direction at right angles  to the direction of movement thereof in a second region above  the water level to thereby facilitate detachment of pollutant oil  and the like carried by the belt (1).  a method of removing pollutant oil and the like floating  on a water surface is also described, comprising: passing a  belt formed of expandible mesh material, and having  oleophilic properties, through said pollutant oil and the like  with the mesh relatively closed to thereby pick up a portion of  the pollutant oil and the like on the belt; and expanding the  mesh of the belt in a direction at right angles to its direction of  movement at a position remote from the water to facilitate  detachment of pollutant oil and the like carried by the belt.
