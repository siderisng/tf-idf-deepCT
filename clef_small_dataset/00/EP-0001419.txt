<ABSTRACT>
a plant for space heating and hot water on preparation, with a combination boiler (10) and a heat pump (88), wherein the boiler (10) is a first water space (12) heated by a firing (14) and / or a heating insert and communicating with this Second water compartment (26) in which a heat transfer surface (28) is for heating need water. The combination boiler (10) has a third water compartment (34) in which a heat transfer surface (36) for preheating of cold duration water is located. In the third water chamber (34), a circulation (80, 82, 84, 90, 92) is preferably connected in the range of lowest water temperature, which supplied with water to the condenser part (86) of the heat pump (88) and after heating after heating of the water in the second water room (26) can be returned. Finally, the third water compartment (34) is at least with the second water compartment (26).
