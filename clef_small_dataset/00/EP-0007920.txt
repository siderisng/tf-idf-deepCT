<ABSTRACT>
an auxiliary commutation circuit for an inverter com­ prises a pair of oppositely charged capacitors (56, 58) control­ led by separate switches (60, 62), each operable at a particular  time during the conduction cycle of the main thyristors (14,  16) to provide additional stored energy for commutation dur­ ing overcurrent conditions.  a current detector (78) senses the  load current and provides a signal to an auxiliary gate (68)  whenever the rate of change in the load current or its absolute  magnitude exceeds a preselected value.  in response to the  overcurrent signal and a timing signal, the auxiliary gate (68)  renders the appropriate switch operative coupling the  charged auxiliary capacitor in parallel with the primary com­ mutation capacitor (52) so that the combined electrical energy  stored on both capacitors is available for commutation.  after  the commutation period the auxiliary gate (68) maintains the  switch in its open state for a sufficient period of time to allow  the auxiliary capacitor to be recharged.

<DESCRIPTION>
xiliary co#mutation circuit for an inverter this invention relates to inverters and, more particularly, to an auxiliary commutation circuit for assisting in the commutation of the main thyristors of an inverter during an overcurrent condition. inverters are known generally and are devices which transform dc (direct current) electrical energy, such as from a fuel cell or the like, into ac (alternatinc current) electrical energy suitable for use by utility companies or other consumers of electrical energy. most inverters include at least one pair of main switching elements, and by alternatively actuating each switch electrical energy from the dc source flows through the load first in one direction and then in the reverse direction forming a fundamental ac waveform. numerous different types of switching devices can be employed in an inverter to reverse the current through the load. semiconductor switches, such as thyristors, are frequently used in present day inverters and this type of device is typically unidirectional so that the high energy current pulse passes in only one directicn from the input terminal to the output terminal when turned on by a suitable signal applied to its control terminal of the semiconductor switch. some semi- conductor switches, as is known, will not immediately change from a conducting to a nonconducting state upon the removal of â control signal from the control terminal but require that the magnitude of the instantaneous current passing from the input terminal to the output terminal be reduced to zero whereupon the semiconductor switch turns off. the process by which the current is reduced to zero through the semiconductor switch so that it can change from its conducting to its nonconductinc state is known as "commutation" and numerous circuit configurations have been proposed for this function. many commutation circuits operate by presenting a commutation pulse to the load irony a storage device, such as a capacitor or resonant circuit, for a period of greater than the turn off time of the semiconductor switch. since during this period the load current is supplied by the storage device of the commutation circuit, the magnitude of the current through the semiconductor switch drops to zero for a sufficient period to allow transition to the nonconducting state. it is well known in the art that the amount of energy stored in the commutation capacitors is a function of the value or capacitance of such capacitors as well as the voltage impressed thereacross; however, the amount of stored energy required to commutate the main semiconductor switches is proportional to the magnitude of the current therethrough or the load current, i.e. the greater the magnitude of the load current the more stored energy required to commutate the semiconductor switches. accordingly, the value of the commutation capacitor is often selected by ascertaining the highest value of load current which must be commutated and then sizing the commutation capacitor such that the necessary commutation pulse can be provided. a disadvantage of the foregoing method of selection of a commutation capacitor size is that with
