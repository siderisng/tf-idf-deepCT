<ABSTRACT>
an automatic power-driven screwdriver comprises a first  cylindrical member (21) having a hand grip portion, a guide  portion (21a), a tapered portion (21b) and a flanged portion  (21c) between the tapered and hand grip portions.  a second  cylindrical member (24), which is a nose portion of the  screwdriver, is mounted to telescope over the guide portion  (21a).  a third cylindrical member (23) encircles the guide porÂ­ tion and is slidably mounted at one end over the second  cylindrical member (24).  the third member is formed with a  tapered contacting surface complementary to the surface of  the tapered portion (21b) of the first member.  an adjusting nut  (40) having an inwardly extending flange (40a) is mounted on  the first member with the flange being in contact with the  flanged portion (21c) and is threadably engaged with the third  member (23) so that the tapered contacting surfaces are  brought into firm pressure contact which enables the first and  second cylindrical members to be secured firmly together.   however, upon loosening the nut, the nose portion of the  apparatus can be rotated to any desired angular position with  respect to the hand grip portion so that a screw feeder tube  (27), which is connected to the nose portion, can be positioned  to avoid any obstacle which might be present in the area of  use.
