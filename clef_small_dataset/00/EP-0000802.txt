<ABSTRACT>
a driving belt having a trapezoidal cross-sectional configuration  and suitable to transmit a torque between expanding  pulleys formed of pairs of conical discs defining a  v-shaped space between them for receiving the driving belt,  which driving belt comprises a carrier in the form of one or a  number of endless metal belts having a continuous series of  transverse members (6) freely slidable with respect to the  carrier thereon.  in such a driving belt there may be a lateral  vibration of the transverse members under certain conditions.   this vibration, during which the transverse members (6) strike  the carrier, results in wear, which can be considerably  reduced by providing the parallel surfaces with which the  transverse members contact each other with friction-increasing  means, such as a grooved surface.
