<ABSTRACT>
optical sensor apparatus and associated means by  which to color muitiplex optically encoded information  signals over a compact fiber optic transmission system.   the sensor apparatus includes a movable coded masking  means.  the masking means is fabricated with a plurality  of parallel rows, each of which rows comprising a binary  weighted pattern of alternately spaced transparent and  opaque areas.  incident white light is spectrally dispersed,  so that each of the rows of the masking means receives a  respective color.  as the masking means is moved in res足 ponse to an input physical parameter that is to be sensed,  the corresponding binary coded output color signals that  are transmitted through the transparent areas of the mas足 king means are recombined and multiplexed over either a  single optical fiber or a bundle of incoherent optical fibers.   after demultiplexing or spectral dispersion of the multi足 plexed output signal, a photo-detector means is utilized to  receive the individual demultiplexed binary coded output  color signals and to provide a numerical equivalent of the  position of the masking means and, accordingly, the physi足 cal parameter represented thereby.
