<ABSTRACT>
a valve assembly (10) of the type providing bypass flow  through a branch channel (20) when the movable valve  member (40) is in the closed position to block flow through  the main flow channel outlet (16).  a venturi device (44) is  disposed in the main channel (14) upstream of the movable  valve member (40), and the venturi (44) has secondary ports  (58) provided through the wall at the throat section.  when  the movable valve member (40) is in the closed position, flow  into the venturi (44) exits at the flow ports and flows through  the bypass channel (20).  when the movable valve member  (40) is in the open position, flow discharges from the venturi  (44), through the main channel (14) outlet port downstream  of the movable valve member (40), thereby causing reduced  pressure at the venturi throat and preventing flow through  the secondary ports (58) to the bypass channel.
