<ABSTRACT>
a spin tuned magnetron includes a spinner (3) which  interacts with a magnetron cavity to modulate its fre足 quency of oscillation.  the spinner runs in bearings (8, 9)  around a shaft (7).  the lives of the bearings are a control足 ling factor in the life of the magnetron.  the outer races (or) are fixed in position relative to  each other and to the spinner by spacers (13, 14) and a  spring (15) arranged between an abutment (11) and a circ足 lip (12) on the spinner.  the inner races (ir) are arranged to  be moveable relative to each other and to the shaft by vir足 tue of spacers (10) and (17), a spring (16) between the  inner races, and a further spring (18).  a pole-piece nose (4)  is arranged to be screwed down on the shaft to compress  the springs (16) and (18) to provide a desired amount of  axial float on the spinner.  by setting the axial float the  bearing load can be shared as desired and thus increase  the lives of the bearings.
