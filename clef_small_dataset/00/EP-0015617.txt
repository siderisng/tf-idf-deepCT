<ABSTRACT>
a unique and novel mixing device to effect an intense  and rapid mixing of two fluids which is comprised of a  venturi tube (47) connected to the first fluid and a feed  member (48) disposed around the venturi tube (47) through  which the second fluid can flow.  the feed member (48)  has one or more channels (49) which connect with the  venturi tube through which the second fluid can be admixed  with the first fluid.  a baffle (54) is positioned axially opÂ­ posite the exit of the venturi tube (47) to promote additional  mixing.
