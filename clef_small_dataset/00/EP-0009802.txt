<ABSTRACT>
an amorphous silica supported palladium catalyst is  provided which also contains a small amount of an additive  metal compound selected from an oxide, hydroxide and car­ bonate of zirconium, thorium, hafnium, cerium, titanium and  aluminum.  by use of particular preparation conditions and  the amount of additive metal salt raw material used, the  additive metal compound deposits from solution before or  simultaneously with a palladium compound.  the additive  metal compound deposits on the silica support and serves as  a base for the subsequently deposited palladium compound  which is later reduced to palladium metal.  the described  catalyst is particularly suitable as a hydrogenation catalyst in  a cyclic process for the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
pd/sio2 hydrogenation catalyst, the process of preparing the catalyst and its use for producing hydrogen peroxide the anthraquinone process for hydrogen peroxide manufacture employs a cyclic operation in which an anthraquinone is catalytically hydrogenated in solution to a hydroquinone which is then air oxidized to regenerate the quinone and produce hydrogen peroxide. the hydrogen peroxide is separated from the quinone solution by water extraction, and the raffinate is returned to be hydrogenated. palladium is the catalyst of choice for the hydrogenation. it has been commercial practice to use palladium black or palladium on various supports, with a commonly used support being gamma alumina as described in u.s. patent 2,657,980, issued november 3, 1953, to j. w. sprauer. while this catalyst has the advantage of easy preparation and. follows catalyst regeneration by roasting, it has as disadvantages water sensitivity (see u.s, patent 2,867,507) and fairly xapid deactivation under reaction conditions. a more inert material suitable as a support for palladium is silica gel. however, past attempts to produce active and long-lived palladium on silica gel catalysts by slurry techniques, as are used with aluminas, probably failed because the pdc14 anion is not appreciably absorbed by the silica gel, and when precipitated and reduced provided only minor amounts of palladium metal attached to the support. large amounts of free palladium apparently were formed as indicated by the low activity of the supported catalyst as stated in g.s. 2,657,980 (column 2, line 39). various attempts have been made to prepare acceptable pd/si02 hydrogenation catalysts for use in preparing hydrogen peroxide. in u.s. patent 2,940,833, issued june 14, 1960, to lefeuvre et al, a silica gel support was pretreated with sodium bicarbonate prior to -mpregnation with na2pdcl4. in uk specification no. 776,991, insoluble magnesium compounds were pre ciptated on the silica gel prior to impregnation with na2pdcl4. none of these procedures is known to have produced commercially acceptable catalysts. disclosure of the invention according to the present invention there is provided a catalyst consisting essentially of: amorphous silica particles having deposited thereon about 0.05-5 percent by weight based on the weight of silica of at least one oxide, hydroxide or carbonate of a metal selected from zirconium, thorium, hafnium, cerium, titanium, and aluminum and about 0.1-10 percent by weight based on the weight of silica of palladium metal; the metal oxide, hydroxide or carbonate being deposited before or simultaneously with the palladium metal in the form of its oxide, hydroxide or carbonate. also provided is a process for preparing a supported palladium catalyst comprising: (1) mixing a water-soluble, palladium salt, amorphous silica particles and at least one water-soluble salt of a metal selected from zirconium, thorium, hafnium, cerium, titanium, and aluminum in an aqueous medium at a ph less than 4, the amount of said metal salt being sufficient to cause at least a major portion of the palladium present in solution to attach to the surface of the amorphous silica particles when the palladium salt is subsequently precipitated as an oxide, hydroxide or
