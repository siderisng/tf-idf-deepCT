<ABSTRACT>
a fluid energy grinding mill having a hollow vessel (12)  providing a central cylindrical core zone (44) and a peripheral  annular zone (46) both disposed beyond a grinding zone at  one end of the vessel.  carrier medium is injected (at 15) into  the grinding zone to generate a vertically-flowing vortex in  the core zone.  at the other end of the vessel, a first portion of  the flow from the vortex is recirculated in a counter flow  through the annular peripheral zone surrounding the core  zone to interface with new injected carrier medium in a  grinding zone.  a second portion is discharged through a  central opening (26) in the other end of the vessel.  particulate  material is fed into the recirculating flow trough a feeder (35)  so that it may be comminuted in the grinding zone.  in the  vortex, the particulate material is classified by centrifugal  action and the coarse particles are recirculated.  the particles  ground to the desired mass are discharged through an outlet  (22) with the second portion of the carrier medium which is  not recirculated.  several forms of regulation are disclosed  for regulating the upwardly-flowing vortex and the portion of  the flow which is recirculated.
