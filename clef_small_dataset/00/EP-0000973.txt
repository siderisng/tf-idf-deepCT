<ABSTRACT>
a device for heating a liquid for example a central  heating vessel, a boiler and so on, comprising an atmospherically  ignited burner (2) operating for a limited period  of time, a flue gas outlet channel (5) and a wall to be  heated by the flue gases for transmitting heat to the liquid  to be heated, the flue gas outlet channel (5) comprises  a channel portion conducting the flue gases upwards  (51) and a channel portion communicating with  the former and conducting said gases downwards (52),  the heatable wall being arranged both in the upwardly  conducting channel and in the downwardly conducting  channel, so preventing loss of energy due to a draught  through the heating device when being out of operation.
