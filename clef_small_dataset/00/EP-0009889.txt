<ABSTRACT>
a masking device (10) for cropping photographs which  are viewed on a view screen of a photographic printer.  the  masking device (10) allows the operator of the photographic  printer to see exactly what portion of a photograph is being  cropped prior to the printing of the photograph.  the mask  further provides a key (20, 30, 36) for signalling the electronic  system of the printer how much paper should be advanced for  the cropped photograph and correcting the exposure setting  of the printer.
