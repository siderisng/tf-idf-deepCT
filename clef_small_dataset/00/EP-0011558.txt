<ABSTRACT>
a thermoplastic pipe joining method and modular com足 ponents for use therein providing a system of standardized  parts affording flexibility, ease of assembly, and low cost  replacement and repair, especially for use in assembling  submersible underdrain systems to be installed in an acti足 vated carbon adsorber for the purpose of dispensing and/or  collecting industrial wastewater or other liquid material to be  treated by said activated carbon, comprising thermoplastic  pipe pieces having on at least one end thereof a thermoplastic  coupling ring portion (43,44) comprising a flange having one  face flush with the pipe opening and the opposite face having  a tapered cross-section and a thermoplastic, ring-shaped lock足 ing cap (47) in two equal halves (45,46) having an inside  diameter at least as great as the outside diameter of two pipe  pieces to be joined, and having a groove opening onto its  aperture, said groove being of a size and shape to accommo足 date the two coupling ring portions of the pipe pieces when  they are joined, said locking cap being provided with means  for securing the two halves thereof together.

<DESCRIPTION>
title of the invention thermoplastic pipe joining method for modular system background of the invention: field of the invention: the present invention is concerned with a thermoplastic pipe joining method and with modular components for use therein. particularly, the present invention is concerned with a thermoplastic pipe joining method and modular components especially for use in assembling submersible underdrain systems to be installed in an activated carbon adsorber for the purpose of introducing and/or collecting industrial wastewater or other liquid material to be treated by said activated carbon. brief description of the prior art: the victaulic company of america offers a grooved piping method for use with standard steel pipe, cast or ductile iron, lightwall steel, stainless steel and pvc. the method utilizes malleable or ductile iron housing segments and a resilient elastomeric gasket. however, the method also requires that pipe ends being joined have a groove configuration, a requirement considered unacceptable with the thermoplastic pipe to which the present invention is applicable. other pipe joining methods employed heretofore, especially those employed with thermoplastic pipe, have typically employed a system of flanges and gaskets, or have utilized threaded couplings and friction fittings. both such systems require special pipe pieces and can only be assembled and disassembled with some difficulty, whereas the method of the present invention can be adapted to use standard thermoplastic pipe pieces, and permits rapid and troublefree assembly and disassembly. summary of the invention: the thermoplastic pipe joining method of the present invention utilizes a system of standardized parts and affords flexibility, ease of assembly, and low cost replacement and repair. individual components of the system may be easily replaced when they fail without the necessity of replacing major segments of the system, since all pipe joints made by the method of the present invention are not permanent, but rather, may be readily disassembled. thus, there is no need to break permanent joints, with the typical injury to major parts of the system which this might entail, or to replace such major segments of the system due to the difficulty of disjoining various component parts of the system. the method of the present invention is one which also provides quick coupling of pipe pieces and equally rapid disassembly. in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, straight sections of pipe are cut to the desired length anr: then made into a modular part of the system by fusing a coupling ring onto the end thereof. this can be accomplished easily and quickly in the field by making electrical resistance fusion joints. thus, in accordance with the method of the present invention it is possible to assemble any one of a large number of different piping systems, both conveniently and quickly, from a small number of modular components. this means, in turn, great savings in warehousing space and assembly time in the field. the thermoplastic pipe joining method of the present invention utilizes a system of standardized parts, i.e., modular components. these are comprised first, basically, of pipe
