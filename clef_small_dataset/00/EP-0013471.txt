<ABSTRACT>
a papermaker's fabric, for example a dryer felt, a wet felt,  or a forming wire screen fabric, comprises a plurality of  crosswise yarns (12) disposed in a plurality of separate layers,  each of which lies in a plane parallel to the crosswise plane of  the fabric, and a plurality of lengthwise yarns (14) interwoven  with the crosswise yarns (12) to bind the layers of crosswise  yarns (12) together to form a multilayer fabric.  structurally,  the crosswise yarns (12) in a given layer are separated from  the adjacent crosswise yarns (12) in adjacent layers at points  along their length by void spaces (16) within the body of the  woven fabric, and these voids (16) determine the permeability  of the fabric.  the invention proposes to control the void vol­ ume of a papermaker's fabric, hence controlling its permeabil­ ity, by at least partly filling the voids (16) with a synthetic,  polymeric, thermoplastic resin, cellular foam (22).  preferably  the foam is introduced by weaving into the fabric structure a  plurality of stuffer yarns (18) which have been coated with a  a foam forming composition (20), and then causing the com­ position (20) to foam in situ in the fabric.
