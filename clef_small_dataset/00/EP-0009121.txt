<ABSTRACT>
in the repair of pwr type nuclear steam generators  using a remote tooling system, it is necessary to install a  tubesheet indexer on the tubesheet (28) in a known loca­ tion.  the remote docking device (200) is a device for facili­ tating this operation.  it comprises a support plate (202)  with locking devices (204) mounted theron.  the locking  devices are capable of being inserted into the tubesheet for  suspending the support plate therefrom.  a vertical member  is attached to the support plate with an attachment mecha­ nism (222) attached to the vertical member.  a remonte  access manipulator (52) is capable of being attached to the  attachment mechanism so that the vertical member can  position the remote access manipulator so that the remote  access manipulator can be initially attached to the tubesheet  in a well defined manner.
