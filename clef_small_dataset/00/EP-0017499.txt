<ABSTRACT>
apparatus for heating material such as asphalt for filling  potholes in which a drum (12) is rotatable about its axis (13)  and has an outlet opening (15) at one end and a port (17) at  the other end.  an auger (36,37) is mounted within the drum  (12) so that when the drum (12) is rotated in one direction  material is discharged through the outlet opening end (15)  and when it is rotated in the other direction it is moved away  from the outlet opening (15).  a flashback condition burner  (18) is mounted with its discharge opening (18a) in the port  (17) to discharge fully combusted hot gas into the drum to  heat material therein.  the burner can be dismounted to  preheat and clean out a pothole in a road surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
description title: heating apparatus the present invention relates to heating apparatus which is, for example, suitable for heating up road repairing materials. when potholes appear in roadways, it is often advantageous to mend these as soon as is practicable after they are formed. however, this is often very difficult to achieve. the standard technique is for the repairer to obtain a-lorry load of hot asphalt from an asphalt supplier. asphalt consists largely of stones or grit and a binder, usually bitumen, which is between 14 and 17% of the total. the asphalt is taken to the site where the repairs are to be effected. the repairs are carried out on the first few potholes, but after a while the asphalt becomes too cool to be readily usable and it is therefore usually wasted. this is a very wasteful method of operating and is therefore not satisfactory. british patent specification nos. 435,951 and 521,990 describe machines in which aggregate is dried and heated in a drum rotatable about a horizontal axis by means of an oil fired burner, the discharge flame from which is projected into the drum. when the aggregate is hot, the burner is turned down, a door is shut and the bitumen is added. this is a laborious arrangement, does not provide intimate mixing and cannot be used to reconstitute unused asphalt. specification no. 1,353,512 discloses a large scale plant of the type used by an asphalt supplier, which cannot be scaled down for small batch use and could not be used to reconstitute unused asphalt because the bitumen in such asphalt would catch alight. it is now proposed, according to the present invention, to provide a heating apparatus comprising a drum rotatable about its axis, an outlet opening at one axial end of said drum, an auger arrangement within said drum to feed material within said drum axially thereof, a port at the other end of the drum, a flashback condition burner having a combustion chamber in which combustion takes place substantially completely within said combustion chamber, said burner being mounted with its discharge opening in said port and drive means to rotate said arum about its axis selectively firstly in one direction of rotation and secondly in the other direction of rotation. with such an arrangement, the asphalt to be heated can be heated on site and indeed can be mixed at the same time. the material to be heated is fed in to the drum which is rotated in one direction to cause the material to be heated and mixed to flow away from the outlet opening towards the port. when the flashback condition burner is ignited, it produces a high velocity jet of very hot gases which will warm the asphalt sufficiently to make it workable. since combustion is complete in the burner there is no tendency for the bitumen to ignite. indeed the carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the products of combustion which enter the drum, and the very high velocity of the
