<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing multi-free V-belt disks by deformation of a cup-shaped blank of sheet metal.The device operates hydraulically and has molded parts which are fixed at the beginning of the manufacturing process firmly on the blank and when exercising a pressure on the outside on the bottom of the liquid filled blanks independently exposed to each other and without even an axially directed compressive pressure to be exposed.An lowered support body (66) engages over the molded portions (46, 47) and their supports (36, 37) which are arranged radially movable and lockable both with the bottom plate (30) and interlockable.
