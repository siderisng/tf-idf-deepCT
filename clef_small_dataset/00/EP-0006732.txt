<ABSTRACT>
a dipstick is formed of a single length of wire and com­ prises a generally straight main body (32) and a loop-shaped  handle portion (34).  the wire is circular in cross section, rela­ tively small in diameter and possesses a relatively high resi­ lience such that the main body (32) can resiliently flex in all  directions to follow a complexly curved dipstick guiding conduit  (36).  the main body (32) has a pair of axially spaced and radially  projected stopper portions (32a,, 32b).  the handle portion (34)  extends from the main body (32) and terminates in an end (34a)  which is wound round the main body (32) between the stopper  portions (32a,, 32b) such that the end (34a) of the handle portion  (34) is prevented from relative movement in the axial direction of  the main body (32).
