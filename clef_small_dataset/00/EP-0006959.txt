<ABSTRACT>
a method for producing a thin-film coil involves first the  making of a flat coil layer in which counterpart spiral conduc­ tor patterns having the same winding direction are fitted  together so as to obtain adjacent whorls (11, 16), secondly the  making of a further flat coil layer in a similar way so as to  obtain adjacent whorls (28, 40) wound in the opposite direc­ tion, and then placing the second flat coil layer on the first.  the  conductor patterns of the first layer are individually connected  to the conductor pattern of the second layer so as to make up a  coil.
