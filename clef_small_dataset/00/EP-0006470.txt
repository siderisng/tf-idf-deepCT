<ABSTRACT>
A charge coupling memory is given in which a stream of data bits in a shift register consisting of charge coupling elements is inputted, which is connected to a parallel controllable memory, wherein memory locations are defective within the parallel memory.In order to use these defective memory anyway, redundant columns (eg b. C9) are present within this memory, whereby a circuit by short-circuiting or separating defective columns (C5) takes place after a test process during the manufacturing process.For each defective column, a redundant column that has input and output of circuits (I / O) is inserted with the aid of a laser beam into the memory cell matrix, characterized in that gate electrodes are connected to a particular clock phase line (B).
