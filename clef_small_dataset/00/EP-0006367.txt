<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises measuring means of the rotational speed of the motor which comprise a first and a second sensor offset from an angle (α) and a movable mark in front of the sensors, mounted on a said that integral with the shaft. It is characterized in that the means for measuring the speed of rotation further comprise a first programmable divisor countertop (10) whose input is connected to a clock (11) destined to provide it with signals at a frequency (FO). ) and whose output is connected to a counter (13) for counting the signals delivered by the divisor (10), the frequency (FC) of said signals being equal to the frequency (FO) of the clock signals divided by the value of the angle (β) equal to the difference between 360 ° and the angle (α) of deca light between the first and the second sensors (1, 2), the compact (13) being connected in turn to An adrestern input of a memory (18) containing different angle angle values ​​to the ignition, and whose output is related to a second counteractor programmable divider (14) for counting the memorized signals to A frequency (FD) corresponding to a signal per unit angu larger rotation of the engine, and at the end of the discount GE, to procure a signal for actuating means for clenation of the ignition.
