<ABSTRACT>
a high voltage terminal (25) of an ultor capacitance (40)  of a cathode ray tube (21) is coupled to an electron gun  structure (26).  the low voltage terminal (a), which typically  comprises a point on an outer conductive coating (24) on  the cathode ray tube envelope (22) is coupled to a ground  terminal (37) of a spark gap (x-x).  the ground termination for electrical components  and the chassis (36) is also coupled to the group terminal  of the spark gap (x-x).  during arc-over, the cathode ray  tube ultor capacitance discharges through the spark gap  (x-x).  arc-over current oscillations flow in the chassis and  electrical component circuitry by means of stray capacitive  coupling.  current damping means such as a resistor (ri)  is coupled between the chassis (36) and the low voltage  terminal (a) for damping arc-over current oscillation in the  chassis and in the component circuitry.  the current damp­ ing means (ri) may be of such value as to integrate the  voltage across stray capacitance at the frequencies of arc-­ over currents.
