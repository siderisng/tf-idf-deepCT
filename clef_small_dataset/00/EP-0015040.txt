<DESCRIPTION>
this invention relates to a new system for teaching music and to a new electronic device suitable for carrying out and conducting such system. more particularly the invention relates to a new teaching system in which the duty of a music teacher in explaining, demonstrating and exercising the correct correlations between a music lesson on the one hand and music tones or sounds on the other hand, and eventually between music tones and the music notes of said lesson, is taken over by a device establishing automatically such correlations on behalf of the music student. in fact no mechanical or electromechanical provisions are presently known to applicant, carrying out such automatic correlations and providing the music student with direct and automatic information on the correctness of his performances. there are known indeed systems providing a pre-established audiovisual correlation between given sets of music tones and music notes, or systems providing automatically visual representation with respect to tones generated on a music instrument, but none of those known systems allowed for an automatic direct and unequivocal correlation between the musical performances of a music student and a given set of musical tones. the invention now provides a means for such automatic direct and unequivocal correlation between music lessons and the performances of a music student. basically, the system compares the music played by the student with a programmed lesson and gives automatically indications on the errors made by the student. the new music teaching system according to the invention there for establishes a direct and automatic pitch or pitch and rhytm correlation between memory stored sequences of musical tones and/or groups of tones, and student played sequences of musical tones and/or groups of tones, whereby there is provided a visual indication with respect to the memory stored sequence of musical tones and/or groups of tones, as a function of said correlation. the functions thus established and provided in said new music teaching system, may thereby be controlled, carried out and conducted by electronic and/or electromechanical means, which may for instance consist of a device as hereinfurther described also in accordance with the invention. according to the music teaching system of the invention, such electronic and/or electromechanical means will contain in memory one or more reference sequences of musical tones andlor groups of tones, which constitute the lessons to be learned by the music student, such as melodies, tunes, musical scales, etc... there should thereby of course preferably be provided the possibility to change the lessons stored in the memory of the electronic and/or electromechanical means conducting the system of the invention so as to afford unlimited teaching possibilities to said system. in the case of a teaching system according to the invention establishing a pitch and rhythm correlation between the memory stored and student played sequences, there may preferably further be comprised a provision for relative and/or absolute tolerance with respect to the rhythm correlations between the memory stored and student played sequences of tones and/or groups of tones. in a
