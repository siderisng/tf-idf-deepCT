<ABSTRACT>
a phase compatible polymer blend serves as a radiation  sensitive lithographic resist in the fabrication of circuits and  circuit elements.  radiation sensitivity is due to inclusion of a  "modifier".  resist properties, notably stability to agents and  ambients to be masked are attributed largely to a second  component, the "matrix polymer".  in an exemplary embodiment in which the blend is  positive acting, fabrication including dry processing is  dependent upon use of a resist blend of a vapor developing  polysulfone and a novolac.  the novolac, inherently soluble  in alkaline media is rendered insoluble in the blend.  radiation  initiated depolymerization results in volatilization of the  modifier to render the irradiated portions of the resist soluble  in alkaline developers.  modifier may function in other manner; for example, it  may undergo radiation initiated polymerization so as to  insolubilize the blend in irradiated regions, so resulting in a  negative acting resist.  effective isolation of lithographic from masking functions  permits design of blends with high lithographic  sensitivity, as well as good processing stability.  the latter is  sufficient to permit use in many dry processing procedures  as practiced in direct writing, as well as in mask fabrication of  large scale integrated silicon circuits.
