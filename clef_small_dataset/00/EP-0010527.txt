<ABSTRACT>
a prosthesis for limbs, suitable for treatment of the knee,  hip and other joints by prosthesis and for cooperating with  substantially incident (10,111) or substantially coaxial (10,11)  bones or else for treatment of bone fractures, whereby said  prosthesis comprises in mutual cooperation and coordination  at least one axially bored tubular element or sleeve insert (25),  which includes a fitted seating (27, 127) and, at its front,  means (28) to insert it into the bone (10,11) and perhaps to  orient and position it when inserted coaxially with the femur  (10) and tibia (11), and at least one prosthesis element (46,47)  which can be positioned in relation to said fitted seating (27,  127), whereby auxiliary prosthesis means (50) may also be  included and perhaps installed in the hip (111), and whereby  positioning and fixture means (31, 58) are advantageously  present between the bored tubular element (25) and the prosÂ­ thesis element (46,47) and cooperate with said fitted seating  (27,127), and whereby the sleeve insert (25) too is at least  partially inserted in a substantially axial direction into the  bone (10,11), and whereby at least part of the sleeve insert (25)  cooperates with the intermediate tract of the bone or  diaphysis (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
description of the invention entitled nprosthesis for limbs . this inventions concerns a prosthesis for 2 limbs, namely a device suitable for replacing joints which have ceased to function. said invention concerns particularly a prosthe sis for limbs which can be applied not only to the joints of the knee- or the joints of the hip but which can also be used in treatment vf other joints by prosthesis and in the repair and restoration of said other joints. treatment by prosthesis, namely the replacement and repair of joints which are not functioning dell, has eisted for many years. the first prosthesis operations for the hip were carried out in 1951 by mckee and thereafter by .charne3y; they used a cement as a means for fix- ture of the osseous part to the actual prosthesis ifself. the cement used was methyl methacrylate and was prepared and used for the first time by ohorohm in i90i. the good results obtained were soon known all - over the world and so treatment of the hip by pros thesis spread quickly and is apply i nowadays in a very great number of orthopaedic centres. this discovery has enabled many persons suffer ing from arthritis of the hip or affected by fract @res of the neck of the femur to recover the motory activites of the limbs in question quickly and normally. the problems visualized are of two types: one se of problem concerns infections, whereas the type is connected with aseptic detachement of prosthesis caused by microfractures in the cem- s - r o or by the ageing of the latter. -irthermore, there is the problem of removal or -- placement of the prosthesis for the hip or knee, t @e years after it has been applied, owing to the z polymerization of the cement, which has been re to q slime by the time it reaches the opera - - e. the problem of materials has 5een so fully stu nd investigated that nowodays almost the best possible type of material has been found for use in prosthesis, whether said material be a metal or plastic or ceramic, on the basis of ezamination of the wear properties of said materials and their ability to be tolerated by the human body. ot miny years after treatment of the hip by prosthesis had begun, ezperiments were also made with treatment of the knee by prosthesis and there after of other joints as well. the first real prosthesis operations for the knee were carried out by faldius in 1957, and these were followed by prostheses applied by so many other specialists in this field that nowadays ;ere are commercially available about 450 kinds of prosthesis for the knee (bulletin wo.8 of bawmedica). so great a number of prostheses for the @@ee, whether of a hinge type or articulated @@pe or slid ing tuper tuo-compartmental type, meansthat an @d@ed prosthesis for the delicate knee joint in the r:-unan body has still not been realized. this is
