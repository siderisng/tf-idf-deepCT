<ABSTRACT>
a hermetically sealed cell is provided with maximized  volume which is attained by using a terminal (7c) and  terminal insulator (6c) recessed within the cell housing in  combination with a can-within-a-can construction, that is,  one of two parts each comprising a base portion (2c, 5c) and  an upstanding wall (11a, 10a) with the two fitted together to  define a generally cylindrical space (25) with the upstanding  wall (10a) of one (5c) lying within (and sealed to) the  upstanding wall (11a) of the other part (5c); the recessing of  the terminal (7c) and the insulator (6c) thereof being such  (9a) that no part (9) extends from the outer surface of the cell.
