<ABSTRACT>
a door closer of the kind including a tension member (20)  acted on by spring means (26) under the control of a uni­ directionally operative fluid-filled damper which serves to  regulate the rate of movement of a door (d) in the direction of  closure without restricting significantly the rate of movement  in the direction of opening, includes a fluid by-pass (39) in the  damper and operative over the final part of the closure  movement to remove the restraint imposed by the damper,  and means, operative when the closer is installed, to vary the  point in the closure movement at which the fluid by-pass  becomes operative, so as to provide compensation for varia­ tions in the installation of the closer and variations of the gap  between the door and its frame.
