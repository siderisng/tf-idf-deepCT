<ABSTRACT>
anti-protozoal 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives of the for­ mula    where r¹ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy  or nitro; each r² is the same or different in one or more of the  3,4,5 or 6 positions and is hydrogen, lower alkyl, halogen,  hydroxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, amino, substituted  amino, cyano or nitro or two adjacent groups r² together form  a residue -ch=ch-ch=ch-; or r¹ and one r² together form a  residue -ch=ch-ch=ch; r¹ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl,  substituted aryl or a group ar sch₂- were ar is an unsubsti­ tuted or mono, di-or-tri substituted phenyl group where the  substituents are the same or different; and x and y together  form a bond or are each hydrogen; and acid addition salts  thereof, methods for their preparation, formulations thereof  and their use in the treatment of protozoal infections are  described.
