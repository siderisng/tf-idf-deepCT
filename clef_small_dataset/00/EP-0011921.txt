<ABSTRACT>
an electronic organ or the like is provided with a plurality  of large scale integrated circuit (lsi) chips (10-30), each of  which has six tone generators (50) capable of generating a  frequency corresponding to any not on the organ.  in accor­ dance with a preferred embodiment of the invention a suffi­ cient number of these chips (10-30) is provided so that there is  one note generator for each key of the organ.  each chip (10-30)  is assigned to one half octave of the keyboard, whereby out­ puts are in one half octave note groupings.  this allows for  filtering of the square waves generated to provide a very high  quality flute tone.
