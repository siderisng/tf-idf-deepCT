<ABSTRACT>
a close-packed magnetic bubble propagation device  incudes a pattern having a plurality of propagation elements  (40) arranged in at least four adjacent rows (25a, 25b, 27a,  28b).  these elements (40) are spaced to provide a period or  spacing of bubbles in these rows of less than three bubble  diameters.  upon application of a rotating in-plane field (51) to  the elements, bubbles in adjacent rows move in opposite  directions.  a preferred embodiment of this propagation  device has at least two storage loop (24a,24b) which contain  at least four adjacent horizontal rows (25a,25b,27a,27b) of  propagation elements and an access path (46) which passes  through each of the loops.  an electrical conductor (44) is  associated with the propagation elements so that the passing  of a current through the conductor together with the applicaÂ­ tion of the in-plane rotating field (51) to the elements causes  bubbles associated with the elements in the access path to  move along the access path.
