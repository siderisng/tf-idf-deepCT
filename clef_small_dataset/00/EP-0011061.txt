<ABSTRACT>
in this proving chamber (1), two mutually independent conveying devices are provided, whereof the first is intended to receive the tilting pan apparatuses (9) charged with the pieces of dough which are to undergo preparatory proving, and the second the tilting pan apparatuses (9) charged with the pieces of dough which are to undergo the principal proving, each of the conveying devices possessing frames (2,3) for receiving the tilting pan apparatuses (9).  for the purposes of space-saving design and fault-free operation, the receiving frames (2,3), possessing running rails (3',3") for the tilting pan apparatuses (9), are at least twice as wide as the tilting pan apparatuses (9), the receiving frames (2,3) being capable of being raised and lowered independently of each other and possessing devices (7,8) for the horizontal displacement of the tilting pan apparatuses (9) transversely to their direction of insertion.  <image>
