<ABSTRACT>
1.  a speech/noise discriminator comprising n (where n equals at least 3) filtering, detection and integration devices (2-7), centred respectively on n frequencies f1 to fn , in the speech signal band, to supply signals of amplitude af1  (where i=1, 2. . . n, and af1  is a variable function of the signal at the discriminator input), and means of comparison (8-13, 15-20), connected to the n filtration devices, to supply a phoneme recognition signal if the values reached at a given moment by af1  to afn  comply with predetermined criteria, this discriminator being characterized by the fact that the signals afi  are analog signals, and by the fact that the means of comparison comprise n comparators (15-18), each possessing one input (+) to receive the signal af1 , m connecting circuits (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), connected respectively to the m second inputs (-) of the m comparators, each such connecting circuit possessing k input amplifiers (where k is a whole number equal to at least 1, and possibly varying from one connection circuit to the next), each such amplifier being connected to receive one of the signals af2  to afn , and each connecting circuit comprising, for k greater than 1, an output adder with k connected inputs connected respectively to its k amplifiers, and a combinatory circuit comprising an and gate (20) with p inputs (where p is not more than m), connected to the m comparators and, where p is less than m, at least one or gate (19), to connect at least two (17, 18) of the m comparators to the same and gate input, and further characterized by the fact that the and gate output is connected to the discriminator output.
