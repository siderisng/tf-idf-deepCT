<ABSTRACT>
1.  indirectly controlled telecommunications exchange system, in particular telephone exchange system which is equipped with time channel couplers and comprises a control unit (gp1) for which items of information, which originate from a plurality of other swithing devices (ltu1 . . .  ltu8, cp, sesc, tsu, seu), are regularly received in specific time intervals for their further processing, for which purpose the items of information are firstly stored in a buffer store (b) which processes buffer storage locations in assignment to the switching devices (ltu1 . . .  ltu8, cp, sesc, tsu, seu), and consecutive items information which originate from the same switching device (ltu1 . . .  ltu8, cp, sesc, tsu, seu) are compared with one another before, on the basis of changes of information, items of information are further processed by the control unit (gp1), characterized in that of the items of information which are present in time-interlocked time channels individually assigned to the switching devices (ltu1 . . .  ltu8, cp, sesc, tsu, seu), one is received by a register (r) and supplied to a comparator (v), that in this connections, from one storage location of the buffer store (b), which is individually assigned to the relevant switching device (ltu1 . . .  ltu8, cp, sesc, tsu, seu), the corresponding item of information, which has previously been stored therein, is read and is likewise fed to the comparator (v), that when these two items of information are not identical, the comparator (v) effects the storage of the item of information contained in the register (r) both into the read storage location of the buffer store (b) and also into a storage location of a fifo-store (f), that the address of the currently used storage location of the buffer store (b) is stored in this storage location of the fifo-store (f), that items of information and addresses contained in the fifo-store (f) are collected by the master unit (ssp) of the control unit (gp1) in accordance with its operating rhythm for the further processing and fed to a main memory (mu) of the control unit (gp1), and that the addresses of storage locations of the buffer store (b) are converted into addresses of storage locations of the main memory (mu) with the aid of a converter.
