<ABSTRACT>
a double layered yarn having a sheath and core structure  is prepared through a roving process, drawing process or fine  spinning process.  the sheath portion of the yarn is composed  of staple fibers (a) which have a high thermal shrinkage in  boiling water of at least 5%, and the blended fiber ratio of  which is between 50% and 25%.  the core portion of the yarn is  composed of staple fibers (b) which have the property of  being spontaneously extensible, and the blended fiber ratio of  which is between 25% and 75%.  the double layered yarn is  subjected to a heat treatment in hot water, and a bulky spun  yarn which comprises staple fibers (a) and (b) is obtained.  the  staple fibers (a) are concentrated toward the inside of the  bulky spun yarn after they are shrunk.  the ends of staple  fibers (b) are held within the inside of the bulky spun yarn, and  the intermediate portions of fibers (b) bulge as loops from the  body portion of the bulky spun yarn, after the fibers (b) are  spontaneously extended.
