<ABSTRACT>
insoluble electrodes which are especially useful in the  electrowinning of nickel in particular comprising an electri­ cally conducting substrate, a barrier layer on the substrate, an  electrodeposited ruthenium-iridium intermediate layer which  is partially oxidized and an outer layer containing ruthenium  dioxide.  the ruthenium-iridium layer can usefully be elec­ trodeposited from an aqueous bath containing a soluble  ruthenium compound, a soluble iridium compound, a soluble  fluorborate salt and fluorboric acid.  a preferred iridium com­ pound for use in the bath is one prepared by refluxing a  diammonium hexahalo salt of iridium and sulphamic acid in  aqueous solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
insoluble electrodes incorporating a precious metal alloy layer and baths and bath oonstituents for the electmxiscsition of precious metal alloys this invention relates to insoluble electrodes and also to processes for the production of ruthenium-iridium electrodeposits which are particularly useful in the production of the electrodes. the electrodes of the present invention are particularly, but not exclusively, suited for use as insoluble anodes in the electrowinning of nickel and the description below is mainly concerned with such a process. however, the electrodes may also be employed for the electrowinning of other metals, e.g., copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt, cadmium, gallium, indium, and alloys thereof, e.g., nickelcabalt alloys, and for other processes, e.g., for the electrolytic production of chlorine from brines, the dissociation of water, cathodic protection (e.g., in seawater or underground) and for battery electrodes. for environmental reasons there has been much interest in using electrochemical techniques for extracting metals from ores. however one of the major problems associated with the electrowinning of metals concerns the development of satisfactory anodes. they must be good electrical conductors and resistant to chemical attack in the environment in which they are used; in addition they must be sufficiently strong to withstand normal handling in commercial use, and they must be effective for the desired reactions at the anode without interfering with the activity at the cathode. economic factors such as the cost of the anodes, their durability and the power requirements associated with their use must also be considered. in a typical nickel electrowinning process using insoluble anodes described by j.r. boldt in "the winning of nickel", pp. 362-374 (1967), the electrolyte used is a purified leach liquor, which is essentially an aqueous solution of nickel sulphate, sodium sulphate and boric acid, and the anodes are made of rolled sheets of pure lead. the principal cathodic reaction is: emi2.1 the principal anodic reaction, leading to the release of oxygen, is: emi2.2 lead and lead alloys have also been used as anode materials for electrowinning of metals other than nickel, e.g., copper and zinc. however lead has not been an entirely satisfactory anode material although lead alloys are often mechanically stronger and more resistant to certain corrosive -environments used in electrowinning processes than pure lead; their operating potential is substantially higher than that of precious metal coated titanium anodes, and there is the ever present possibility of cathode lead contamination, because at open circuit lead dissolves and can then be deposited at the cathode. overall, very few material may be used effectively as anodes, especially in oxygen producing environments, because of the severe conditions. graphite has been used - and its limitations are well known. in recent years there has been considerable interest in replacing graphite electrodes used in the electrolytic production of chlorine from brines with platinum group metal-coated anodes. in general anodes of this type comprise metal substrates which are corrosion resistant and ;which possess high melting points and good electrical conductivity and which passivate in that they form protective surface films in
