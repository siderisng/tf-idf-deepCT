<ABSTRACT>
pile fabric (10) with thermoplastic pile is fed beneath  a radiant heater (14), preferably with the pile brushed back  by a brush (40).  the pile is pulled back over a blade (16)  so as to contact a cool pattern roller (18) having rows of  thin blades in longitudinal slots at its periphery.  the blades  pattern the softened pile which is then set by the cool rol­ ler and air jet (32) directed on the back of the fabric.  the  fabric itself rotates the roller which may be braked (fric­ tion brake 34, 36, 38).  the apparatus and the method em­ bodied in the apparatus can produce a stria pile fabric  simulating a fabric produced with slubbed yarns.  however  the invention can be used whether the fabric is woven,  tufted or knitted.
