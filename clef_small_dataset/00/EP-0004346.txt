<ABSTRACT>
this specification relates to a box beam (20) with  upright sides (22) which are connected to upper and lower  chord plates (24, 26) all of which are constructed of corrugated  plate having corrugations (28) which run parallel  to the length of the box beams and which have a large  corrugation pitch and depth.  the chord plates (24, 26)  and sides (22) are bolted together at spaced apart intervals.   thin-walled shear plates (30) are placed against the  box beam sides (22) and bolted to the corrugation troughs  (38) of the sides and they carry vertically acting shear  loads while their connection to the box beams (20) prevents  them from buckling.  a longitudinal camber can be  incorporated in the box beam.  the box beam is specifically  adapted for use in a structure such as a building or bridge  and several embodiments of the latter are described utilising  one or more beams arranged side by side.  a load carrying  deck (52) constructed of corrugated checkered metal  plate is supported on the deck and a concrete layer (60)  is poured on top of the bridge deck (52) so as to form a  mechanical interlock between the concrete and the deck  to thereby structurally integrate the concrete layer with the  remainder of the bridge.
