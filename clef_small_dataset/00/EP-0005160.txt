<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a new pine photodiode formed of a semiconductor microplaquette having a plane and thick plane region separated from a region N flat by a region I flat and thin, comprising means (21) providing the direct admission ofThe light energy to the region I in a direction parallel to the plane orientation of the region I and electrically conductive means (22) and (23) in contact with the P and N regions to ensure the connection of the PIN photodiode to theElectronic circuits formed on said semiconductor microplaquette or any other similar element.This arrangement makes it possible to obtain a high response in a wide range of light wavelengths, thanks to the large dimension of the region I in the direction of the incident light, while maintaining a reduced transit time thanks to the small thicknessof this same region i.
