<ABSTRACT>
an antigenic protein, termed antigen a, present on the  cell walls and in cultures of streptococcus mutans, especially  genetic group i (serotypes c, e and f) is separated from other  antigenic proteins, notably those which cross-react with  heart tissue, to give an antigenic preparation which may be  used as a vaccine or to raise antibodies for use in protecting  against dental caries.  antigen a is one of two major antigenic proteins remainÂ­ ing on cell walls of s.  mutans genetic group i after extraction  with a boiling 10 g/l litre aqueous solution of sodium  dodecyl sulphate for 20 minutes.  it has a molecular weight of  about 29,000, an isoelectric point of 4. 1 to 4. 5.  its amino-acid  analysis is also given.  the antigen also occurs in the culture filtrate and/or cell  extract and may be readily purified from these sources by,  for example fractional ammonium sulphate precipitation  and/or affinity chromatography on immobilised antibody.  pharmacological or dental preparations containing the  antigen preparation or abtibodies thereto.
