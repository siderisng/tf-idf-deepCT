<ABSTRACT>
a film strip handling mechanism for a photographic  printer, which printer has a scanning gate (21) and a printing  gate (22), includes a locator detector (29) which is transversely  displaceable with the film strip (10).  the detector (29) is  supported by a trsnsversely displaceable support having a  guide means (24,25) for contacting an edge of the film.  as the  film strip (10) wavers transversely in its movement the guide  means (24,25) causes the detector (29) to move with it,  thereby keeping the detector (29) aligned with locators on the  strip (10).
