<ABSTRACT>
For electrically connecting a plurality of densely close to each other of a display of a display (1) with a printed circuit board (20), flexible printed circuit boards (9, 10, 13) are provided, each of which is associated with a certain number of display terminals.The distance of the conductor tracks to each other increases with increasing distance from the display (1) to a predetermined printed circuit board standard (16).Such a connection allows a particularly space-saving design of the printed circuit board with which the display is to be connected and is also easily manufacturing bar.
