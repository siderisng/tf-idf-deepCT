<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a shaving apparatus comÂ­ prising a drivable cutting unit with cutters, each cutter  being equipped with a lead cutter which leads in the  direction of driving and which is movable relative to the  cutter.  the lead cutters serve to slightly pull the hairs, so  that a better shaving result can be obtained.  the distance  over which the hairs can be moved is limited by the shape  and dimensions of the cutter and the lead cutter and by  the properties of the hairs and the skin.  it is the object  of the invention to eliminate this restriction and this leads  to a construction in accordance with which each cutter,  in addition to the said first lead cutter, is equipped with  a second lead cutter which leads relative to the first lead  cutter and which second lead cutter is movable relative to  the first lead cutter.

<DESCRIPTION>
shaving apparatus. the invention relates to a shaving apparatus comprising a drivable cutting unit with cutters, each cutter being equipped with a lead cutter, which leads in the direction of driving and which is movable relative to the cutter. such a shaving apparatus is for example known from netherlands patent application 7404 657 (phn 7351). the lead cutters serve to slighly pull the hairs, so that a better shaving result can be obtained. the distance over which the hairs can be pulled is limited by the shape and dimensions of the cutter and the lead cutter and by the properties of the hairs and the skin. it is the object of the invention to eliminate this restriction and this leads to a construction which is characterized in that each cutter, in addition to the said first lead cutter, is equipped with a second lead cutter which leads relative to the firt lead cutter and which second lead cutter is movable relative to the first lead cutter. a special embodiment is characterized in that each cutter is provided with more than two lead cutters, each second and further lead cutter being movable relative to an adjacent preceding lead cutter. the invention is also embodied by a cutting unit as used in one of the embodiments described in the foregoing. the invention will now be explained by means of a description of an embodiment shown in the figures. figure 1 is an elevation of a shaving apparatus having three shear plates, figure 2 shows the shaving apparatus of fig. 1 in side view and partly in a cross sectional view taken on the line ii-ii in fig. 1, figure 3 shows the cutting member with lead cutters in perspective, figures 4, 5 and 6 illustrate the operation of the lead cutters, the shaving apparatus in accordance with figures 1 and 2 comprises a housing 1, of which a part takes the form of a shear plate holder 2 for three shear plates 3. the shear plates 3 are formed with hair-entry apertures 4. as is shown in the partial cross-section of fig. 2 a cutting unit 5 is situated on the inner side of a shear plate 3. this cutting unit 5, which for the sake of clarity is only shown schematically in fig. 2, comprises a cutting member with cutters and lead cutters, and is shown in perspective view and on an enlarged scale in fig. 3. the cutting unit 5 is coupled to the electric motor 10, by means of the hollow spindle 6 (fig. 2), the gear wheels 7 and 8 and the spindle 9, so that the cutting unit is rotatable relative to the associated shear plate 3o the gear wheel 7 is rotatably journalled on a pin 11, which is mounted in a mounting plate 12. the gear wheel 7 is formed with a recess 13, which is closed by a cover plate 14. this recess acconimodates the flange 15 at the end of the hollow spindle
