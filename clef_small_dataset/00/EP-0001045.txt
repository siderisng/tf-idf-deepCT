<ABSTRACT>
1.  an adjustment device for a partially-enclosed disc brake for motor vehicles or trailers, of which the brake pad carriers are arranged on both sides of a brake disc and are displaceably mounted on tubular support pins mounted in a support secured on the axle body in the plane of the brake disc and are actuated by draw rods arranged within the support pins, which are supported directly at one end on an inner brake pad carrier and at the other end cooperate with a respective brake lever, characterised in this that each brake lever (14, 14') is pivotally mounted about a shaft (15) extending parallel to the outer brake pad carrier (9) and mounted on a draw nut (12) secured to the draw rod (6) and has a cam (30) for operating the outer brake pad carrier (9) and that between the cam (30) and the outer brake pad carrier (9) an adjustment ring (16) is displaceably arranged, against the action of a compression spring (17) on the draw nut (12), which cooperates with adjustment members (20) which are radially adjustable and engageable with compression springs (19) on steps (18) machined in the end wall of the adjustment ring (16).
