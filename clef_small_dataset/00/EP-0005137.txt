<ABSTRACT>
Closing bodies for breakthroughs on building walls, such as door, window and ventilation openings, are to be equipped with an actuator designed so that at least the closing process of the closure bodies is immediately interrupted at risk of clamping. As a safety actuator, therefore, a self-terminating single-phase AC synchronous motor (25) is used, which moves the closure member (21) on the one hand between two predetermined end positions (29 ', 29 ") back and forth. Each of the two end positions is embeddable by switches (26, 28). On the other hand, the closing process of the closure bodies, in whose impact on an obstacle, for example a person, without additional switching means is automatically interrupted to avoid the risk of clamping. The interruption of the closing operation for the closure members (21) takes place alone due to the peculiar operating characteristic of the single-phase AC synchronous motor (25).
