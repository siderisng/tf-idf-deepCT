<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing pressing strings of metal powder, wherein the pressings are to be further processed by forming machining, such as rollers or forging. The metal pulse VER is filled in a metal capsule (1), which is subsequently closed. The capsule (1) is then heated to a temperature in which a binding of the powder grains is possible with each other. According to the invention, the hot capsule (1) is inserted into the mold compartment of a press, wherein the molded space is formed from the wall of a cylinder (7) and the pressure stamps (13, 16) projecting in the cylinder. between the capsule and the walls of the mold compartment is a layer (21, 25) of a thermal insulating and pressure-transmitting solid material, such as talc, which is capable of preserving the pressing process on the cylindrical walls of the pressing radial printing radial pressure exert.
