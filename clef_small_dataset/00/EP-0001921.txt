<ABSTRACT>
a device for removing a solder alloy from a solid  soldered joint comprising a multiplicity of metallic strands  formed into an elongated wick operable to effect the solder  removal through the application of an end portion thereof to  the joint in heat exchange relation to a heat source so that  when the solder alloy is rendered molten by the heat source  it will flow by capillary action from the joint into the applied  end portion of the wick, the device being improved in that  each metallic strand 12 of the wick has its exterior surface  coated with solidified solder alloy 14 having a melting point  substantially below the melting point of tin prior to being  formed into the wick so that when the end portion thereof is  applied to the joint in heat exchange relation with the heat  source as aforesaid the solid solder alloy of the coating on  the strands of the applied end portion when rendered molten  by the heat source mixes with the molten solder alloy from  the joint flowing by capillary action into the applied end  portion of the wick.
