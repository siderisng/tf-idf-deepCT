<ABSTRACT>
the invention provides a method an apparatus for  refinishing a brake disc (2).  the brake disc (2) is rotated,  and brought into contact with two opposed abrading discs  (34, 35), which are rotated as well, thereby grinding the  brake disc (2).  this can be carried out if desired with the  brake disc (2) still in situ on a vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
a method an apparatus for grinding vehicle brake discs this invention relates to a method of grinding brake discs and to a machine for the regrinding of brake discs which form a portion of disc brakes. disc brakes are widely used on motor vehilces, particularly automobiles. generally such brakes have a disc attached to the vehicle wheel to be breaked, and brake shoes which approach the opposite sides of the disc when braking is desired, and engage the disc, whereby to slow the wheel through friction. the brake shoes suitably have brake linings of asbestos or other high-friction material, whereas the disc itself is usually a suitable metal, which will dissipate the heat of friction rapidly and which will be sturdy during operation. during the operation of a motor vehicle, brake discs frequently become contaminated by such material as oil and grease, or they may become rusty. oil and grease reduce the friction between the brake shoes and the disc, and may cause the brakes to fail to function when they are needed. rust, on the other hand, may increase the friction, causing the brake to seize or "grab". in order to remove rust and contamination, and assure that the disc surface is smooth so as to be suitable for gripping the brake shoes, regrinding of brakes discs is often necessary. thus, a large industry has developed to regrind brake discs. generally, the regrinding of brake discs is done in machine tools, which require the brake discs to be removed from the vehicle for the regrinding process. some devices require the further disassembly of the disc from the wheel hub with which it is associated, whereas others, such as, for example, that shown in canadian patent 815,782 issued june 24, 1969 to ammco tools inc., permit the disc to be reground while still attached to the wheel hub, after the wheel hub is removed from the vehicle. some devices such as that shown in canadian patent 865,769 of fmc corp. require a two-stage process, which a first turning step on a lathe and a second, grinding step. in that patent a free-rotating grinding wheel, mounted on a universal mounting, is used to finish the surface of a disc after grinding. such devices are frequently very expensive, and require a high capital investment by shops wishing to use them. additionally, the time taken to disassemble the wheel from the vehicle prior to regrinding leads to delay and high cost for the regrinding operation. because of the disadvantages of requiring disassembly of the wheel from the vehicle, several attempts have been made to develop a machine which would regrind the wheel discs while they are still in place on a vehicle. west german published patent application 2,316,672 of the present inventor, which was published on march 28, 1974,shows one such proposal. another generally similar proposal is shown in u. s. patents 3,521,411 and 3,590,537 of hennig and kammermayer. experience with devices such as those shown in the german published application and u.

<CLAIMS>
 claims    1. a method of regrinding a vehicle brake disc characterized by:  a) rotating the brake disc about a first axis, and  b) while rotating the brake disc placing two opposed rigid abrading discs, each having an abrading face, so that the abrading face is in frictional contact with a face of the brake disc, whereby to grind the brake disc, while rotating the brake disc.    2. the method as claimed in claim 1, carried out while the brake disc is in situ on a vehilce axle.    3. a method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which each abrading disc present is caused to rotate only through contact with the rotating brake disc.    4. apparatus for grinding brake discs, characterized by two rigid abrading discs with abrading faces in face-to-face relation and movable towards and away from one another, each disc being mounted for rotation about an associated axle, each axle being perpendicular to the abrading face of its disc, means for positioning the abrading discs with their abrading faces in face-to-face contact with a brake disc placed between them, and means for holding the abrading discs, when so positioned, in frictional contact with the brake disc.    5. apparatus as claimed in calim 4, characterized in that the means for positioning the abrading disc includes a mounting bracket which attaches to the brake caliper mounting.   of a motor vehicle.    6. apparatus as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5, in which the means for positioning the abrading disc is adapted to position each such disc with its axis of rotation outside the periphery of the brake disc to be reground.    7. apparatus for regrinding a brake disc in situ on a vehicle axle, characterized by:  a base member,  two relatively movable supporting members upstanding from said base member,  journal means mounted on each of said supporting  members,  a stub axle journalled in each of said journal means,  an abrading disc fixedly mounted at the end of each stub axle for rotation therewith, each abrading disc having a first face and a second face, each of which is perpendicular to its respective stub axle, the stub axle joining the disc in the centre of the first face, the second face being coated with abrasive material, and the first face not being coated with abrasive material,  the said two abrading discs being oriented with their respective abrasive faces in face-to-face relationship to one another,  bearing means mounted to support said abrading discs and means for adjustably urgin said discs towards one another.     8. apparatus as claimed in claim 7, in which the axes of rotation of the two abrading discs are substantially parallel to one another, but are adjustable with respect to one another so that they may be adjusted to deviate slightly from parallel to one another.    9. apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8, additionally including,  positioning means for retaining said apparatus in juxtaposition with a vehicle brake disc in situ on a vehicle, with the abrasive faces of the abrading discs held in frictional contact with opposite sides of the wheel disc and overlapping a portion thereof.    10. apparatus as claimed in claim 9, in which said positioning means includes,  means for removably and adjustably attaching said base member to the caliper bracket of a vehicle disc brake unit.
