<ABSTRACT>
a fuse holder for a miniature cartridge fuselink, com­ prises a hollow body (1) and a fuse carrier (2), formed as  plastic mouldings, and two spring metal contact members (4)  engagable with the outside of the body and having central  parts (14) which project into the cylindrical chamber (5) of the  body through slots (11) in the body wall.  the construction is  such that the fuse carrier can only be inserted into the body  when it is oriented in one predetermined position relative to  the body and, in this position, there are barriers (33) of insula­ tion material between the end caps of a fuselink snapped into  the carrier receptacle (19) and the potentially live electrical  terminals (4) on the body.  when the fuse carrier is fully  inserted into the body, it can be rotated through one half turn  to engage the end caps of the fuselink with the contacts (4).   the fuse holder prohibits a user from touching any live termi­ nals and the end caps of the fuselink cannot engage the  contacts of the holder whilst the fuselink is being inserted into  or removed from the holder.
