<ABSTRACT>
a photoconductive drum (22) is formed with first and  second photoconductive layers of different spectral sensitivities.   first and second chargers (12), (14) apply electrostatic  charges of opposite polarities to the drum (22) to form a  stratified charge pattern.  radiation of a light image onto the  drum (22) causes electrostatic images to be formed in the  layers according to color, the net surface potential being  negative in areas corresponding to one color such as red,  positive in areas corresponding to another color such as black  and zero in white background areas.  first and second developing  units (27), (28) apply positively charged red toner and  negatively charged black toner respectively to the drum (22)  to form a two color toner image.  when only one charger (12),  (14) and only one developing unit (27), (28) is actuated for  operation, a positive or negative copy in either color may be  produced.  the copying machine (21) is operative in either of  five copying modes merely by selectively actuating the chargers  (12), (14) and developing units (27), (28) in correspondingly  different combinations.
