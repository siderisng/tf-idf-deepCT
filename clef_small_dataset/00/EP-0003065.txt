<ABSTRACT>
In a method for obtaining potassium chloride from Sylvinit or Sylvinity density materials, the starting materials with mother liquor of the crystallization stage are heated hot, which is substantially separated from sodium chloride and crystallized potassium chloride by cooling the solution. In order to avoid potassium chloride losses and to reduce the material problems available so far in the separation of water-insoluble contaminants, such a method that is a) precipitates the roughly prevented starting materials; b) the finely grounded starting material at ambient temperature with a sodium chloride and potassiumchlo ​​ridge saturated solution is mashed and water-insoluble impurities flooded with the solution; c) the solution separates from the water-insoluble contaminants and at least partially returns to the preparation of mash in step (b); d) released from water-insoluble impurities, substantially potassium chloride and sodium chloride-containing salt porridge according to (b) with a saturated on sodium chloride and potassium chloride, such as a solution derived from the crystallization stage, which results in a suspension of a temperature of at least 95 ° C. ; e) The residue-containing residue separating from the predominantly sodium chloride and strengthened solution to potassium chloride by adding potassium chloride into practice and f) brings the solution according to (e) for crystallization.
