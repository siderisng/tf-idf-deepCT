<ABSTRACT>
In a manipulator arrangement, for compensating the heavyweight forces, which act on the parts of the gripping arm device (12, 14, 20, 22, 24) and on the objects taken by the gripping in g (18), a pneumatic cylinder / piston arrangement (48) Provided by which a controllable counterforce can be generated.The pneu matic cylinder / piston arrangement is supplied by an air pressure regulator (56) air with selectable pressure.The air pressure regulator is set by means of a servo drive system (102), which in turn receives control signals from one, computer (10) in which the object weights occurring in a working process are stored one after the other, and the gripping arm weight to be compensated, and successively for generating control signals for the servo drive systembe used.
