<ABSTRACT>
a backing sheet with the usual punched heading carries a stencil sheet composed of a conventional tissue layer to which an ink-impermeable coating is attached by a layer of adhesive.  an electrophotographic toner image formed on the backing sheet is bonded to the impermeable coating of the stencil sheet such that when the assembly is mounted on a duplicating machine and the body of the backing sheet stripped off it forms the stencil by removing parts of the impermeable layer.  the stencil sheet is attached to the heading by a line of heat and/or pressure sensitive resin, preferably the toner which also forms the image.  the assembly is thus easily produced from preformed backing and stencil sheets in a modified electrostatic copying machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
duplicating stencil assembly the present invention relates to a duplicating stencil assembly comprising a backing sheet and a stencil sheet attached to the backing sheet, the backing sheet comprising a heading region at one margin of the sheet which is separable from the body of the sheet and to which the stencil sheet is attached. such stencil assemblies are conventional and are used for the production of duplicating masters by typing a text onto the stencil sheet while supported by the backing sheet. the stencil sheet is commonly composed of a coated tissue which is flimsy and easily damaged. the backing sheet provides support for the stencil sheet until it is mounted on a duplicating machine. for this purpose the heading region of the backing sheet has punchings to fit on to projections on the duplicating machine. upon mounting of the stencil sheet on the machine the body of the backing sheet is separated, commonly by tearing along a line of perforations, and removed. various methods have been proposed for replacing the typing of the stencil sheet, or the use of a stylus, by a procedure which enables a whole document to be automatically reproduced in the form of a stencil. at present however there are only two systems commercially available for the non-manual production of stencils. the first process involves the electrical cutting of a carbon-loaded layer on a porous stencil sheet. a spark discharge cutting-head is synchronised with an optical head which views the original and directs the cutting-head to cut the stencil, point by point. this system produces good results but is relatively slow, requiring a period of 5 to 15 minutes to complete, and since the process involves burning off the carbon loaded regions it is dirty and produces an unpleasant odour. the second process is a thermographic process known as "thermal imaging". it uses a stencil master consisting of porous tissue with a thin thermoplastic coating which is placed against the original document and heated by an infra-red lamp. the termperature rise of the coating is greatest in the black image areas and it melts in these areas to expose the porous tissue and thus produce a stenc 1. ,he process is very quick, the exposure time being of the order of 10 seconds, but it requires practice and skill to determine the length of exposure. the resolution is poor and the process is blind to many colours of the original, including some blacks. there is also a risk of damage to the original. in our cc-pendingt pplication no. 7926290 we have described and claimed a stencil sheet for the production of a stencil from an electro-photographic image by bonding the image to the stencil sheet and then tearing away parts of the stencil sheet adhering to the image, the stencil sheet comprising a porous tissue sheet, an inkimpervious layer comprising a synthetic resin composition containing finely-dispersed zinc oxide, and an adhesive bonding the ink-impervious layer to the porous tissue sheet in accordance with the

claims;   1. a   duplicatims    stencil assembly comprising a backing sheet and a stencil sheet attached to the backing sheet, the backing sheet comprising a heading region at one margin of the sheet which is separable from the body of the sheet and to which the stencil sheet is attached, the stencil sheet comprising a tissue layer with an ink-impermeable coating secured to the tissue by an adhesive layer, the body of the backing sheet having a toner image formed thereon which is bonded to the impermeable coating of the stencil sheet in such a manner that upon separation of the stencil sheet from the backing sheet parts of the impermeable layer are removed by the image to form a stencil, and the stencil sheet being attached to the heading region of the backing sheet by a line of heat and/or pressure sensitive resin.    2. a duplicating stencil assembly as claimed in claim 1 in which the line of resin is composed of the same material as the toner image.   3. a method of producing a duplicating stencil assembly as claimed in claim 1 in which the stencil sheet is attached to the heading region of the backing sheet in the course of the same heat and/or pressure treatment which is used to bond the toner image on the body of the backing sheet to the impermeable layer of the stencil sheet.   4. a method as claimed in claim 3 in which the line of resin for attaching the stencil sheet to the heading region is formed simultaneously with and from the same material as the toner image.
