<ABSTRACT>
a protein-containing product is processed from a  protein source, e. g.  an acid or sweet whey or from another  protein source such as soy beans, with the addition of a  component to a proteinaceous liquid.  to produce products  having a bland taste, which have lost much of the odor  characteristic of the protein source, and which are there­ fore suitable for incorporation into food products, the pro­ teinaceous liquids subjected to blending shear forces while  being maintained at above a predetermined temperature  and a blandness imparting component and a colloid en­ hancer component are incorporated during the shearing.   the resultant product has generally colioidal properties  and so is readily flocculated into two fractions separable  from each other by a simple decanting procedure.
