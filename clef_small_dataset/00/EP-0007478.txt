<ABSTRACT>
an insulating covering for parallel bus bars such as of the  kind used for making electrical connections between other  bus bars is provided with longitudinal bulbs (3a, 3b, 4a, 4b)  such that two or a pluraliry of bus bars (1) with insulations (2)  disposed side by side may be mutually interlocked (against  the influence of transverse forces).

<DESCRIPTION>
insulation for parallel bus bars the invention relates to an insulating covering for parallel bus bars such as of the kind used for connecting other bus bars. bus bars are usually flat or sectioned and are primarily used in cabinets for electrical distribution. when dimensioning such bus bars, which run in parallel, due account must be taken not only of the purely mechanical forces, but also of the electromagnetic forces which arise between two parallel bus bars carrying a current. with regard to these electromagnetic forces, it is necessary when dimensioning the bus bars to make allowance for the maximum forces possible, such as those which develop in cases of short circuits. the electromagnetic forces between two parallel bus bars are proportional to both the square of the current and to the length of the bus bars. they play a vital role in cases of short circuits and it is important that the bus bars are not deformed and that the supports for the bus bars do not fracture. given a short circuit current, one has to determine the electromagnetic forces for every bus bar length and distance between supports. a solution to these problems has been disclosed in u.s; patent 2,969,421, which describes a bus bar comprising an elongated, preferably extruded member with a cross section including a rectangular body section and a locking element. the locking element has a dimension, taken along a line parallel to the juncture line between the body section and locking element, which is greater than the dimension of the juncture line. a locking groove is cut into the body section to enable it to receive the locking element of a second bus bar. the locking groove is of substantially the same shape as the locking element but is made slightly larger so that it can also receive a member which insulates the bus bars from each other. the bus bar described in the cited patent, however, has the following disadvantages: the interlocking which is effected by sliding the elements lengthwise with respect to each other has to be performed with great care because of the relatively thin insulating member which has the dimensions of an insulating foil and which has to stay in place during and after assembly. furthermore, the creepage distance is defined largely by the amount of insulating foil protruding between adjacent bus bars. it is an object of the invention to provide a bus par which can interlock to give the resulting advantages and at the same time provide possibilities for changing conductor material without the need to resort to specially extruded profiles. furthermore, it is desired to have creepage distances which are at least as good as in the cases where individual bus bars are supported by conventional supports. the insulating covering according to the invent is characterized in that the insulation is provided with longitudinally extending slots and bulbs in order that two or a plurality of bus bars disposed side by side may be interlocked (against the
