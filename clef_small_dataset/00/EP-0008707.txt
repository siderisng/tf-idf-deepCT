<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a directional coupler which is designed for a housing mounting, which consists of two direction couplers executed in two on opposite surfaces of a dielectric carrier plate (1), which is connected to each other coupled together, which is formed as a microstrip line. A directional coupler is to be created, which has high directional sharpness with high coupling attenuation, large voltage resistance and insensitivity of these properties from the housing installation. The invention provides an embodiment of the second transmission line as a coplanar line having a strip conductor (5) which inserts on the mass side of the microstrip line in a free area (4) of the ground conductor surface (3) and substantially parallel and approximately opposite to the strip conductor (2) the microstrip line is guided. An inventive directional coupler can always be used when the requirement consists of a horizontal coupler with higher coupling damping, e.g. b. in VSWR monitoring in secondary radars.
