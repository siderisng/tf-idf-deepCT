<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an electrical connector into slotted  plate terminals of which, wires can be inserted axially so  that the housing of the connector need not be designed to  allow lateral insertion of the wires into the terminals.  as  shown in figure 4 (upper part) an electrical terminal in a cavity  (14) in an insulating housing has a loop shaped wire receiving  part (40) having a wire receiving slot (44) formed in its free end  portion (42).  a wire (72) can be inserted through a wire receiving  opening, bounded by an edge (73), in the wire receiving  part (40) to extend across the mouth of the wire receiving slot  (44).  as shown in the lower part of figure 4 a tool (70) can be  driven against the edge (73) to deform the wire receiving part  (40), guided by an arcuate surface (58) of the housing, to force  the electrically conductive core of the wire (72) into the slot  (44).
