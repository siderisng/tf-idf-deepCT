<ABSTRACT>
In a plastic film shaped by deep-drawing containers, the connection of the two container parts with each other by interlaceable and push-button-like connecting parts are manufactured by interlinkable and push-button-like connecting parts, the interlinked connecting parts do not act in their counterests yet push-button like and may be cylindrical.When both parts are assembled, a widening of these head areas is achieved by common impressions of the head regions of each other assembled connecting parts, so that the two connection parts are positively connected together.Preferably, in the head area parallel to the plug-in direction extending beads are provided, which promote the stretchability of the head area.Particularly preferred is a frusto-conical or curved shape of the head end of the connecting parts.
