<ABSTRACT>
a mechanism for adjusting a roller type stock guide  includes a cylindrical nut including two tubular sections  (45, 46) having theraded connections of opposite hands  with a pair of threaded connections of opposite hands with  a pair of threaded shafts (15, 16) being arranged between  two roller holders (2, 3) and turnable for moving the  threaded shafts (15, 16) in opposite directions thereby to  vary the distance between the guide rollers (4, 5).  for manually adjusting the guide rollers (4, 5) easily  and in one operation a ratched type driving mechanism is  provided which includes a ratched wheel (44) formed  around the cylindrical nut (45, 46) integrally therewith, a  pair of ratchet paws movable into and out of meshing enÂ­ gagement with the ratchet wheel (44) in alternate fashion  under the action of a manually operable control cam (19),  and a notching lever handle (60) manually operable to  turn the ratchet wheel (44) and cylindrical nut (45, 46) in  an intermittent fashion through the intermediary of either  one of the ratchet pawls as placed in mesh with the ratched  wheel (44).
