<ABSTRACT>
1.  improved installation for the manufacture of elongated prestressed products and especially for prestressed girders from ductile concrete on the tracks of a prefabricating bench, this installation comprising a non-stop drawing mill adapted to allow its movement along the bench and comprising at its rear section drawing dies with openings shaped to the profil of the products to be manufactured and open cross-wise at their lower sections at the level of the tracks to match the breadth of the aforesaid product beads, the said installation being characterized in that the drawing mill comprises at the rear end of the drawing dies a movable blanking plate provided with identations shaped and located to match the prestressed cables so as to enable them to lodge into the indentation during lowering of the plate, and guiding and driving means adapted to enable the said plate to shift between  an upper position where the drawing dies are completely cleared off and a lower position where the plate extends near the tracks and blanks the aforesaid drawing dies.
