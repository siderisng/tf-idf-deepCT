<ABSTRACT>
a storage rack for nuclear fuel assemblies is located  in the pool and formed of grids (10, 12, 14, 16), each grid  formed of fixedly connected cross members (18, 20).   four separate grids are horizontally restrained by adja­ cent walls in a manner which restrains forces perpen­ dicular to each wall but permits sliding in response to  forces paralel to each wall.  each of the grids are support­ ed at locations between the grids, by members (26) which  slidably support the grids.  the support members are  further slidably supported on a central column (28).
