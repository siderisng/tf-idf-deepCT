<ABSTRACT>
neutron absorbing article.  e. g.  a plate, suitable for use in  storage racks for spent nuclear fuel prevent uncontrolled  nuclear reactions, composed of finely divided boron carbide  particles and a solid, irreversibly cured phenolic polymer  forming a continuous matrix about the boron carbide  particles which contain at least 6% by weight of b¹⁰;  preferably, the phenolic polymer is a phenol-formaldehyde-type  polymer, and the proportions of boron carbide and  phenol-formaldehyde-type polymer (preferably free of  halogens, mercury, lead and sulfur) are from 20 to 35% of the  former and 65 to 80% of the latter.  method for the manufacture of the article wherein a  portion of the phenol-formaldehyde-type resin, in the liquid  state, is mixed with the boron carbide particles, compacted  and cured, after which the cured article is impregnated with  additional phenol-formaldehyde-type resin, which is then  cured to make the final product
