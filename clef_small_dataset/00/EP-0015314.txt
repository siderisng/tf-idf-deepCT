<ABSTRACT>
Power supply in rotating cylindrical platinum printers. The feeder according to the invention comprises a platinum cradle (1), mounted with rotation, by simple engagement, on an axis (41) parallel to the plate (42). The cradle (1) supports reverse and front feeders (23 and 24) which can be selectively cleared from the plate (42) or brought into contact with it by rotation in one direction or the other of the cradle. (1) on the axis (41). The rotation of the cradle (1) is ensured by a rotating comb (50) whose elastic blades (53, 53) can be selectively brought into contact with the ends (18, 19) of legs (7 and 8) integral with the cradle (1). When the rear water (23) is released from the plate (42), the paper (60) can be introduced and its front edge (65) aligned with a retractable alignment element (45), also mounted on the cradle ( 1). Device usable on all rotating cylindrical platinum printers machines.
