<ABSTRACT>
Chuck for lathes with clamping jaws (2) made of an axially front baking portion (2a) and an axially rear baking portion (2b), each guided radially adjustable in the feed body (1). The rear baking portion (2b) is on the one hand with a drive member (4) for the jaw adjustment, on the other hand with the front baking portion (2a) by an externally actuated coupling piece in engagement, which is axially guided as a slide (8) in the rear baking portion (2b) . For a change in the clamping diameter, the front baking portion (2a) can be adjusted relative to the rear baking portion (2b) without the connection with the drive member (4) must be released. If the slide (8) is not in fully engaged clutch state, the clamping movement is automatically locked and thereby preventing the start of the lathe. For this purpose, the chuck body (1) on the opposite baking portion (2a) opposite side of the rear baking portion (2b) has a stop surface (19) for the rear end face (20) of the slider (8), which in the slide (8) in the Dispressed clutch state locks. In the stop surface (19) is a recess (21), in which the slider (8) can occur with the corresponding position of the rear baking portion (2b) to the complete decoupling of the front baking portion (2a) from the rear baking portion (2b). In the recess (21, the slider (8) is positively held against radial adjustments, so that the rear baking portion (2b) is not capable of radial adjustments with each other, not or only incomplete baking portions (2a, 2b).
