<ABSTRACT>
a power press in which a ram (12) is driven towards and  away from a press bed (11) so that, in use, a work piece is  deformed by a tool (16) mounted between the ram and the  press bed is provided with means by which a jam in the press  can be released both quickly and simply, this release means  comprising a layer (2, 3) of heat softenable rigid plastics  material which is located in the press so that the direction of  the press stroke is substantially normal to the layer and so  that during a pressing operation the layer is subjected to  compressive stress in the direction of press stroke, and  electrical heating means (5) located so that it is capable of  heating the layer (2, 3) of plastics material, when desired, to a  temperature sufficient for the plastics material to soften  whereby, under compression in the direction of the press  stroke, the thickness of the plastics layer (2, 3) decreases.   preferably the electrical heating means (5) comprises an  element which is embedded in a metal layer (1) which fits  face to face with the plastics layer, and is preferably  sandwiched between two plastics layers (2) and (3), to form a  spacer assembly (1, 2, 3) which is fitted in the press, usually  between the tool (16) and the ram (12), or between the tool  (16) and the press bed (11).
