<ABSTRACT>
a christmas tree base or the like with a cross-shaped  stand or the like, on the legs (4) of which holders (6) for the  trunk or the like are provided, which by springs (9) are  capable to draw the holders (6) to the centre of the base.  a  cam disc (10) is located centrally in the base.  the cams of  said disc (10) upon rotation in one direction push the holders  (6) outward from the centre.  upon rotation in the other  direction, the springs (9) draw the holders (6) inward to the  centre whereby the holders (6) with their upper portion abut  the trunk.  the holders (6) are slidable on the legs (4) with a  certain play, so that a "chest drawer effect" arises upon  abutment of the holders to the trunk and thereby locking is  effected.  the springs (9), therefore, can be dimensioned so  small that the rotation of the disc (10) in one direction or the  other does not require much force, because the disc (10)  preferably is located in such a plane that it automatically  neutralizes the action of the "chest drawer effect".
