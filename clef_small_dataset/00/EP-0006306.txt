<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to an apparatus for the treatment  of molten metal with a reactive additive.  the apparatus comprises (1, 2) a pouring cup (4) hav足 ing an outlet for introduction of both reactive additive and  molten metal into a reaction chamber (7).  the reaction  chamber communicates via a channel (12), preferably of  restricted cross-sectional area, with an expansion chamber  (15) provided with an outlet (16) for the molten metal.  the  expansion chamber outlet has a smaller cross-sectional  area than the pouring cup outlet (6) thereby ensuring that  the reaction chamber is sufficiently filled to cover any reac足 tive additive during a pouring treatment.  the apparatus  permits a series of pourings to be effected without disas足 sembly of the apparatus to introduce more reactive ad足 ditive.
