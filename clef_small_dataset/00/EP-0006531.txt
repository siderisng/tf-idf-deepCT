<ABSTRACT>
a push-pull driver circuit wherein the input signal (1)  is applied to turn on one (6) of two transistors (5, 6)  mounted in series and the inversion of that signal is appli­ ed to the second transistor (5) in the series path and the  output taken from between then operates to isolate the  load and since one and only one of the two transistors  in the series path is conducting there is a path to charge  and discharge the load capacitance (3) but no path  through both devices for power dissipation.  the driver  circuit can be built into a 2-bit partitioning circuit (23)  which in turn, when used with a programmed logic array  (20) and the relative capacitance of the various parts  being isolated from each other by a coupling circuit (54)  the resulting assembly provides a high performance pro­ grammed array logic device.
