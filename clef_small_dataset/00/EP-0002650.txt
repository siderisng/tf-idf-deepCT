<ABSTRACT>
apparatus is provided for controlling, during unoccupied  periods, the operation of an hvac system (16) and  perimeter heating system (17) providing hot air and hot fluid,  respectively, to a temperature controlled living space having  occupied and unoccupied periods, the apparatus including  an electronic processing means in combination with dedicated  sensing apparatus, the apparatus providing controlled  actuation of the hvac (16) and perimeter (17) heating system  in dependence on the temperature difference between an  actual space temperature signal and unoccupied space heat  and cool reference temperature signals, the apparatus  further providing an optimum start-up procedure including  simultaneous actuation of the hvac (16) and perimeter (17)  heating system to accelerate the heating of the space, the  hvac discharge temperature being modulated during the  start-up procedure in dependence on the temperature difference  between the actual space temperature and an occupied  space heat reference temperature signal, the perimeter  heating system (17) discharge temperature being preset to a  start-up reference discharge temperature having a value  greater than that maximum perimeter heating system discharge  temperature permitted in normal operation.
