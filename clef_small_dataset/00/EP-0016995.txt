<ABSTRACT>
the needle head (1) of a needle printer is near the printing point (2) on a round bar (7) by means of the reactive force in the printing of receiving, fixed on the needle head (1) mounted profile rollers (8) and by means of the gravity of the needle head (1) receiving,Resiliently at this ge stored guide rollers (9) and on the pressure point (2) facing away from the head end on a strip (15) sliding.For displacing the needle head (1), a rope drives with a via a pulley (17) on the needle head (1) and via further pulleys (19, 23, 24) and a traction disk (26) guided rope (31, 32, 33,34, 35), of the ends (29, 30) are fixed in addition to the ends of the round bar (7) stationary.As a result, the needle printer can be performed small and easily and work exactly with strong shocks.
