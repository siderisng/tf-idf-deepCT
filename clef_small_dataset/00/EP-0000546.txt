<ABSTRACT>
d-homo oxasteroids and processes for their preparation,  which can be used as anti-inflammatory agents, the  steroids having the formula    or the 1,2-dehydro derivative thereof; wherein r₁ is hydrogen,    alkyl--o-,    aryl--o-,   halogen or hydroxy; r₂is hydrogen or alkyl; r₃ is alkyl; r₄ is  carbonyl, β-hydroxymethylene, β-chloromethylene or  β-bromomethylene; r₅ is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or  bromine; r₆ is hydrogen, fluorine or methyl; and r₇ is hydrogen,  chlorine or bromine; with the proviso that when r₁ is  hydroxy, r₂ is alkyl; and with the further proviso that when  r₂ is alkyl, it is the same alkyl group as r₃; wherein aryl is  phenyl or phenyl substituted with one or two alkyl, alkoxy or  halogen groups; and alkyl and alkoxy are groups having 1 to  10 carbon atoms.
