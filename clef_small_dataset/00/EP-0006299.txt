<ABSTRACT>
aqueous gels are used as growth media for plants  which have grown beyond the cotyledon stage.  the plant  may be a seedling which has been germinated on the gel  and which is grown on to a size suitable for transplanting;  or a cutting which is stuck in the gel.  alternatively, the gel  can be formed around the root ball of a plant grown in an­ other medium, so as to provide a gelled body around the  roots to provide water to the plant during storage and trans­ port of the plant.

<DESCRIPTION>
the present invention relates to a process for growing plants. plants are conventionally grown in a growth medium such as soil or a peat compost. however, this method is cuirbersore in that the growth medium has to be maintained noist. also the p:ediuiti is usually opaque and it is impossible to judge how the roots of the plant have developed. furthermore, the composition of naturally occurring materials sugh as peat or soil varies and consistently reproducable agronomic results from a number of samples is difficult. we have now devised a method for growing plants which is convenient and simple to operate and reduces the above problerns. the present invention provides a method for gro4ng plants to beyond the cotyledon stage which comprises supporting the growth of the plant in an aqueous plant physiologically acceptable gel. whilst it has been proposed to use gels as a carrier medium for germinated seeds in transferring the seeds from the locus where they have been germinated usually a piece of blotting paper) to the growth tedium, e.g. peat or soil, where the germinated seeds are to grow on further, the gel has merely served as the carrier medium and it has hitherto been considered essential to provide a conventional growth medium for growing the seeds beyond the germination stage. the use of a gel as the medium in which the plant is grown offers the advantage that the gel will usually provide all the fluid necessary to support growth of the plant without the need to add water throughout the growth period. this avoids the need to monitor the water content of the growing medium during initial growth. the gel will often be transparent and development of the root structure of the plant can be readily observed. the gels for present use are characterised in that they contain a major proportion of water, typically at least 90% by weight, e.g. 95 to 99µ0, and are preferably thixotropic. thically, the gel will contain from 0.5 to 10° by weight of gelling agent. suitable gels for present use include silica gels; clay gels (e.g. those made using bentonite, fullers earth, smectite, hectorite, attapulgite clays and/or montmorillonite); natural gels (e.g. those made using cellulose derivatives, xanthans, polypeptides, saccharide polymers, alginates, gelatine or agar agar); synthetic organic gels (e.g. those made using cellulose derivatives or long chain glycols, notably those available under the trade name of carbopol); and inorganic gels (e.g. those pade using finely divided powders e.g. fume silica). the gels for present use may be made up in any suitable manner, depending upon the type of gelling agent used. it is preferred that the gel be put up in a suitable form, e.g. in a small pot, in a tray or as a self-supporting cube or cylinder, for r the growth of plants therein. the gel may incorporate plant nutrients dissolved in or dispersed in the gel or as a surface layer on the gel. suitable plant nutrients include calcium, potassium and/or ammonium salts of nitric

claims   1. a plant which has grown to beyond the cotyledon stage and which has its roots or part of its stem supported in a plant physiologically acceptable aqueous gel.   2. a method for growing plants to beyond the cotyledon stage which   comprises    supporting the growth of the plant in a plant physiologically acceptable aqueous gel.   3. a method as claimed in claim 2 wherein seeds are germinated on the gel and the subsequent seedlings are grown on in the gel.   4. a method as claimed in claim 2 which comprises inserting a cutting from a plant into a plant physiologically acceptable aqueous gel.   5. a method as claimed in claim 2 which comprises removing the plant from another   growth    medium and enveloping its roots in the gel for storage and/or transport.    6. a method as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 5 wherein a nutrient is provided to the plant by applying an aqueous solution of nutrient to fissures formed by partial dehydration of the gel.   7. a plant physiologically acceptable aqueous gel suitable for use in supporting a plant which has grown to beyond the cotyledon stage which gel has a surface layer containing an ingredient which aids or protects plant growth.   8. a gel as claimed in claim 7 wherein the surface layer acts to reduce loss of water from the gel by evaporation.   9. a gel as claimed in claim 8 wherein the surface layer contains  a plant nutrient.   10. a plant, method or gel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the gel incorporates a plant nutrient.
