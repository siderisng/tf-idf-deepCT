<ABSTRACT>
an adapter for use in an electrical data-pulse communication  system, and a system incorporating such an adapter.   the adapter has a buffer (17a) for holding data messages, a  control unit (17c), and a circuit (16) for placing coded data  messages on a selected trunk line (14) and for selectively  receiving coded data messages.  by providing one such  adapter in each of multiple equipments (10, 11) in the  communication system linked to transmission lines (14) the  equipments (10, 11) are rendered able to communicate  directly with one another without the provision of central  communication management.

<DESCRIPTION>
data-pulse co}1} z icatics syst'1 and adapter without reference to any specific configuration or any specific patents, it is knows that there are a multitude of communication systems, patented and unpatented, for data conmunications between and among central processor units (cpus) and associated peripheral equipments (pes) such as mass storage devices, printers, terminals and the like. basically, in these communication systems the data is transmitted either serially or in parallel. serial transmission has the advantage of less bulk, that is, fewer transmission lines or wires and less circuitry necessary to control, code and decode the data, but suffers from lack of speed of transmission. parallel transmission provides much higher data rates but requires a multiplicity of lines and circuits therefore creating greater bulk and greater power requirements, etc. in general, prior systems for communication between cpus and multiple pes have created tremendous management problems to transfer the huge amounts of data between the elements in the system. often part or all of a general purpose processor had to be utilized merely to manage the transfer of data between and amongst the various other units in the system. but even this has its shortcomings. all of the data has to flow through the managing processor which can create a bottleneck in the flow of massive amounts of data between various units. the present invention seeks to obtain the best of the two systems of parallel and serial transmission of computer data. the invention utilizes single wire coaxial cable trunk lines with multiple drops, i.e., with various equipments or units connected onto the trunk lines at various locations along the line. this avoids the bulky multiple wire cables which had been used previously for providing parallel communications between various processors and associated peripheral equipment. the coaxial cable trunk lines permit high data rate transfer between units. in the past, if it became necessary to increase the distance between units in communication with one another, the speed of transfer of the data was reduced or parallel paths of transmission had to be provided. in the present invention it is possible to connect a large number of units to each of the coaxial cable trunks lines over quite long distances without substantially affectine or slowing down the data rate transmission. as a feature of the invention, therefore, because there are substantially fewer interconnected wires, the likelihood of error or malfunction occurring in the transmission of the data is reduced. the features and advantages of the present invention are obtained by providing each of the units in the cominunication system, whether it be a cpu or pe, with an adapter. the unit is then linked with the adapter and only the adapter is connected into the trunk line. this eliminates the need for a central communication management and permits the cpus and the pes to communicate directly between and amongst one another. as yet a further feature of the invention, different makes of cpus and pes are linked to one another even though their respective
