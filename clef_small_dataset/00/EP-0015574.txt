<ABSTRACT>
for, for example, for hunting purposes ge shot with a bullet bodies tapered to the front end (2; 10; 15; 31; 41 51; 61), the vulnerabilities in the region of its tapered front end (2a) in the form of preferably obliquely to its longitudinal axis ( 6; 22) extending cuts (13; 20) and / or notches (5; 55; 65) whose a wall (46; 56; 66) forms one of the rotation of the flying projectile counteracting resistor, so that in flight the Rotation of the Gerse Ses is braked and the projectile shows an unstable flight behavior after flying out of the desired range, so that it is overlapped and quickly falling down. But when it comes to a destination. In some embodiments, it is noticeably reinforced in some exemplary examples in flight by the pawn and thus achieving a we kung's goal. This bullet is established by first pressing into a front end of a Zylindri rolling blank (26) inwardly tapered hole (27), followed by outer or inside into the hole surrounding wall as vulnerabilities the nuts and / or notches (28) and then the perforated end of the blank to a tip (29) with substantially cylindrical or conical central hole (3) extended at the outer end (4), which has a male inserted as a closure piece or insert A hood can be plugged.
