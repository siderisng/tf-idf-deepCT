<ABSTRACT>
polyphosphazene copolymers are prepared which con­ tain randomly distributed repeating units represented by the  formulas:    wherein x is an unsaturated radical represented by the for­ mulas: - o₂ or    wherein r is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon  atoms or aryl; wherein r₁, r₂ and r₃ are independently  selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted  and unsubstituted alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 15 car­ bon atoms, substituted and unsubstituted cycloalkyl, aryl,  arylalkyl, and heterocyclic radicals; wherein x′ is selected  from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstituted  alkoxy, aryloxy, amino and mercapto groups and wherein 20  <(a + b + c) < 50,000 per polymer.  the polyphosphazene copolymers of the invention are pre­ pared by reacting the enol or enolate form of a pyruvate ester  or the enol form of an aldehyde or ketone and an additional  reactant such as an aliphatic or aromatic alcohol, a mercaptan  or an amine compound with poly(dichlorophosphazene) in  the presence of a tertiary amine.  the copolymers may be  modified by crosslinking or curing.   the copolymers of the invention can be utilized to form  solvent resistant protective films and may also be utilized in  applications for moldings, coatings and the like.  additionally,  the copolymers may be utilized as crosslinking agents for  other reactive monomers or polymers.  an especially useful  feature of copolymers containing substituents derived from  pyruvate esters is that they can be cured or crosslinked at  room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
polyphosphazene copolymers containing unsaturated substituents derived from pyruvate esters and aldehydes or ketones background of the invention this invention relates to polyphosphazene copolymers containing repeating emi1.1 units in the polymer chain in which an unsaturated substituent derived from a pyruvate ester and other compatible substituents are attached to the phosphorous atom. - the invention further relates to polyphosphazene copolymers containinq repeating emi1.2 units in the polymer chain in which unsaturated substituents derived from aldehydes or ketones and other compatible substituents are attached to the phosphorous atom. more particularly, the invention relates to polyphosphazene copolymers containing unsaturated substituents represented by the formulas emi1.3 emi1.4 (defined below) and other compatible¯¯¯ substituents in which the unsaturated substituents serve as curing or crosslinking sites for the copolymers. polyphosphazene copolymers containing small amounts of certain unsaturated substituents which are capable of undergoing further reaction (i.e., crosslinking) at temperatures ranging from 200d to 3500f are described in u.s. patents 3,702,833; 3,844,983; 3,888,799 and 4,055,520. as described in the aforementioned patents, these reactive unsaturated substituents may be unsaturated monovalent radicals such as emi1.5 -orcf=cf2 and -och2rf=cf2 where r is an aliphatic or aromatic radical. the copolymers described in the above patents exhibit a number of advantageous properties as a result of the inclusion of small amount of the above described unsaturated substituents therein. thus, the copolymers when crosslinked are useful as solvent and chemically resistant coatings, sealant, potting compounds and so forth. however, the copolymers of these prior art patents require elevated temperatures i.e., 200 to 3500f to affect crosslinking. in contrast, copolymers of this invention which contain, as the cure site unsaturated substituents derived from pyruvate esters can be crosslinked or cured at room temperature. alternatively, such copolymers may be cured at elevated temperatures, if desired. in addition, while the aforementioned patents disclose copolymers containing various alkoxy substituents, such unsaturated substituents are not the same as the unsaturated substituents of the copolymers of the present invention. moreover, the method of preparation employed in those patents cannot be utilized to form unsaturated substituents (i.e., 4,ss r -alkenoxy substituents) from aldehydes or ketones. thus, for example, polyphosphazene copolymers containing certain alkenoxy groups have been disclosed in d.s. 3,702,833 to rose et al. this patent shows the preparation of these polyphosphazene copolymers through the reaction of at least two different alkali metal fluoroalkoxides and a small percentage of an alkali metal alkylene alkoxide with a soluble polymer of phosphonitrilic chloride in benzene. disclosed unsaturated substitution groups include emi2.1 which are substituted by the reaction of their alkali metal salts with polyphosphonitrilic chloride. however, the method of preparation of the alkylene alkoxy polyphos phazene as set forth in u.s. 3,702,833 using the alkali metal salt subs litut}cn procajre produces a polymer having snaracterislics -bstan--ally different than copolymers containingg,ss-alkenoxy substituents derived. from ketones and aldehydes as produced by the present invention. the substitution method used in u.s. 3,702,833 promotes the condensation of aldehydes and ketones and results in the production of a polymer in the form of an undefined tarry mass.
