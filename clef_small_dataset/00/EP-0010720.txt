<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a fully electronic loop closure circuit.  if subscriber line circuits are extended by means of multiplexing systems, an exchange terminating circuit of the exchange must send loop closure signals without damping by this means the speech currents.  in this arrangement, this should occur without using a relay contact.  for this purpose, the invention provides for arranging between the two wires of a subscriber line a constant-current load which can be connected to or disconnected from the subscriber line in dependence on the control of the subscriber set by an optocoupler.  a fully electronic loop closure circuit according to the invention is particularly suitable for use in exchange terminating circuits and concentrators in the af band of carrier frequency systems.  <image>
