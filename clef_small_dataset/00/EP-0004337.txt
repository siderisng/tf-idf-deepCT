<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for developing printing plates with pairwise, in particular horizontally arranged upper and uteres rollers for transporting the printing plates, whereby these rolls optionally also serve to squeeze from the residual liquid adhering to the printing plates. Each upper roller (4, 5, 6, 7) has each at each end which is lifted with respect to the lower roller and recessed bearing (8, 9, 10, 11), which is disposed over a toggle arrangement (15, 16, 17, 18 ) is operable. For attack on the bearings (8, 9, 10, 11) of the upper rollers (4, 5, 6, 7), a pivotable clef (eg 31) is provided with an upper and a lower arm (33, 34), whose pivot axis (32) is directed parallel to the printing plate transport direction (T) whose upper arm (33) through the knee lever assembly (15) with the parts (26, 27, 28, 29, 30) in the lowered state of the bearing (8) from above The bearing pushes and its lower arm (34) supports the bearing in the raised state. A first end of each knee lever assembly (15, 16, 17, 18) is connected to the fork head (eg 31), and a second end of each knee lever assembly (15, 16, 17, 18) is associated with a rotatable switching shaft common to all toggle arrangements (19 ), z. b. In conjunction with the section (20), wherein the switching shaft (19) is also mounted parallel to the printing plate transport direction (T).
