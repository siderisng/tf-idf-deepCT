<ABSTRACT>
the invention concerns the purification of wash water  used to remove particulate carbon and ash from mixtures  of co and hydrogen obtained by partial oxidation of fuel in  a gas generator (15).  the gas mixture generated is generally  cleaned by washing with water in quench tank (76) or  scrubbers (41, 91 or 94) and the resulting dispersion of  carbon and water is contacted with a liquid extractant in  decanter (61).  the resultant partially purified water is  flashed in flash column (149) forming steam which passes  up through tray (148), and water on the tray, and leaving  water and solids which fall into chamber (158).  a second  chamber (156) is fed by overflow from chamber (158)  and tray (148).  vapours leaving the top of flash column  (149) are condensed and water separating from the condensed  vapours is returned to flash column (149) above  tray (148).

<DESCRIPTION>
process and apparatus for producing synthesis gas with wash water purification this invention relates to a process for the partial oxidation of carbonaceous fuels involving a gas cleaning process carried out in an apparatus including a novel flash column for water reclamation. more specifically, this process involves cooling and scrubbing the raw gas stream from a partial oxidation gas generator with reclaimed water and recovering, purifying, and recycling the water. synthesis gas mixtures comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and containing entrained particulate carbon, may be prepared by the partial oxidation of a fossil fuel with a freeoxygen containing gas, optionally in the presence of a temperature moderator. the hot effluent gas stream from the gas generator may be cooled by direct immersion in water in a quench drum such as described in u.s. patents no. 2,896,927 and 3,929,429. a portion of the entrained solids will be removed by the quench water. following the direct quench cooling, the gas is scrubbed with water to remove further particulates. alternatively, the hot effluent gas stream may be cooled in a gas cooler, such as shown in u.s. patent no. 3,920,717 and then scrubbed with water. the quench-water or the scrubbing water may then be processed in the manner described in u.s. patents no. 2,992,906; 3,097,081 and 4,014,786. the object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for processing the quench-water or scrubbing water obtained in a process for producing synthesis gas. this invention provides a process for producing gaseous mixtures comprising h2 and co, by the partial oxidation of a hydrocarbonaceous fuel with a free-oxygen containing gas in a non-catalytic gas generator (15) at a temperature of 705 to 16500c and a pressure in the range of 98 to 24520 kpa, cooling the resulting gas stream and contacting the gas stream with water, thereby removing solids and producing a clean gas stream and a carbon-water dispersion containing any ash, mixing a liquid organic extractant with said carbon-water dispersion, and separating by gravity in a decanter (61) a liquid extractantparticulate carbon dispersion containing gaseous impurities and a dilute water stream containing carbon, ash and gaseous impurities characterized by (a) introducing said dilute water stream from decanter (61) at reduced pressure into a vertical flash column (149) comprising at least one stripping plate and first and second bottom chambers (158, 156) separated by a weir (157) each stripping plate containing dispersive means for dispersing steam produced below said stripping plate through the water on said stripping plate, and overflow and downflow means for removing stripped water from each plate and discharging same into said second bottom chamber, said dilute water stream being introduced below the bottom stripping plate and in the space above said first bottom chamber, thereby vaporizing a portion of said water stream, and passing the vapors up through said dispersive means in each stripping plate and through the water contained on each plate thereby stripping gases from the water on each plate, and introducing the unvaporized portion of said
