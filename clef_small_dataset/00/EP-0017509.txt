<ABSTRACT>
a fitment (2) is described supported on an elongate  member (1) provided with at least one elongate slot or  groove (3) extending therealong and configured for sliding  reception of a root-end portion (4) of the fitment (2) inserted  therein.  the root-end portion of the fitment (2) is shaped to  allow pivotal movement of the fitment about the axis of the  slot or groove while located therein.  the root-end portion of  the fitment is provided with locking means (9) which  co-operate with the slot or groove (3) to secure the fitment to  the support in a position which may be selected both  longitudinally and pivotally.  a display system is described in which one or more  fitments are supported from uprights.  each upright compris­ es an extruded section defining one or more elongate slots  or grooves.  the one or more fitments have root-end portions  received in the slots or grooves so as to be longitudinally  slidable therein and so as to be movable therein in the  manner of a hinge or of a socket joint.  the fitments are  selectively lockable in the slots or grooves.

<DESCRIPTION>
supporting fittlenlts description in its broadest context, the present invention is concerned with the support of fitments generally. more particularly, but by no means exclusively, the invention is concerned with display systems of the kind in which fitments such as panels are supported from uprights. many such systems, which may be used for the display of products or information and also for demountable partitioning-in open-plan office environments, are available on the market. the available systems are commonly based on a square or hexagonal module; that is: they include uprights, usually formed as extrusions which have slots running therealong spaced about the axis of the upright at 600 or 900 angular separations. the panels or the like are fitted directly into these slots. based on a hexagonal module, the panels will for an angle between each other of 600 or 1200 degrees. based on a square module, the panels form an angle of 900 or an angle of 1800 relative to each other. it is frequently not easy to fit the systems together or to adjust them. the present invention seeks, inter# alia, to provide a display system which is relatively simple in construction and is readily .djustable to neet the needs of the user. in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided in combination: a. fitment and a support therefor, the support comprising an elongate member provided with at least one elongate slot or groove extending therealong and configured for sliding receipt of a root -end portion of the fitment inserted the -ein, the root -end portion of the fitment being shaped to allow pivotal movement of the fitment about the axis of the slot or groove while located therein, and the root-end portion of the fitment being provided with locking means adapted for cooperation with the slot or groove for securing the fitment to the support in a position which may be selected both longitudinally and pivotally. the support need not comprise a vertical post. it may for example extend horizontally, or indeed at any angle between horizontal and vertical depending upon the particular requirements. the fitment may comprise virtually anything which it is desired to support. examples which spring to mind include lighting fitments, receptacles, brackets, shelving, and panels. no doubt other fitments which could usefully be supported in the manner of the present invention will readily occur to the reader. the elongate member may conv#eniently be formed as an extrusion of aluminium or its alloys or of pl-as-tics. the slot or groove may conveniently be formed as a part cylindrical surface, and in that case the root-end portion of the fitment may suitably be formed as a cylinder with an integral web or flans to which, for example, a display panel may be coupled by threaded connectors. the pivotal movement of the fitment relative to the support will ten b the nature of a hinge. the locking means suitably comprise means mounted on the root-end portion and which can be expanded by application o a

 as an   alternztjve    to the   hinges rue    arrangement   described above and illustrated in figs 1 and 2, the root-end portion of the fitment may, as illustrated in fig. 3, comprise a ball 13 similarly received in the slot or groove 3 of the upright 1 so as to be slidable therealong. the ball 13 is also provided with locking means extending along the line indicated at 14 in fig. 3,' which locking means may again consist of a threaded member adapted to be turned by an allen key. the arrangement of fig. 3 allows additional degrees of freedom in variation of the position and orientation of the fitment.    in a practical display system, one or more panels may be supported on an   upright    1 in the manner shown in figs. 1 and 2 and one or more display lighting fitments may be supported from the same upright in the manner of fig. 3 allowing the direction of the light to be varied over a substantial solid angle as well as the position of the light fitment to be varied in height along the upright. the   central -hollow    of the-extrusion can conveniently carry electric wiring.     7. the combination of any preceding claim, wherein the slot or groove is formed as a part cylindrical surface, and the root-end portion of the fitment is formed as a cylinder with an integral web or flange, whereby pivotal movement of the fitment is in the manner of a hinge.    8. the combination of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the slot or groove is formed as a part cylindrical surface, and the root-end portion comprises a ball so that pivoting of the root-end portion in the slot is in the manner of a socket joint, 9. the combination of claim 6 or of any claim appendent thereto, wherein the root-end portions are selectively lockable in the slots or grooves by means mounted on the rootend portion and which can be expanded by application of   åa    tool to wedge the root-end portion in the slot.   10. the combination of claim 9, wherein the locking means comprise a threaded member with a head dimensioned forreception of an allen key.
