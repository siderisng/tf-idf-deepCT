<ABSTRACT>
a delay circuit comprising counter circuits (32, 34), a  flip-flop circuit (36), circuits (30, 40) for hold-ing the flip-flop  circuit in its reset situation for the duration of first signals (xo,  yo) and a gate circuit (38) receiving a second signal (sd) and  operated by the output of the flip-flop circuit (36).  according to  this delay circuit, a relatively large delay may be easily  accomplished in a digital manner during the period up to the  stoppage of output of a second signal after the termination of  the first signal, even by the use of integrated circuits.  this is  adapted to be used for the tuning circuit for electronic-tuning  type radio receivers.
