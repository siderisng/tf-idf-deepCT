<ABSTRACT>
METHOD AND DEVICE Forming, on the end of a pipe (1) of thermoplastic material, a Cord RAC piece having an annular groove (5) contradicted oule for receiving an annuity seal (30)wherein the connector piece is first formed by means of a forming core (9) having an annular rib (10) for forming the annular groove (5), the core (9) being extracted from thepartially cooled connecting piece with elastic deformation of the portion (4) comprising the groove (5) by the rib (10) of the forming core, that portion (4) being kept at the temperature of elastic deformation, and according to which one submits.This part (4) to a post-information operation before complete cooling by means of a post-information ring (25).
