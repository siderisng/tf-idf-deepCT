<ABSTRACT>
alumina-based ceramics for core materials having a  good leachability and being non reactive with the alloy up  to 1800°c.  the ceramic material, before firing, consists of at least  an alumina-based compound material having the general  formula mo·nal₂o₃, wherein m is na₂, ca, sr or ba, n is  from 9 to 11 when m is na₂ and n is 6 when m is ca, sr or  ba, and is, after firing, being characterized by a density of  from 40 percent to 75 percent of theoretical and an interconnected  network defining a plurality of interstices in  which undoped alumina grains are found.  application for making cores for casting directionally  solidified eutectic and superalloy materials.
