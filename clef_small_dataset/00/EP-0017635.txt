<ABSTRACT>
a pneumatic reciprocating mechanism comprising a  working member (11) reciprocably powered in a housing (10)  and forming together with a vibration absorbing reaction  support member (12) and an elastic seal element (47) a  working chamber (49) which is supplied with pressure via an  air feed valve (54,55).  the latter is positively coupled to the  working member (11) and controls the air flow through  openings (54) in the reaction support member (12) in  response to the relative positions of the working member  (11) and the reaction support member (12) the elastic seal element (47) is associated with the  working member (11) and has an annular valve collar, which  is arranged to establish sealing contact with a diverging  peripheral wall of the reaction support member (12) by radial  expansion due to the air pressure in the working member  (49).
