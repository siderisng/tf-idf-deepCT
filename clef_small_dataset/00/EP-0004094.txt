<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for preparing compostable material on a bearing surface with this spaced apart and movable charging bridge and arranged on this dispensing device, which is attached to that bearing surface, which is connected to at least one feeder to the material for discharge member. In known methods, portal racks are used for roosting of compost portions with a trash-like downstream case shaft, from which the compost partly falls very large-cloudy and forms individual bulkheads; These generate a corrugated dent surface and condition so expensive smooth work. Also, these compost rents must be implemented or ventilated several times during their service life. With previously customary ventilation systems only certain edge zones are vented, between which pillars of compacted compost od. Like. Stay, which leads to extremely foul-smelling heap. With the invention, well-ventilated rents can be produced at the most fully automatic manner, which are relatively little area and are environmentally friendly at the constant volume. Also, a high efficiency of the system or device is sought. The solution is achieved in that a low-powered layer of, for example, 40 mm height of composting material is produced from the strips adjacent with its longitudinal edges and is placed on this at least one further such layer, where appropriate, where appropriate during laying of the layer / en the composting material hard materials by accelerating the Material particles and separation between prolifeable and bulb ingredients are removed. In addition, the composting material is guided as bulk material to a stapleplatz and deformed there to pressures, which are stacked immediately then at a distance from each other, whereby the sewage sludge, optionally the sewage sludge is mixed as a debris of more than 80% moisture with crushed garbage proportions and then pressed on the stapleplace. In addition, the compost rent is vented by means of blown air, which is injected into the compost rent by means of its surface of at least vertically introduced ventilation lances; At the same time, the ventilation lances produce a system of ventilation channels or the like. In the device according to the invention, as a discharge element, a bearing surface over the band-like conveying element is approximately horizontally provided, which is approximately parallel to the bearing surface and by means of a lifting element or the like. inclined or is formed vertically. on the conveying or charging bridge or its lifting element / en / / de / or with this at least vertically movable milling odd. Like. Locker device and / or at least one pressing device with movable press ducts od. Like. For producing compressing , wherein each press channel is designed as a stacking member for the pressings or provided with such an organ. At which the surface of the compost rent at least partially overarching lifting element is attached at least one lancent-like and optionally length-changing ventilation member movable and connected to an air supply line. Above the compost rental, at least one suction or suction device is arranged and connected to at least one fan and its blow-out to the ventilation system at least one rent and / or a postpost. In addition, the bearing surface is preceded by a rotary drum which comprises a mixing portion for garbage and sludge with the repeated direction reversing of the mixed material, a shredding portion in the form of a ball mill having screen surfaces having walls and a sieve surfaces removing the outer surface extending outer surface extending outer surface.
