<ABSTRACT>
a liquid spreading device and a method of spreading a  liquid by means of this spreading device.  the spreading  device (10) includes opposed surfaces (16, 18) providing a  capillary flow zone.  each surface (14, 16) includes means (42,  44) for directing flow along predetermined paths and at least  one surface (16) includes means (26) to permit liquid introduc­ tion between the surfaces (16, 18.  at least a portion of the  paths of one surface form a positive angle (α) with respect to  the paths of the directly opposing portion of the other surface,  whereby controlled multidirectional flow of liquid introduced  between the surfaces occurs with a predetermined peripheral  configuration.  also disclosed are methods of analyzing a  liquid and test elements for them which include the spreading  device and the method of spreading the liquid.
