<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a suspension system for a vehicle  road wheel and to vehicles equipped with the suspension  system.  in particular, the invention provides a road wheel  suspension system comprising two arms (13,14) mounted for  oscillatory motion on respective fulcra (11,12) on a support  structure (10) formed by the vehicle chassis or some part of  the vehicle body, the two arms (13,14) being pivoted at their  other einds to spaced positions (15,16) on a wheel-carrying  element (17) so that there is provided an articulated quadrilateral,  and according to the invention, the wheel-carrying element  (17) has an extension (117) beyond the part of that  element which extends between the spaced pivots (15,16) of  the two arms (13,14), there being the road wheel mounting  (19) on this extension (117) of the wheel-carrying element  (17).  according to preferred features of the invention, the two  arms (13,14) may be disposed on the same side of the wheel-carrying  element (17) or on opposite sides of the wheel-carrying  element (17), and the extension (117) on which the  wheel is mounted extends in a direction approximately parallel  with the ground, when the vehicle is unloaded.  specific embodiments of the invention include a motorcycle,  a motor vehicle having the suspension system applied  to both front and rear road wheels, and the undercarriage of  an aircraft.
