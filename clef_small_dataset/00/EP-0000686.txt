<ABSTRACT>
the invention relates to a closing device for a flexible tube which is pressed to extract its contents.  this device comprises an end cap 12, made of plastic material, mounted elastically and rotatably on an end piece 10 integral with the tube 11.  it comprises two studs 14 engaged in two helical grooves 18 in such a manner that the end cap 12 is captive on the end piece 10 and its angular displacements are limited.  in one extreme position of the end cap, the interior of the tube 11 is in communication with the opening 20 via four channels 13 made in the end piece, and the tube is open.  in the other extreme position of the end cap, the end piece 10 is pressed against the bottom of the end cap, and the tube is closed.  the device according to the invention can be applied to all types of deformable tubes - metal or plastic - and to all products packed in these tubes (cosmetic, chemical, food etc. ), the tightness being guaranteed by the presence of circular ribbing at the opening and at the lower edge of the end cap.  <image>
