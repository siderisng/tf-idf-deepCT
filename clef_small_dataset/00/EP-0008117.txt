<ABSTRACT>
a hand-held cordless electric vacuum cleaner in­ cluding separable power and bowl units secured by a  releasable latch.  the power unit includes a housing form­ ed with a handle and enclosing an electric motor and  fan, batteries for the motor, and a switch for turning the  motor on and off.  the bowl unit includes a hollow bowl  provided with an air inlet opening and an integral internal  nozzle communicated with the fan when joined to the  power unit.  a filter assembly including a ring and a filter  bag is positioned wholly within the bowl between the air  inlet opening and fan and is removable from the bowl  after the units are separated, whereby dirt and debris  contained in the bowl are not spilled during separation  of the units.  a flapper covers the nozzle when the unit is  off to prevent dirt in the bowl from coming out of the  opening.
