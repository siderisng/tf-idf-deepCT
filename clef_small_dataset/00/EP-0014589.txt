<ABSTRACT>
an md diamond particle which is characterised by having  striated surfaces.  these particles key better in a metal matrix  and so also provided is a metal bonded abrasive body  containing these particles.  the particles are made by the  known method of making md diamond particles, save that a  particular alloy is used as solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
descriptio "dlliond particles" this invention relates to diamond particles and to a method of raking such particles. diamond particles of the md (metal bond) type and of the sd (saw diamond) type are used extensively in industry. both particle are strong, blocky crystals of cubo-octahedral habit and having well-defined cubic and octahedra smooth faces. such particles of synthetic origin have only a small metal inclusion content and are yellow in colour. the larger particles, i.e. of size greater than 250 microns are of the sd type and the smaller particles, i.e. the particles of size less than 250 microns, are of the md type. md diamond particles are used in metal bond grinding wheels and other such metal bond abrasive tools, while sd particles are used in saw segments and impregnated drill bits. metal bond grining wheels, saw segments and other metal bond abrasive bodies have as a common characteristic the fact that the bonding matrix is a metal or alloy. metal bond grinding wheels consist of a hub to which is bonded a peripheral grinding or working portion. the peripheral grinding portion comprises a mass of diamond or like abrasive particles held in a metal or alloy matrix. the concentration cf abrasive in the grinding portion is typically in the range 20 to 35 percent by volume. saw segments also comprise a mass of diamond or like abrasive particles held in a metal or alloy matrix, the concentration of abrasive typically being in the range 3 to 10 percent by volume. examples of matrices for metal bond abrasive bodies are bronze, cobalt, nickel and iron and alloys containing any one of these metals. hereinafter the term "md diamond particle" will be used to cover both md and sd particles. the present invention provides, according to one aspect, a novel md diamond particle having striated (or grooved) surfaces. it has been found that such particles are superior to conventional did particles because they key better to a metal matrix because of the striated surfaces. the invention also relates to the use of these particles in a metal bond abrasive body. the invention, according to this aspect, provides a metal bond abrasive body comprising a mass of md diamond particles having striated surfaces held in a metal matrix. the metal matrix may be a pure metal or an alloy. the concentration of diamond particles in the body will depend o the nature of the body as described above. the diamond content may be made up solely of the striated md particles or the diamond content may be a mixture of striated md particles and standard smooth surfaced md particles. the metal bond abrasive body will typically be the working portion of a metal bond abrasive wheel or a saw segment or an impregnated drill bit. the invention will further be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which : figure 1 is a iron/cobalt/nickel phase diagram; figure 2 is a carbon temperature/pressure phase diagram; figure 3 is a photograph of
