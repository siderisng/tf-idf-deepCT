<ABSTRACT>
self-correcting, solid-state mass-memory, organized  by bits and with reconfiguration capability for a stored pro­ gram control system, comprising a processing system in­ terfaced towards the mass memory through a controller,  said memory consisting of one or a plurality of memory  modules and a control module at least, comprising a time  base which generates timing and control signals for memo­ ry operation, with shape and period variable according to  the operation, an addressing control circuit which genera­ tes the addresses for memory reading and writing, input-­ output means which send the data towards the memory or  the controller and a self-correcting logic which controls the  right operation of the memory, corrects and signals to the  controller the possible memory errors, said memory being  characterized in that each memory module [me(1). . . me(p);  me(1). . . me(p + 1); me(1). . . me(x)] is intended to store a bit  of a plurality of words consisting of information and redun­ dancy bits to be used for self-correction operations and  comprises:   - a plurality of memory integrated circuits (ac1. . . ac32)  obtained by charge-coupled technology and consisting  of blocks of shift registers organized in serial-parallel-­ serial configuration, each block being able to be ad­ dressed randomly and at the same time as the blocks  of equal position in all the corresponding circuits of all  the memory modules and containing a plurality of cells  to be addressed in sequence;   - data input-autput means (rt1; rt1a; rt1b; rt1c;  lm2);   - means (a1, a2, de1, a!, a2, de1, lm1) for receiving  from the control module (mc) or each control module  (mca, mcb, mcc) and sending to the integrated cir­ cuits (ac) of the memory module the timing, address­ ing and control signals.
