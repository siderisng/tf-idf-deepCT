<ABSTRACT>
a ball valve assembly (10) in which the ball (14) and valve  seats (26) are readily removable from the valve housing (12),  the valve (10) being designed for a high temperature environment.   the valve seats (26) cooperate with seat supports (20)  and the ball (14), each of two valve seats (26) comprising a  single integral annular fluid-tight metallic spring member (26)  disposed between each seat support (20) and the ball (14).   each metallic spring member (26) comprises a cylindrical bellows  lenght of one or more convolutions, with special ends that  are finished in the shape of an internal spherical surface, the  same as that of the ball (14) and also that of the inner ends of the  seat supports (20).  ready removal of the ball (14) and valve  seats (26) is provided through an opening (42) concentric with  the axis of rotation of the ball stem (16).  a flange (18) is  disposed in the opening (42) and an annular portion (48) thereof  is held in abutting engagement with an annular portion (50) of  the valve body (12).
