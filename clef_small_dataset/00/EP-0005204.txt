<ABSTRACT>
The partially known 2-thiazolone-5-carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula <image> in which R¹ is hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkylmercaptoalkyl, alkyl substituted by heterocyclic radicals alkyl substituted by alkylcarbonyl, by arylcarbonyl, which in turn in the aryl part by halogen; alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio and / or nitro may further substituted for alkenyl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aralkyl or for grouping <image> in which R <4> is hydrogen, alkyl or Aryl is R <5> for alkyl, alkylcarbonyl, carbalkoxy, alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl, and also R <4> and R <5> are together with the adjacent nitrogen atom for a 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic ring, R² for hydrogen, optionally by cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylmercapto, phenoxyl, arylthio or cyano-substituted alkyl, optionally by alkyl substituted cycloalkyl or For optionally substituted aralkyl and R³ is hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl or optionally acid-stitulated aralkyl, strong plant growth regulating properties have.
