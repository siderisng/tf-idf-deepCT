<ABSTRACT>
1.  electrical charge transfer device comprising a semi-conductor substrate covered with an insulating layer on which transfer electrodes (1, 3, 5) are arranged, weighting electrodes (2, 4, 6) ensuring the separation of the charges being intercalated between said transfer electrodes, transfer and weighting electrodes ensuring the transfer of charges in the substrate on the application of given potentials and each weighting electrode being formed by at least two elementary electrodes separated, in the transfer direction, by an interruption, (20, 40, 60), the substrate comprising, at the level of the interruption an insulating diffusion zone (200, 400, 600), wherein the substrate of semi-conductor material comprises, at the level of each transfer electrode, an insulating diffusion zone (101, 301, 501), formed by the extension of the insulating zone (200, 400, 600) disposed at the level of the interruption of the following weighting electrode in the transfer direction, the dimension r of the transfer electrodes in the transfer direction and opposite to the interruption of the following weighting electrode, which is such that r = d - p1 where d represents the dimension, in the transfer direction, of the transfer electrodes (1, 3, 5) and where p1 represents the dimension, in the transfer direction, of the insulating zone (101, 301, 501) under each transfer electrode, being approximately equal to d/3.
