<ABSTRACT>
In this method, for the fumigation of the liquid on the one hand and the nitrogen elimination of other two basins are used, which are arranged concentrically to each other. By a closed horizontal flow process of both pelvic contents, an immediate liquid circulation is made possible between the basins. Input and return sludge are introduced into the inner lying pool and mixed with its contents. Part of the mixture flows through a compound between the basin in the form of a passage opening (9) in the container wall of the inner basin into the outer BEC, where it is ventilated and nitrified. This pelvic content is also due to avoiding storage in a horizontal flow movement. Through another passage opening (5), a certain amount of liquid recks into the inner basin without additional energy expenditure. Due to the oxygen content in this basin, which is between 0 and 0. 5 MGL, there is a sharpened nitrogen element.
