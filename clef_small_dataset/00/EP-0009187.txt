<ABSTRACT>
when measuring the moisture of flat samples (9) by absorption of frequency-modulated microwaves, microwaves are guided through the sample several times, for example three to five times.  this takes place in a way such that the microwaves collected by the first microwave receiver (8) are retransmitted to the sample by a microwave transmitter (7a) connected in series to said receiver.  this process can be continued.  the microwave energy not absorbed by the sample is collected and rectified by a final microwave receiver (8c) having a measuring detector (11).  a difference is formed from the rectified signal and a reference voltage (13), and the moisture in the sample is determined from this difference voltage (12).  <image>
