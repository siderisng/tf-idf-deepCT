<ABSTRACT>
in a process for preparing an aromatic urethane which  comprises reacting an aromatic nitro compound, an organic  compound containing at least one hydroxyl group, and carbon  monoxide at elevated temperature and pressure in the  presence of a catalytic system composed of a catalyst consisting  of a platinum metal, a platinum metal compound, and/or  a platinum metal compound-containing compound and a  promoter consisting of a lewis acid and/or a lewis acid-containing  compound, an organic primary amino compound,  a urea compound, a biuret compound, an allophanate compound,  or a mixture thereof is added to the reaction system  whereby the reaction rate is increased and the yield of the  desired product is enhanced.  for example, 2,4-diethylcarbamate-toluene  can be prepared at quantitative  yield by reacting 2,4-dinitrotoluene, ethanol, carbon monoxide,  and a small amount of aminonitrotoluene at elevated  temperature and pressure in the presence of palladium  chloride and ferrous chloride-pyridine complex.
